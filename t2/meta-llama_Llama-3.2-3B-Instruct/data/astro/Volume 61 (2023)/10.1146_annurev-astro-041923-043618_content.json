{"Abstract": "This review article highlights the advancements and limitations of hydrodynamical simulations in modeling galaxy populations. By leveraging cutting-edge numerical techniques and high-performance computing, simulations have successfully reproduced the observed morphology, kinematics, and chemical properties of galaxies. Notably, simulations have reproduced the formation of galaxy halos, the regulation of gas accretion, and the role of mergers in shaping galaxy evolution. However, significant challenges persist, including the treatment of dark matter, the implementation of realistic star formation and feedback mechanisms, and the accurate modeling of galaxy interactions. Despite these challenges, hydrodynamical simulations remain a crucial tool for understanding the complex dynamics of galaxy populations and predicting their future evolution."}
