{"Abstract": "The formation of the first stars in the universe is a pivotal event in the evolution of galaxies and the cosmos as a whole. Through a comprehensive review of the latest research in cosmology and astrophysics, this abstract provides an overview of the current understanding of the first stars, including their formation mechanisms, properties, and impact on the surrounding interstellar medium. The first stars, comprising the first and second stellar populations, are believed to have formed in the high-redshift Universe, approximately 13.5 billion years ago. These ancient stars are thought to have been Population III and II, with the latter being the first stars to undergo significant chemical enrichment. The formation of the first stars is closely tied to the process of galaxy assembly and the regulation of star formation. This abstract highlights the key findings from recent studies, including the detection of high-redshift galaxies and the analysis of their stellar populations. The impact of the first stars on the formation of subsequent generations of stars and the evolution of galaxies is also discussed, with implications for our understanding of the cosmic dawn and the early universe. By synthesizing the latest research in this field, this abstract provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on the first stars and their role in shaping the universe as we know it today."}
