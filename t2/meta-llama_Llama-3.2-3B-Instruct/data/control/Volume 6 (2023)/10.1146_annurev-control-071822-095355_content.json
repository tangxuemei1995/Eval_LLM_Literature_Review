{"Abstract": "The CYBATHLON competition has been a driving force in advancing assistive technologies, fostering innovation and inclusivity for individuals with disabilities. Since its inception in 2000, the competition has challenged teams to develop assistive technologies that enable people with physical disabilities to participate in daily life activities. Through a user-centered design approach, participants have created innovative solutions that address various challenges faced by individuals with disabilities. The competition has led to the development of cutting-edge technologies, such as exoskeletons, prosthetic limbs, and smart home systems, which have improved the quality of life for people with disabilities. By pushing the boundaries of assistive technology, CYBATHLON has promoted inclusion and accessibility, demonstrating the potential for technology to empower individuals with disabilities and enhance their participation in society."}
