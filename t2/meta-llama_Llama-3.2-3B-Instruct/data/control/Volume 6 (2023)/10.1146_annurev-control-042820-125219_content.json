{"Abstract": "This study investigates the control of multicarrier energy systems from buildings to networks, focusing on the integration of distributed and cooperative control strategies. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals the need for advanced control techniques to optimize energy efficiency and reliability in building energy systems. This research proposes a novel predictive control framework that leverages machine learning algorithms to predict energy demand and supply, enabling real-time adjustments to energy distribution. The proposed framework is evaluated using simulations and case studies, demonstrating significant improvements in energy efficiency and reduced strain on the grid. The findings of this study have important implications for the development of smart energy hubs and the future of building energy control."}
