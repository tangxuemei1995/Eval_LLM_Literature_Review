{"Abstract": "The manipulation of micro-scale objects using liquid surface tension has emerged as a promising approach in the field of microrobotics. By exploiting the capillary forces generated at the liquid surface, researchers have developed novel micromanipulation techniques that enable precise control over the movement and positioning of micro-scale objects. This review article provides an in-depth examination of the underlying physics of liquid surface tension and its applications in microrobotics. We discuss the various mechanisms by which surface tension can be harnessed, including the use of microfluidic channels, surface tension-driven flow, and the manipulation of liquid droplets. Recent advances in materials science and nanotechnology have also enabled the development of novel surface-tension-driven actuators and sensors, which have far-reaching implications for the design of next-generation microrobots. Our review highlights the potential of liquid surface tension as a key enabler of micromanipulation in a wide range of applications, from biomedical engineering to microassembly and microfabrication. By exploring the latest research in this field, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the opportunities and challenges associated with exploiting liquid surface tension in microrobotics."}
