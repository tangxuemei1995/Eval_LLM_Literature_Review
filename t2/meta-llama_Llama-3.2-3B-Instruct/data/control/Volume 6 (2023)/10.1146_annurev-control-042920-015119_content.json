{"Abstract": "This review provides a comprehensive examination of sequential Monte Carlo methods, a class of algorithms for state estimation and system identification in nonlinear state-space models. The paper discusses the fundamental principles of sequential Monte Carlo, including the particle filter and its variants, such as the sequential Monte Carlo method and the particle-based Kalman filter. The review covers various applications of sequential Monte Carlo, including navigation, robotics, and signal processing. Theoretical and practical aspects of sequential Monte Carlo are analyzed, including convergence properties, computational complexity, and comparison with other state estimation methods. The paper concludes by highlighting the advantages and limitations of sequential Monte Carlo and its potential for future research and development in the field of nonlinear state-space estimation."}
