{"Abstract": "This study investigates the modeling and control of multiagent systems, focusing on crowd dynamics and interacting agent systems. By applying the mean-field limit, we derive a reduced-order model that captures the essential dynamics of large-scale systems. The proposed model is then used to design feedback control strategies for autonomous vehicles, which are employed to manipulate the crowd's behavior. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the control approach in achieving desired crowd patterns and reducing congestion. The proposed framework can be extended to various applications, including smart traffic management and crowd control in public spaces. The mean-field limit approach provides a powerful tool for analyzing and controlling complex interacting agent systems, enabling the design of efficient and effective control strategies for real-world problems."}
