{"Abstract": "This study explores the evolution of construction robotics, transitioning from automation to human-robot collaboration. By integrating sensing technologies and industrial robots, construction sites can optimize efficiency and productivity. The integration of robotic systems with building information modeling (BIM) and computer-aided design (CAD) enables precise site monitoring and real-time data analysis. Human-robot collaboration enhances worker safety and reduces errors, while automation streamlines repetitive tasks. The findings of this research highlight the potential of construction robotics to transform the construction industry, improving quality, reducing costs, and increasing worker satisfaction."}
