{"Abstract": "Networked control systems (NCS) have become increasingly prevalent in modern cyber-physical systems, where real-time information exchange between sensors, actuators, and controllers is crucial for optimal performance. However, the inherent communication constraints in NCS pose significant challenges to traditional control strategies. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the many facets of information in networked estimation and control, focusing on control under communication constraints, decentralized inference, and event triggering. We discuss the importance of timing information in NCS, including its impact on system stability, performance, and robustness. Our analysis highlights the need for advanced control strategies that can effectively utilize the available information and mitigate the effects of communication constraints. We also explore the role of decentralized inference in NCS, where local agents can infer system states and control actions without relying on centralized authorities. Finally, we examine the event triggering approach, which enables controllers to adapt to changing system conditions by triggering control actions in response to specific events. By integrating these concepts, we aim to develop more efficient, scalable, and resilient control strategies for NCS, ultimately enabling the widespread adoption of these systems in various applications."}
