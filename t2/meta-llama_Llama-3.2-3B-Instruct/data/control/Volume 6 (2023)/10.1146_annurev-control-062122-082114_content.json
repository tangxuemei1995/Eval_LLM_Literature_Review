{"Abstract": "This study investigates the application of advanced robotics and control techniques to spacecraft-mounted manipulators for in-orbit servicing operations. A novel control framework utilizing dual quaternions is proposed to ensure precise trajectory tracking and robust control of the robotic arm. The dynamics and kinematics of the robotic system are analyzed, and a simulation-based approach is employed to validate the proposed control strategy. The results demonstrate improved performance and stability of the robotic arm, enabling efficient and reliable in-orbit servicing operations."}
