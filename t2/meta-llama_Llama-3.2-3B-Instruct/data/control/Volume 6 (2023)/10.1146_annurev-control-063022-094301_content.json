{"Abstract": "This study explores the concept of embodied intelligence in autonomous adaptive systems, focusing on the timescales of cross-timescale interactions. Bioinspired robotics and artificial life approaches are employed to investigate the dynamics of embodied cognition in complex systems. The research reveals that embodied intelligence enables autonomous adaptive systems to adapt and learn across multiple timescales, from milliseconds to years. Cross-timescale interactions are found to be crucial for the emergence of adaptive behaviors, such as pattern recognition and decision-making. The findings suggest that incorporating embodied intelligence into autonomous adaptive systems can lead to improved performance, robustness, and adaptability. The study contributes to the development of bioinspired robotics and artificial life approaches, highlighting the importance of considering the timescales of embodied intelligence in the design of autonomous adaptive systems."}
