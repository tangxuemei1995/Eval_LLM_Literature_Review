{"Abstract": "This study focuses on the control of low-inertia power systems, which are critical for maintaining grid stability in the face of increasing renewable energy penetration. A dynamic virtual power plant (DVPV) approach is proposed to enhance grid-forming control in low-inertia systems. The proposed control strategy utilizes advanced power electronics and machine learning algorithms to optimize energy storage, load management, and grid frequency regulation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DVPV approach in improving grid stability and reducing the impact of low-inertia systems on grid frequency. The results also show that the proposed control strategy can effectively mitigate the effects of renewable energy variability and improve the overall efficiency of the power system. The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of smart grids and the integration of low-inertia systems into the power grid."}
