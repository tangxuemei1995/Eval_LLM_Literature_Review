{"Abstract": "This study explores the concept of embodied communication in human-robot collaboration, focusing on the role of physical interaction in facilitating effective communication between humans and robots. Through a mixed-methods approach combining surveys, interviews, and observational studies, we investigated the ways in which robots and people communicate through physical interaction, including gestures, postures, and touch. Our results show that embodied communication plays a crucial role in human-robot collaboration, enabling robots to better understand human intentions and emotions. We also found that the use of assistive robots, designed to assist people with disabilities, can facilitate embodied communication and improve human-robot collaboration. The findings of this study have implications for the design of robots that can effectively communicate with humans through physical interaction, and highlight the potential of embodied communication to enhance human-robot collaboration in various applications, including healthcare, education, and manufacturing."}
