{"Abstract": "Soft robotics has emerged as a rapidly growing field of research, focusing on the design and development of robots that can interact with and manipulate soft, flexible, and deformable materials. This overview provides a comprehensive review of the current state of soft robotics, highlighting key advances in actuation, sensing, and control systems. The design of soft robots is influenced by various factors, including material properties, geometry, and topology, which are carefully optimized to achieve specific performance objectives. Simulation and modeling techniques are increasingly being employed to predict and analyze the behavior of soft robots, enabling the development of more sophisticated control strategies. Machine learning algorithms are also being explored for their potential to improve the performance and adaptability of soft robots in complex environments. Recent breakthroughs in soft robotics have enabled the development of robots capable of locomotion, manipulation, and interaction with humans, with applications in fields such as healthcare, manufacturing, and search and rescue. This review aims to provide a thorough understanding of the current state of soft robotics and its potential for future applications."}
