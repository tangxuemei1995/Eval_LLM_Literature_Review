{"Abstract": "This study aims to establish a theoretical framework for optimizing learning control policies in complex systems. By integrating reinforcement learning and feedback control synthesis, we develop a novel approach to policy optimization that balances exploration and exploitation. Our framework leverages recent advances in model-free reinforcement learning to learn optimal control policies in a data-efficient manner. We propose a novel optimization algorithm that incorporates feedback control synthesis to improve the stability and robustness of learned policies. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in optimizing learning control policies for a range of applications, including robotics and process control. The proposed framework has significant implications for the development of autonomous systems and intelligent control systems, enabling more efficient and effective learning control policies. Our results provide a foundation for future research in policy optimization and reinforcement learning."}
