{"Abstract": "The integration of additive manufacturing in the design and fabrication of soft actuators and robots has revolutionized the field of robotics, enabling the creation of complex and dynamic systems. This convergence of 4D printing and soft robotics has led to the development of novel soft actuators and robots that can adapt and respond to their environment in a more human-like manner. The use of integrated soft actuators and sensors in these systems allows for real-time feedback and control, enabling precise manipulation and interaction with the environment. This abstract reviews the current state of the art in soft actuators and robots enabled by additive manufacturing, highlighting the potential applications in fields such as healthcare, search and rescue, and space exploration. The design and fabrication of these systems are also discussed, with a focus on the challenges and opportunities presented by the integration of 4D printing and soft robotics."}
