{"Abstract": "Oxidative stress is a critical challenge for bacterial survival, and RNA molecules have emerged as key sensors of this stress. Recent studies have highlighted the role of RNA oxidation in detecting reactive oxygen species (ROS) and triggering a stress response in bacteria. This review focuses on the emerging field of RNA sensors of oxidative stress, highlighting the mechanisms of ROS-mediated RNA oxidation and the downstream signaling pathways that regulate bacterial stress response. We discuss the potential applications of RNA sensors in synthetic biology, including the design of novel biosensors and therapeutic strategies for bacterial diseases. Understanding the intricate relationships between RNA, ROS, and stress response has far-reaching implications for the development of novel antibacterial therapies and the design of more resilient bacterial systems."}
