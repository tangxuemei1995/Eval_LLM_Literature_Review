{"Abstract": "The rapid transition to a net-zero emission energy system poses significant challenges for the global energy sector. International oil companies (IOCs) have a critical role to play in this transition, as they possess extensive expertise in energy production, transport, and storage. This study examines the potential contributions of IOCs to the net-zero emission energy transition, with a focus on their existing energy carrier assets, energy transport networks, and emerging energy storage technologies. Our analysis reveals that IOCs can leverage their existing infrastructure to support the transition to low-carbon energy sources, while also developing new business models and technologies to drive innovation and growth. By integrating their expertise with emerging low-carbon technologies, IOCs can play a vital role in achieving a net-zero emission energy system."}
