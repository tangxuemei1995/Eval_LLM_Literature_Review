{"Abstract": "Lignocellulosic biomass has emerged as a promising feedstock for biorefineries, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional fossil-based materials. The valorization of lignocellulosic biomass through biorefineries can produce a range of biobased polymers, including polyhydroxyalkanoates, polyesters, and polyamides. However, the engineering of these biorefineries poses significant challenges, including the optimization of biomass conversion pathways, the development of efficient enzymes, and the integration of downstream processing technologies. This review highlights the opportunities and challenges associated with the production of biobased polymers from lignocellulosic biomass, with a focus on life-cycle management and sustainability. The potential of biorefineries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, conserve non-renewable resources, and promote circular economy principles is discussed, along with the need for further research and development to overcome the technical and economic barriers to large-scale deployment. By leveraging biobased polymer production, lignocellulosic biorefineries can play a critical role in shaping a more sustainable future."}
