{"Abstract": "Peptide-based vectors have emerged as a promising biomolecular engineering strategy for efficient gene delivery, particularly for intracellular targeting and silencing of specific genes. By leveraging the inherent properties of intracellular targeting peptides, these vectors can evade endosomal escape and deliver oligonucleotides, including siRNA and mRNA, directly to the target site within cells. This approach has shown significant potential in preclinical studies, demonstrating improved gene silencing efficacy and reduced off-target effects compared to traditional delivery methods. Furthermore, the use of peptide-based vectors has been explored in clinical trials, where they have shown promise in treating various diseases, including genetic disorders and cancer. Ongoing research is focused on optimizing the design and functionality of these vectors, with the ultimate goal of developing safe and effective peptide-based gene delivery systems for therapeutic applications. The integration of peptide-based vectors with other gene delivery technologies holds great promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies."}
