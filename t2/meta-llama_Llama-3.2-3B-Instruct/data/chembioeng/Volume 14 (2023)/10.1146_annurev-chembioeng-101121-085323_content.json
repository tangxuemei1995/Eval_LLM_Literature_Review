{"Abstract": "Deep eutectic solvents (DES) have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential to revolutionize the field of green chemistry. These solvents are formed through the combination of a hydrogen bond donor and a hydrogen bond acceptor, resulting in a eutectic mixture that exhibits a significantly depressed melting temperature. The unique properties of DES, including their ability to dissolve a wide range of compounds and their low toxicity, make them an attractive alternative to traditional solvents. This review aims to provide an in-depth examination of the solid-liquid equilibrium of DES, with a focus on the role of hydrogen bonding in modulating their melting temperatures. The effects of various factors, including the composition of the eutectic mixture and the presence of impurities, on the thermodynamic properties of DES are also discussed. By elucidating the underlying mechanisms governing the behavior of DES, this review seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of these promising solvents and their potential applications in various fields, including pharmaceuticals, food processing, and materials science."}
