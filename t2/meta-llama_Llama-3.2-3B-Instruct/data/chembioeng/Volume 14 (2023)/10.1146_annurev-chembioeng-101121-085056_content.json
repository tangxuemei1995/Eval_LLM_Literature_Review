{"Abstract": "This study investigates the evaporation-driven flows and evaporative patterns that emerge during the drying of colloidal dispersions in complex configurations. Using high-speed imaging and computational simulations, we observe the formation of intricate flow networks and morphological changes in the drying drops. The results reveal that the evaporation rate and heat transfer coefficient play crucial roles in shaping the drying dynamics. The findings provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms governing the drying of complex fluids and have implications for various industrial applications, including coating processes and pharmaceutical manufacturing. The study's results also highlight the importance of considering the interplay between evaporation, flow, and morphology in the drying of colloidal dispersions."}
