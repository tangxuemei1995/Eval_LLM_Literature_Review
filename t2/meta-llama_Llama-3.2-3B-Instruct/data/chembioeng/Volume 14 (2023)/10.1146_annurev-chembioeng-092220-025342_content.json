{"Abstract": "This study presents a novel approach to thermodynamic modeling of fluid mixtures by integrating machine learning algorithms with physical knowledge. A hybrid model is developed, combining the strengths of both machine learning and physical models to predict the thermodynamic properties of fluid mixtures. The model is trained on a large dataset of experimental data and physical parameters, allowing it to learn the underlying relationships between the variables. The results show that the hybrid model outperforms traditional physical models in predicting the thermodynamic properties of fluid mixtures, demonstrating the potential of combining machine learning with physical knowledge in thermodynamic modeling."}
