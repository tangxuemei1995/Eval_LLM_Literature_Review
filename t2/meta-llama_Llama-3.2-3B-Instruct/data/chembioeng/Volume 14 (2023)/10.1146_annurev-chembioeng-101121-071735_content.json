{"Abstract": "In situ/operando characterization techniques play a crucial role in elucidating the mechanistic insights of electrochemical CO2 reduction. Advanced characterization methods, such as in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and operando Raman spectroscopy, enable the direct observation of reaction intermediates and catalyst-electrolyte interactions. These techniques provide valuable information on the reduction mechanisms, reaction pathways, and the impact of catalyst and electrolyte properties on CO2 reduction efficiency. By combining these characterization methods, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the electrochemical CO2 reduction process, ultimately informing the development of more efficient and sustainable CO2 reduction catalysts and electrolytes."}
