{"Abstract": "Nonconjugated redox-active polymers have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential applications in energy storage and conversion. These polymers exhibit electron transfer mechanisms that enable efficient charge transport and storage, making them promising candidates for next-generation batteries. This review focuses on the electron transfer kinetics, conductivity, and chemical versatility of nonconjugated redox-active polymers. We discuss the various factors influencing electron transfer, including polymer structure, solvation, and redox couple properties. The review also explores the applications of these polymers in energy storage devices, including batteries and supercapacitors. Furthermore, we examine the chemical modifications and functionalization strategies that can enhance the conductivity and performance of these polymers. By elucidating the underlying mechanisms and potential applications, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of nonconjugated redox-active polymers and their role in the development of sustainable energy storage solutions."}
