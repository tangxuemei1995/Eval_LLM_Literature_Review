{"Abstract": "Active colloids, comprising self-propelled particles suspended in a fluid, have emerged as versatile models, materials, and machines exhibiting unique properties. These non-equilibrium systems, often driven by external stimuli or internal biochemical reactions, can exhibit complex behaviors such as collective motion, phase separation, and pattern formation. By studying active colloids, researchers have gained insights into the fundamental principles governing non-equilibrium thermodynamics, soft matter physics, and biological systems. The design and engineering of active colloids have also led to the development of novel materials with tunable properties, such as self-healing materials and adaptive coatings. Furthermore, active colloids have been explored as potential machines for tasks such as locomotion, sensing, and manipulation, offering a promising approach to the development of autonomous systems. This review provides an overview of the current state of active colloids, highlighting their potential applications and future research directions."}
