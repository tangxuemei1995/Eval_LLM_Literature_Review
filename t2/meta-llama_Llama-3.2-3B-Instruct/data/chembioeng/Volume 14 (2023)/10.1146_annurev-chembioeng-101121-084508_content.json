{"Abstract": "The relentless pursuit of effective pathogen control has led to the development of innovative antibody engineering strategies. By leveraging Fc engineering techniques, researchers have successfully created bispecific antibodies that can simultaneously target and neutralize multiple pathogens, thereby enhancing passive immunization efficacy. Furthermore, the integration of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) has opened new avenues for treating infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This review aims to provide an in-depth examination of the latest advancements in antibody engineering for pathogen control, with a focus on Fc engineering, bispecific antibodies, and ADCs. By exploring the underlying mechanisms and applications of these technologies, this review seeks to elucidate the potential of antibody engineering in outsmarting pathogens and revolutionizing the field of immunotherapy."}
