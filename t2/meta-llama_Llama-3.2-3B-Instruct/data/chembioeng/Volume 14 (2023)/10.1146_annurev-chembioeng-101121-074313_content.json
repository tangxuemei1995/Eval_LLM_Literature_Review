{"Abstract": "This study explores the challenges and strategies for scaling up photochemical reactions from laboratory to industrial production. A comprehensive review of existing literature on photochemistry and photocatalysis reveals the importance of optimizing reaction conditions, catalyst design, and reactor design for efficient and cost-effective production. Flow chemistry techniques are also discussed as a promising approach for scaling up photochemical reactions. The findings highlight the need for a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the technical and economic barriers associated with scaling up photochemical reactions, enabling the transition to large-scale industrial production."}
