{"Abstract": "Systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAIDs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by chronic inflammation, often resulting in debilitating symptoms. Recent advances in genetic research have elucidated the complex interplay between monogenic, digenic, and polygenic factors contributing to SAID pathogenesis. Epigenetic modifications and somatic mutations also play a crucial role in modulating disease susceptibility. This review aims to synthesize the current understanding of SAID genetics, highlighting the key findings from genome-wide association studies, candidate gene analyses, and epigenetic investigations. By integrating these findings, we aim to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the genetic basis of SAIDs and identify potential therapeutic targets for future treatment strategies."}
