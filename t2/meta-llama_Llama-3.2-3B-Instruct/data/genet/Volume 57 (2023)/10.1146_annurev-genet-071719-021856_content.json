{"Abstract": "RNA repair mechanisms are crucial for maintaining genome stability and cellular homeostasis. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of tRNA restriction and splicing in end healing and sealing, processes that involve the coordinated action of multiple enzymes. Polynucleotide kinase-phosphatase (PNK/PAP) complexes play a pivotal role in these reactions, facilitating the repair of damaged RNA molecules. RNA ligase, another essential enzyme, is also involved in end sealing, forming phosphodiester bonds to reconnect broken RNA strands. The discovery of novel tRNA restriction enzymes has expanded our understanding of the complex interplay between these enzymes in RNA repair. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on tRNA restriction, splicing, and end healing, highlighting the latest advances in enzyme discovery and the implications for our understanding of RNA repair mechanisms."}
