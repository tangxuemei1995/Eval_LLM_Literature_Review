{"Abstract": "Single-cell genomics has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity, enabling the characterization of rare cell populations and their contributions to complex traits. By leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing and chromatin accessibility data, researchers can dissect the genetic basis of complex traits, such as height, blood pressure, and disease susceptibility. This approach allows for the identification of rare genetic variants associated with specific cell types, providing new insights into the quantitative genetic architecture of complex traits. Furthermore, the analysis of mutant cells and population genetics data can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying complex traits, ultimately informing the development of novel therapeutic strategies and precision medicine approaches."}
