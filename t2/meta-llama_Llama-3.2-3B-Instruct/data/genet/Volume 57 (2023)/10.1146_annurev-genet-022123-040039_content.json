{"Abstract": "Asymmetric stem cell division is a critical mechanism underlying germline immortality, allowing for the maintenance of a self-renewing population of cells that can perpetuate life indefinitely. Recent studies have highlighted the role of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in regulating asymmetric cell division, with evidence suggesting that rDNA content influences the asymmetric division of stem cells. This process is thought to be mediated by the interaction of rDNA with specific proteins, leading to the preferential division of cells with high rDNA content. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying germline immortality is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to promote healthy aging and extend human lifespan."}
