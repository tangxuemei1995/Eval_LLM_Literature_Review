{"Abstract": "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have revolutionized the field of disease biology by providing a powerful tool for studying human genetics and disease mechanisms in vitro. By reprogramming somatic cells into a pluripotent state, iPSCs can recapitulate the complex gene regulatory networks that govern human development and disease. Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of iPSCs in modeling human diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular disease. Organoid cultures derived from iPSCs have also shown great promise in mimicking the in vivo architecture of human tissues, enabling the study of disease-specific cellular and molecular mechanisms. This abstract reviews the current evidence for the in vitro utility of iPSCs in disease biology and highlights their potential for translational research and therapeutic applications."}
