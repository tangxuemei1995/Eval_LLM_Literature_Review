{"Abstract": "This study explores the potential of CRISPR technology to manipulate the destiny of wild populations through genetic biocontrol. By designing gene drives that utilize homing mechanisms, researchers can suppress or modify population sizes, offering a novel approach to conservation and management. The application of CRISPR enables precise targeting of specific species, reducing unintended consequences and increasing efficacy. Results suggest promising outcomes for population modification."}
