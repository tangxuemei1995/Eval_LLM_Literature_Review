{"Abstract": "Pooled genome-scale CRISPR screens in single cells enable the simultaneous assessment of gene function across the entire genome in individual cells. By leveraging cell sorting and pooled CRISPR libraries, researchers can efficiently screen for functional genomics in single cells, providing unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity and gene regulation. This approach allows for the identification of cell-specific gene dependencies, revealing novel mechanisms of cellular differentiation and response to environmental cues. The use of pooled CRISPR screens in single cells also facilitates the analysis of rare cell populations and the study of gene function in cells with limited availability. By integrating single-cell CRISPR screening with advanced cell sorting and computational analysis, researchers can uncover the complex interplay between gene function and cellular behavior, ultimately advancing our understanding of cellular biology and disease mechanisms."}
