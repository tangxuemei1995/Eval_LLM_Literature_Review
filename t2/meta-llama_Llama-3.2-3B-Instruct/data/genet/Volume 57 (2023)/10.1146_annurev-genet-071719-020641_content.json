{"Abstract": "This study integrates complex life cycles in comparative developmental biology, focusing on the evolution of body plans and developmental modes in diverse animal phyla. A comprehensive analysis of larval and adult stages reveals significant correlations between body plan morphology and developmental mode. The head-trunk axis is identified as a critical factor in shaping the overall body plan, with distinct patterns of morphogenesis observed across phyla. Comparative studies of larval development demonstrate that the transition from larval to adult stages is influenced by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. The findings of this research contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary pressures that have shaped the diversity of animal body plans, highlighting the importance of considering the life cycle as a whole in comparative developmental biology. The results have implications for the development of new theories and models of animal evolution and development."}
