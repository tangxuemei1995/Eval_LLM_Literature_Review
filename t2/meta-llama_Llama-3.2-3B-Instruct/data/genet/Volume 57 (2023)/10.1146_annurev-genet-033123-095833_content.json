{"Abstract": "Programmed cell death (PCD) is a vital process in multicellular organisms, allowing for tissue homeostasis and adaptation to environmental changes. However, the mechanisms underlying PCD in unicellular organisms, such as microbes, remain poorly understood. This review aims to bridge the gap between unicellular and multicellular PCD, highlighting the conserved and divergent features of the two processes. We discuss the regulation of PCD in microorganisms, including the role of stress response pathways, DNA damage response, and cell cycle checkpoints. In contrast to multicellular organisms, unicellular microbes often lack the complex cellular architecture and tissue organization, yet they have evolved unique strategies to control PCD. Our analysis reveals that PCD in unicellular organisms is tightly regulated by a network of molecular mechanisms, including the activation of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes. Understanding the mechanisms of PCD in unicellular organisms has important implications for our understanding of microbial biology and disease, and may also provide insights into the evolution of PCD in multicellular organisms."}
