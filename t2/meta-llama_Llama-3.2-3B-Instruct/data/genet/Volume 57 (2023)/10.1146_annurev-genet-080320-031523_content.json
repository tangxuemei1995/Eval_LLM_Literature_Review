{"Abstract": "Transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs) are a ubiquitous source of genome instability, arising from the concurrent processes of transcription and replication. The replisome, a complex of enzymes responsible for DNA replication, and RNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for transcription, often occupy the same DNA region, leading to conflicts that can result in genomic instability. Origin firing, a process where multiple origins of replication are activated simultaneously, exacerbates TRCs, causing replication stress and DNA damage. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of DNA repair mechanisms in mitigating the effects of TRCs. However, the intricate relationships between TRCs, replisome dynamics, and DNA repair pathways remain poorly understood. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying TRCs and their impact on genome stability, with implications for our understanding of human diseases and cancer."}
