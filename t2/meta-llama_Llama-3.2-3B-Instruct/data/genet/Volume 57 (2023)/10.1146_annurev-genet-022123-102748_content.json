{"Abstract": "Coral reefs, crucial ecosystems providing habitat for a quarter of marine species, are facing unprecedented threats from global change. Climate-driven mass bleaching events and ocean acidification are driving population declines, necessitating an understanding of local adaptation and evolutionary rescue mechanisms. This study employs population genomics to investigate the genetic responses of a coral reef fish species to changing environmental conditions. By analyzing genomic data from populations across a range of environmental gradients, we identify signatures of local adaptation and dispersal patterns. Our results suggest that evolutionary rescue is underway, with populations exhibiting increased genetic diversity and adaptation to changing conditions. These findings have implications for conservation efforts, highlighting the importance of preserving genetic diversity and facilitating dispersal to enhance the resilience of coral reef populations in an age of global change."}
