{"Abstract": "Paramecium, a genus of ciliates, has been a model organism in the fields of genetics, genomics, and evolutionary biology for decades. Recent advances in population genomics have enabled researchers to investigate the genetic and genomic mechanisms underlying the evolution of this organism. This review synthesizes the current state of knowledge on Paramecium genetics, genomics, and evolution, with a focus on gene duplication and genome evolution. We discuss the role of gene duplication in shaping the genome of Paramecium, including the evolution of novel gene functions and the impact on genome size and structure. Additionally, we examine the population genomic approaches used to study the evolutionary dynamics of Paramecium, including the analysis of genetic variation, gene flow, and adaptation. Our review highlights the importance of Paramecium as a model organism for understanding the evolutionary processes that have shaped the genomes of ciliates and other eukaryotic organisms. The findings of this review have implications for our understanding of the evolution of complex traits and the role of gene duplication in shaping the evolution of genomes."}
