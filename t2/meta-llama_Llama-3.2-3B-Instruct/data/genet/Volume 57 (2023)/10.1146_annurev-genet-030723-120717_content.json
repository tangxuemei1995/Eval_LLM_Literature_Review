{"Abstract": "Noncoding regulatory variants, including enhancers, play a crucial role in gene expression and disease susceptibility. Despite their importance, identifying these variants remains a significant challenge. This study employs a multi-faceted approach, integrating genome-wide association studies (GWAS), rare-variant association tests, and machine learning algorithms to uncover noncoding regulatory variants associated with complex diseases. Functional assays validate the identified variants, providing insights into their regulatory mechanisms."}
