{"Abstract": "The interplay between antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and global environmental change is a pressing concern, as the increasing anthropogenic impact on the environment exacerbates the emergence and spread of AMR. Climate change, driven by human activities, alters ecosystems, leading to the disruption of natural antimicrobial processes and the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The contamination of water sources, soil, and air with antibiotics and antimicrobial residues further contributes to the development of AMR. Conversely, the degradation of environmental habitats and the loss of biodiversity can also facilitate the transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes between bacteria. This review synthesizes the current literature on the relationship between AMR and global environmental change, highlighting the need for a holistic approach to address the root causes of AMR and mitigate its consequences. Understanding the complex interactions between AMR and environmental change is crucial for the development of effective strategies to combat this growing public health threat."}
