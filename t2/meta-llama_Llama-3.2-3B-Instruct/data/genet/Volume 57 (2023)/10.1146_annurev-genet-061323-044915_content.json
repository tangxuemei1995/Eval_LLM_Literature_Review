{"Abstract": "Meiosis, a specialized form of cell division, involves intricate processes that facilitate genetic diversity and evolution. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair and undergo recombination, resulting in the exchange of genetic material and increased genetic variation. Crossover interference, a phenomenon where the frequency of recombination decreases with increasing distance between crossover events, plays a crucial role in shaping the genetic landscape. This complex interplay between homologs and recombination events has significant implications for the evolution of species. In contrast to mitosis, meiosis is characterized by its unique features, including the shattering of genetic material and the generation of haploid gametes. Understanding meiosis is essential for comprehending the mechanisms underlying genetic variation and evolution."}
