{"Abstract": "The formation and evolution of vertebrate color patterns are complex processes influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors. Recent studies have elucidated key mechanisms underlying the development of coloration, including the role of melanin-based pigments and the interaction of genetic and hormonal regulators. The evolution of color patterns has been shaped by natural selection, with species adapting to their environments through the development of unique color morphs. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing vertebrate coloration, highlighting the interplay between genetic and environmental factors in the formation and evolution of color patterns. Understanding these mechanisms provides insights into the evolution of animal diversity and the development of novel therapeutic strategies for color-related disorders."}
