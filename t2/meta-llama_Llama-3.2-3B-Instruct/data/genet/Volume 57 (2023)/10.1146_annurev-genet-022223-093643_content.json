{"Abstract": "Microglial transcriptional signatures play a crucial role in maintaining the homeostasis of the central nervous system (CNS). Recent advances in RNA sequencing technologies have enabled the comprehensive characterization of microglial heterogeneity, revealing a complex interplay between different transcriptional profiles. This study aims to unravel the functional significance of microglial transcriptional signatures in the CNS, with a focus on their involvement in health and disease. By integrating transcriptomic data from various CNS disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases and inflammatory conditions, we identified distinct microglial transcriptional signatures associated with specific pathological processes. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying microglial function and dysfunction, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of CNS disorders. Ultimately, this research paves the way for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, leveraging the unique characteristics of microglial transcriptional signatures in the CNS."}
