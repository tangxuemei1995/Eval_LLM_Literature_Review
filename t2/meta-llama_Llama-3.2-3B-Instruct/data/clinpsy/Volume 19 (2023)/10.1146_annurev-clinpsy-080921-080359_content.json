{"Abstract": "This review examines the complex relationship between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and refugees, highlighting the mental health implications of displacement and trauma. A comprehensive analysis of existing literature reveals that refugees are disproportionately affected by PTSD, with symptoms often manifesting as anxiety, depression, and hypervigilance. The review explores the various mechanisms underlying PTSD in refugees, including the impact of prolonged exposure to trauma, social isolation, and cultural adaptation. Current treatment approaches, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and psychopharmacology, are also discussed. The review emphasizes the need for culturally sensitive interventions that address the unique needs of refugee populations. Furthermore, the review highlights the importance of addressing the root causes of displacement and promoting community-based initiatives to prevent PTSD. By synthesizing the existing literature, this review aims to inform evidence-based practice and policy development for refugees with PTSD, ultimately improving mental health outcomes and promoting resilience in this vulnerable population."}
