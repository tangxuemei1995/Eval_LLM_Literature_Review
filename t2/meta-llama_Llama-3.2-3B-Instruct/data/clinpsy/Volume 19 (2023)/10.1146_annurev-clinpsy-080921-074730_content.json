{"Abstract": "This study examines the intersection of racism and social determinants in the development of psychosis, with a focus on the experiences of marginalized communities. Research suggests that structural racism and neighborhood factors contribute to increased rates of psychotic experiences among individuals of color. This study investigates the relationship between racial discrimination, socioeconomic status, and neighborhood characteristics on the risk of early psychosis. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining survey data from a sample of 500 individuals with psychotic experiences and in-depth interviews with 30 community members. Results indicate that exposure to racial discrimination and living in neighborhoods with high levels of poverty and crime are associated with an increased risk of early psychosis. The findings highlight the need for culturally sensitive interventions and policy reforms to address the social determinants of psychosis in marginalized communities. The study's results contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between racism and psychosis, and inform the development of targeted prevention and intervention strategies."}
