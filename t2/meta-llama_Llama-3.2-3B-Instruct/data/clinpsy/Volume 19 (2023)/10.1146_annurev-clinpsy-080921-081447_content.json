{"Abstract": "This review critically examines the intersectional experiences of children with incarcerated parents, highlighting the complex interplay between risk and resilience in their lives. Drawing on a comprehensive literature review, this study reveals that children with incarcerated parents face significant risks, including socioeconomic disadvantage, emotional and psychological distress, and decreased educational attainment. However, it also underscores the resilience of these children, who often develop coping strategies and support networks to navigate these challenges. A critical reframing of the existing literature is necessary to acknowledge the role of intersectionality in shaping the experiences of these children, including the impact of racism, sexism, and classism. Effective interventions must prioritize social justice and address the systemic inequalities that contribute to the overrepresentation of children with incarcerated parents. By reframing the narrative around these children, we can work towards creating a more equitable and supportive environment that fosters resilience and promotes positive outcomes."}
