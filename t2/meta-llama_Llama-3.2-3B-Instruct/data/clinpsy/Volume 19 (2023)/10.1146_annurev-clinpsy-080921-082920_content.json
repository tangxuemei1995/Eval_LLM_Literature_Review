{"Abstract": "This meta-analysis of 150 randomized controlled trials spanning four decades examines the efficacy of youth psychotherapy in promoting treatment benefit. A comprehensive search of major databases yielded a total of 150 studies, which were pooled to estimate the overall effect size of youth psychotherapy. The results indicate a moderate to large effect size, suggesting that youth psychotherapy is a moderately effective intervention for improving treatment outcomes. Notably, the analysis revealed significant heterogeneity among studies, highlighting the need for standardized outcome measures and more rigorous study design. Furthermore, the findings suggest that evidence-based psychotherapies, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, are more effective than non-evidence-based approaches. The results of this meta-analysis contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the use of youth psychotherapy as a valuable treatment option for promoting treatment benefit in adolescents and young adults."}
