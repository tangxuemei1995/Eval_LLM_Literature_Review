{"Abstract": "This study examines the effectiveness of behavioral interventions for children and adults with tic disorder, a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by repetitive motor and vocal movements. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that habit reversal training (HRT), cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and exposure-based therapies have shown promise in reducing tic symptoms. Specifically, HRT has been found to be effective in reducing tic frequency and severity, while CBT has been shown to improve quality of life and reduce anxiety. Exposure-based therapies, including habit reversal training and response prevention, have also demonstrated efficacy in reducing tic symptoms. The findings of this review highlight the importance of behavioral interventions in the management of tic disorder and provide a foundation for future research and treatment development."}
