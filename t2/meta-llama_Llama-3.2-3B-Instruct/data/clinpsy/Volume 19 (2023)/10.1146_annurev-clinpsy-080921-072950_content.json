{"Abstract": "The provision of community mental health services to American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) has long been hampered by the imposition of Western, evidence-based practices that fail to account for the unique cultural, historical, and social contexts of these communities. This disparity is exacerbated by the legacy of colonialism, which has led to intergenerational trauma, cultural erasure, and postcolonial anomie. In response, there is a growing need for Indigenized therapies and community mental health services that prioritize AI/AN epistemologies, worldviews, and healing practices. This special issue seeks to reconcile evidence-based practice with alter-Native psy-ence by showcasing innovative approaches to community mental health services that center AI/AN voices, perspectives, and experiences. Through a critical examination of existing literature and innovative research, this collection aims to advance our understanding of the complex interplay between cultural humility, community engagement, and effective mental health care for AI/AN populations."}
