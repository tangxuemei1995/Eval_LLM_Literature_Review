{"Abstract": "This study examines the developmental consequences of intimate partner violence (IPV) on children, with a focus on prenatal stress and attachment. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining survey data from mothers who experienced IPV during pregnancy with in-depth interviews and observational assessments of child development. Results indicate that children of mothers who experienced prenatal IPV exhibit compromised attachment styles, increased anxiety, and decreased cognitive development. Furthermore, mothers who experienced prenatal IPV reported higher levels of stress and anxiety, which were transmitted to their children through the intergenerational transmission of trauma. The findings suggest that prenatal IPV has a profound impact on child development, highlighting the need for early intervention and support services to mitigate the long-term effects of IPV on children's attachment, emotional, and cognitive development. The study's results have implications for the development of evidence-based interventions to prevent and address the intergenerational transmission of trauma in families affected by IPV."}
