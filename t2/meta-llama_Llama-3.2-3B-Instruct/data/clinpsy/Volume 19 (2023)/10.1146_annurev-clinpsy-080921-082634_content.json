{"Abstract": "The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act is a comprehensive suicide prevention initiative aimed at reducing youth suicide rates in the United States. Established in 2003, the act provides funding for research, education, and service programs focused on preventing adolescent suicide. This review examines the key components and outcomes of the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act, highlighting its impact on youth suicide prevention. A comprehensive literature search was conducted, incorporating peer-reviewed articles, reports, and government documents. The results indicate that the act has contributed significantly to the development of evidence-based suicide prevention programs, increased awareness among mental health professionals, and improved access to services for at-risk youth. However, challenges persist, including limited funding and inconsistent implementation. The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act serves as a model for national suicide prevention efforts, emphasizing the importance of collaborative initiatives and data-driven approaches to addressing this complex public health issue."}
