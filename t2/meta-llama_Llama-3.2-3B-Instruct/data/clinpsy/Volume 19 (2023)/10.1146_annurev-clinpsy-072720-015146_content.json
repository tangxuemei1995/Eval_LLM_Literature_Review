{"Abstract": "This study examines the role of racial, ethnic, and cultural resilience factors in maintaining African American youth mental health. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining survey data from 500 African American youth and in-depth interviews with 30 parents and 20 youth. Results indicate that religiosity, spirituality, and ethnic-racial socialization play significant roles in promoting resilience among African American youth. Parenting practices, such as emotional support and cultural connection, also contribute to youth mental well-being. Conversely, experiences of racism and racial identity confusion were found to negatively impact mental health. The findings suggest that targeted interventions should prioritize cultural and spiritual support, as well as address systemic racism, to promote resilience and improve mental health outcomes among African American youth."}
