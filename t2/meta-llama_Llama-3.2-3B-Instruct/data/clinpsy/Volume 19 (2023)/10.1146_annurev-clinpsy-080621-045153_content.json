{"Abstract": "Psychoneuroimmunology is an interdisciplinary field that explores the intricate communication network between the immune system, brain, and behavior. This field of study reveals that immune responses are not isolated to the body, but rather, they have a profound impact on mental health and well-being. The psychoneuroimmunological framework highlights the complex interplay between psychosocial stress, inflammation, and sickness behavior, which are all linked to the development and maintenance of depression. Recent advances in translational science have enabled researchers to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying immune-to-brain communication, providing new insights into the etiology and treatment of psychiatric disorders. This review aims to provide an introduction to the field of psychoneuroimmunology, highlighting its key concepts, methods, and implications for clinical psychology, with a focus on the translational potential of this emerging field."}
