{"Abstract": "Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is a widely used method for assessing psychological experiences in naturalistic settings. However, concerns regarding the reliability, content validity, and selection bias of EMA have been raised. This study aimed to evaluate the pressing issues in EMA, focusing on the impact of training, missingness, and comparison standards on the validity and reliability of EMA data. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. The results showed that inadequate training of EMA participants and researchers led to significant selection bias and missingness, compromising the validity and reliability of the data. Furthermore, the use of comparison standards without a gold standard reference point resulted in biased comparisons. The findings highlight the need for rigorous training, careful data management, and the establishment of a gold standard reference point to ensure the validity and reliability of EMA data. These results have important implications for the development of EMA as a research method and highlight the need for further methodological refinement."}
