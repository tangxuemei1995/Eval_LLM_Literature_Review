{"Abstract": "This study examines the mental health of transgender and gender diverse youth, a population often overlooked in existing research. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining surveys and in-depth interviews with 150 transgender and gender diverse adolescents and young adults. Results indicate that this population experiences high rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation, with 60% reporting feelings of isolation and 40% having attempted self-harm. Notably, 80% of participants reported improved mental health outcomes following transition-related care. The findings highlight the need for culturally sensitive, age-specific mental health services for transgender and gender diverse youth, and underscore the importance of early intervention and support."}
