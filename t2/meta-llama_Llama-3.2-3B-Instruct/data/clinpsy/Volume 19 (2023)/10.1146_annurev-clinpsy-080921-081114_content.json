{"Abstract": "This study examines the phenomenon of supernatural attributions, where individuals attribute events to divine or malevolent forces, such as God, the Devil, demons, spirits, fate, and karma. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature, this research explores the complex relationships between supernatural beliefs, paranormal experiences, and spiritual struggles. The findings suggest that supernatural attributions serve as a coping mechanism for individuals navigating life's challenges, providing a sense of meaning and control in the face of uncertainty. Furthermore, the study highlights the role of religion and spiritual experiences in shaping supernatural beliefs and attributions. The results have implications for our understanding of the psychological and social factors underlying supernatural beliefs and the ways in which they influence human behavior and well-being. The study contributes to the ongoing debate about the nature of supernatural experiences and their significance in modern society."}
