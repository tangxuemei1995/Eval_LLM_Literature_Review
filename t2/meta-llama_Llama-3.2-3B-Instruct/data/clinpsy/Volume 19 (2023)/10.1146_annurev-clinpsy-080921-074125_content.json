{"Abstract": "Eating disorders among boys and men are a growing concern, with increasing prevalence rates reported in recent years. This disparity in eating disorder diagnosis and treatment has significant implications for the mental and physical health of affected individuals. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that boys and men are less likely to seek help for eating disorders, and when they do, they often receive inadequate treatment. The current epidemiological data suggest that eating disorders among boys and men are associated with a range of negative outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and cardiovascular disease. Effective interventions, such as family-based therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy, have shown promise in reducing symptoms and improving outcomes. However, more research is needed to develop culturally sensitive and effective treatment approaches for this underserved population."}
