{"Abstract": "This study examines the questionable practice of partialing to refine scores on and inferences about measures of psychological constructs. By statistically controlling for residualized variables, researchers often aim to isolate the effects of specific constructs while minimizing the impact of extraneous variables. However, this approach can lead to the suppression of semipartial effects, which are essential for understanding the complex relationships between constructs. The authors argue that partialing can result in biased inferences about construct validity, as it may obscure the presence of residualized variables that can influence the relationships between constructs. The study highlights the need for researchers to critically evaluate the use of partialing and to consider alternative methods that can provide a more nuanced understanding of construct relationships. By doing so, researchers can avoid questionable measurement practice and ensure the accuracy of their inferences about psychological constructs."}
