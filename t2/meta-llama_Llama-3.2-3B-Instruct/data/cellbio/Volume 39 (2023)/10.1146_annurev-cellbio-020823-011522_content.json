{"Abstract": "Morphogens play a crucial role in controlling tissue development by regulating gene expression in a spatially and temporally coordinated manner. Through diffusion-driven signaling, morphogens interact with specific receptors to activate or repress target gene expression, thereby influencing cell fate decisions and tissue patterning. In the context of embryonic development, morphogens such as Wnt, BMP, and FGF have been shown to regulate key developmental processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The complex interplay between morphogens and their receptors in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) underlies the intricate patterns of tissue development, highlighting the importance of morphogen signaling in shaping the embryonic body plan."}
