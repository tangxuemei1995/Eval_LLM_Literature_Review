{"Abstract": "The intricate organization of tissues in multicellular organisms has long been a subject of fascination and inquiry in the field of tissue biology. Recent advances in our understanding of tissue structure and function have highlighted the need for a new paradigm that integrates the complex interplay between cell type, tissue organization, and self-organization. This review aims to explore the current state of knowledge on tissue biology, with a focus on the concept of tissue modules and the relationships between cell types within these modules. We discuss the evolution of tissue organization and the emergence of distinct cell categories, and examine the role of cell relations in shaping tissue function. By synthesizing existing research and identifying key areas of future investigation, this review seeks to contribute to the development of a new paradigm for understanding tissue biology and its implications for our understanding of complex biological systems."}
