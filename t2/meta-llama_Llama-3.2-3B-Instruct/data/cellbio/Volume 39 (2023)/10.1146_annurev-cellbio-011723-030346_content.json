{"Abstract": "The target of rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2) plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes, including cell growth, survival, and metabolism, in yeast. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of TORC2 function and localization in maintaining cellular homeostasis. This complex is composed of two subunits, Tsc2 and Lst7, which are essential for its activity. The plasma membrane (PM) serves as the primary site of TORC2 activity, where it regulates the phosphorylation of downstream targets. Phosphoinositides, specifically phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), are key phospholipids involved in TORC2 localization and function. Endosomes also play a critical role in regulating TORC2 activity, with the complex being transported to and from the PM through endocytic pathways. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of TORC2 function and localization in yeast, with a focus on the regulatory mechanisms that govern its activity and the importance of phosphoinositides and endosomes in maintaining its proper localization and function."}
