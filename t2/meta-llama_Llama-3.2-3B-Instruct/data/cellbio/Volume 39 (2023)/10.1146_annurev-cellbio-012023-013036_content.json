{"Abstract": "The development of the retina is a complex process involving intricate morphogenetic transformations, ultimately giving rise to a highly organized and specialized neural tissue. This review provides an in-depth examination of retinal morphogenesis, from the initial formation of the optic cup to the final lamination of neurons. The optic cup, a precursor structure to the retina, undergoes a series of shape changes and growth patterns, guided by a delicate interplay of cellular and molecular mechanisms. As the optic cup expands and differentiates, neurons begin to migrate and establish their precise positions within the retinal layer. This process is influenced by a range of factors, including cell-cell interactions, growth factors, and transcriptional regulators. The precise lamination of neurons is critical for the proper functioning of the retina, with aberrant patterns of neuronal positioning leading to visual impairments. Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying retinal morphogenesis is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for retinal disorders, including retinal degeneration and visual impairment. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge on retinal morphogenesis, highlighting key regulatory pathways and molecular mechanisms that govern this complex process."}
