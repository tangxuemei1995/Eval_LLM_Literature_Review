{"Abstract": "Tissue morphogenesis is a complex process involving the coordinated interactions between cells and their surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), including the basement membrane. This dynamic interplay of cell adhesion, migration, and ECM remodeling is crucial for the formation and maintenance of tissue structure and function. Recent studies have highlighted the critical roles of integrins and cadherins in mediating cell-ECM interactions, influencing cell shape, motility, and signaling pathways. Interfacial tension, generated by the balance between cell adhesion and ECM stiffness, also plays a key role in regulating tissue morphogenesis. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying tissue morphogenesis, with a focus on the dynamic interactions between cells and the ECM. We discuss the key players involved, including integrins, cadherins, and the ECM components, and explore the implications of these interactions for tissue development and disease."}
