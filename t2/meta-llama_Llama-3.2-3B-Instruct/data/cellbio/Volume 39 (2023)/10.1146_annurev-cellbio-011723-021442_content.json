{"Abstract": "The endometrium, a dynamic and responsive tissue, undergoes significant changes throughout the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. However, aberrant regeneration and fibrosis can lead to conditions such as Asherman syndrome, characterized by intrauterine adhesions and infertility. Recent studies have highlighted the role of stem cells in endometrial regeneration, with evidence suggesting that these cells play a crucial role in maintaining endometrial homeostasis. The mechanisms underlying regeneration and fibrosis in the endometrium are complex and multifaceted, involving the interplay of various cellular and molecular pathways. Understanding these processes is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat endometrial disorders. This review aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge on the mechanisms of regeneration and fibrosis in the endometrium, with a focus on the role of stem cells and the potential implications for the treatment of Asherman syndrome and other endometrial disorders."}
