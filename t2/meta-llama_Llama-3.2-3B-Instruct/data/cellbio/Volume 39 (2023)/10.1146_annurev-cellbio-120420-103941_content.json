{"Abstract": "Cis interactions between membrane receptors and their ligands play a crucial role in regulating cellular signaling pathways. These interactions occur within the same cell membrane compartment and can modulate the receptor's conformation, affinity, and signaling capacity. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of cis interactions in modulating the activity of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, and receptor tyrosine kinases. The mechanisms underlying cis interactions involve changes in receptor-ligand binding affinity, receptor dimerization, and conformational rearrangements. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of cis interactions is essential for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting membrane receptors and ligands. This review aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge on cis interactions, highlighting the key players, mechanisms, and implications for cellular signaling. By exploring the complexities of cis interactions, we can gain insights into the regulation of membrane receptor function and the development of innovative therapeutic approaches."}
