{"Abstract": "The Mexican Tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, has emerged as a valuable model system in cell and developmental biology, particularly in the fields of evolution and developmental biology. This species has undergone significant adaptations to life in cave environments, resulting in the evolution of distinct morphological and physiological traits. Studies utilizing Astyanax mexicanus have elucidated the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying these adaptations, providing insights into the evolutionary processes that shape the development of complex organisms. The cavefish lineage, including Astyanax mexicanus, has also been instrumental in elucidating the role of developmental gene regulatory networks in the evolution of developmental plasticity and the loss of morphological complexity. Furthermore, the use of Astyanax mexicanus has facilitated the discovery of conserved developmental pathways and the identification of novel genes involved in developmental processes, highlighting the species' potential as a model organism for understanding the intricate relationships between evolution, development, and phenotypic plasticity."}
