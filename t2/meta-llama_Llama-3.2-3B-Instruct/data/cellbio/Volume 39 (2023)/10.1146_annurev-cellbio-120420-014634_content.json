{"Abstract": "The RBG motif, a conserved protein domain, has been implicated in various cellular processes, including lipid transport and autophagy. Recent studies have identified bridge-like lipid transport proteins, such as VPS13 and ATG2, that harbor the RBG motif and are involved in the transport of phospholipids and other lipids across cellular membranes. BLTPs, including SHIP164, also contain the RBG motif and have been shown to regulate lipid metabolism. Despite the conservation of the RBG motif across these proteins, the structural and functional mechanisms underlying their lipid transport activities remain poorly understood. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on the structure, functions, and open questions surrounding RBG motif bridge-like lipid transport proteins, highlighting the need for further research to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying their roles in lipid metabolism and autophagy."}
