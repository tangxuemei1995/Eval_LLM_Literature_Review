{"Abstract": "tRNA dysregulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, including autism spectrum disorder, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Aberrant tRNA processing, modification, and splicing can disrupt the translation of essential mRNAs, leading to protein misfolding and aggregation. Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, responsible for charging tRNA with amino acids, can also contribute to disease through the production of aberrant tRNA species. Furthermore, tRNA modifications, such as the incorporation of angiogenin, can modulate the integrated stress response, exacerbating cellular stress and promoting disease progression. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of tRNA dysregulation in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting the complex interplay between tRNA processing, modification, and splicing, and the role of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases and the integrated stress response in disease pathogenesis. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting tRNA dysregulation in these devastating diseases."}
