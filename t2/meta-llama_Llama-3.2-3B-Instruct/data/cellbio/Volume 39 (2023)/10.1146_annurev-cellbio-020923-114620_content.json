{"Abstract": "This study examines the logic of transgenerational inheritance, focusing on the timescales of adaptation. Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) refers to the phenomenon where environmental exposures in one generation influence gene expression in subsequent generations. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we analyze the complex interplay between environmental factors, epigenetic modifications, and phenotypic outcomes. Our analysis reveals that TEI operates on multiple timescales, from short-term adaptations to long-term evolutionary changes. We discuss the implications of TEI for our understanding of adaptation, including the potential for rapid evolution in response to environmental pressures and the role of epigenetic inheritance in shaping phenotypic variation. The findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamics of transgenerational inheritance and its role in shaping the evolution of complex traits."}
