{"Abstract": "The tubulin code refers to the complex interplay of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) on microtubule-associated proteins, specifically tubulin, which plays a crucial role in determining microtubule dynamics, stability, and function. The tubulin code is composed of various PTMs, including detyrosination, tyrosination, acetylation, glutamylation, and glycylation, which can either stabilize or destabilize microtubules. These modifications can be influenced by a range of cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, differentiation, and response to environmental stress. Aberrant tubulin PTMs have been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and infectious diseases. Understanding the tubulin code and its dysregulation is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting microtubule function. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of tubulin PTMs in regulating microtubule dynamics and have provided insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying their dysregulation. Further research is needed to elucidate the functional significance of the tubulin code and its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and promoting disease susceptibility."}
