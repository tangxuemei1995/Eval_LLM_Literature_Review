{"Abstract": "This study employs fluorescence microscopy to investigate the dynamic processes governing mRNA fate in single cells. By tracking mRNAs from transcription to translation and decay, we reveal the intricate relationships between transcription, splicing, localization, and translation. Our results demonstrate the transient nature of mRNA localization and the critical role of RNA decay in regulating gene expression. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying mRNA biology, with implications for our understanding of cellular regulation and disease."}
