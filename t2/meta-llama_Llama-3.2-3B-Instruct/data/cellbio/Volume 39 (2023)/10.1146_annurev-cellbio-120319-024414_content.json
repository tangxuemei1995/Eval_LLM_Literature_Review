{"Abstract": "Reaction diffusion models have been widely employed to explain the emergence of complex patterns in various biological systems, including vertebrate skin color patterning. Despite their simplicity, these models have been found to exhibit surprisingly effective and realistic outcomes, often referred to as the 'unreasonable effectiveness' of reaction diffusion. This phenomenon is exemplified in the sequential patterning of melanocytes and keratinocytes in the skin, where reaction diffusion processes drive the formation of intricate patterns of skin color. By analyzing the interplay between reaction diffusion and cellular automata, we demonstrate that the sequential patterning of skin color can be accurately modeled using phenomenological models. Our results show that the interplay between reaction diffusion and cellular automata gives rise to Turing patterns, which are essential for the emergence of complex patterns in vertebrate skin color patterning. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying skin color patterning and highlight the potential of reaction diffusion models in understanding complex biological systems."}
