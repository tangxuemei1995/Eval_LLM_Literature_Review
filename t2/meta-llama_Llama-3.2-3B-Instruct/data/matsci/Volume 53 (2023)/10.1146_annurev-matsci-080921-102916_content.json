{"Abstract": "The development of electrically controllable materials for soft, bioinspired machines has revolutionized the field of soft robotics, enabling the creation of multifunctional devices with unprecedented flexibility and adaptability. These materials, inspired by nature's own designs, exhibit unique properties such as high elasticity, toughness, and conductivity, allowing for precise control over shape, size, and function. Recent advances in polymer chemistry and nanotechnology have led to the synthesis of novel materials with tailored mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, facilitating the design of soft actuators and robotic components. Bioinspired machines, such as artificial muscles and grippers, have been successfully developed, demonstrating the potential for soft robotics to transform industries from healthcare to manufacturing. This review provides an overview of the current state of electrically controllable materials for soft, bioinspired machines, highlighting their applications, challenges, and future directions for innovation and practical implementation."}
