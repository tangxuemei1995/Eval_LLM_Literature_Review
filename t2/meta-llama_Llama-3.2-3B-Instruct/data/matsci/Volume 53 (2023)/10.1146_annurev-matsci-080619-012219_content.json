{"Abstract": "Ionic gating is a versatile technique employed to modulate the electronic and magnetic properties of transition metal oxides and van der Waals 2D materials. By introducing ions into the material's interstitial space, ionic gating enables the tuning of superconducting, ferromagnetic, and semiconducting states. Recent advancements in neuromorphic computing have highlighted the potential of ionic gated materials for mimicking biological neural networks. In this context, the integration of ionic gating with magnetic thin films has opened up novel avenues for the development of ultra-efficient neuromorphic devices. This review provides an overview of the current state of ionic gating in transition metal oxides and van der Waals 2D materials, with a focus on its applications in magnetic thin films and neuromorphic computing. The potential of ionic gating for tuning electronic and magnetic properties is discussed, along with the challenges and future directions for this rapidly evolving field."}
