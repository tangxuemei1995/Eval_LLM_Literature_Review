{"Abstract": "Grain boundary migration in polycrystals is a complex process that involves the movement of grain boundaries, resulting in changes to the microstructure and properties of the material. This phenomenon is crucial in understanding the evolution of polycrystalline materials under various thermal and mechanical conditions. The migration of grain boundaries can lead to the formation of new grains, grain coarsening, and the creation of defects such as grain boundary misorientations and vacancies. Recent studies have shown that grain boundary migration is influenced by factors such as grain size, temperature, and strain rate. Theoretical models, including grain boundary mobility and diffusion-controlled models, have been developed to describe the grain boundary migration process. Experimental studies have also been conducted to investigate the effects of grain boundary migration on the mechanical properties of polycrystalline materials, including strength, ductility, and toughness. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of grain boundary migration in polycrystals, highlighting the key factors and mechanisms involved in this process."}
