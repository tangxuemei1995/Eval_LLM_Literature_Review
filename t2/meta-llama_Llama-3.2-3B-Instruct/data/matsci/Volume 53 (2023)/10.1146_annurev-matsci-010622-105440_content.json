{"Abstract": "Engineered wood, a rapidly growing field of research, offers a sustainable alternative to traditional wood products. Recent advancements in nanocellulose technology have enabled the development of transparent wood, a material with exceptional mechanical properties and aesthetic appeal. This review highlights the sustainable technologies and applications of engineered wood, with a focus on thermal management. Engineered wood products, such as composite panels and laminated veneer lumber, have been shown to exhibit improved thermal performance and reduced environmental impact. The incorporation of nanocellulose into engineered wood products has also been demonstrated to enhance thermal conductivity and reduce heat transfer. Furthermore, engineered wood's potential for sustainable forestry practices and reduced waste make it an attractive option for the construction industry. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of engineered wood research and its applications in sustainable thermal management."}
