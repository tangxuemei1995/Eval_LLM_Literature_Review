{"Abstract": "The representation of materials is a crucial aspect of machine learning, as it directly impacts the performance of predictive models in materials science. This review article focuses on the recent advancements in feature engineering for materials, with a particular emphasis on the use of generative models to learn complex material representations. We discuss the importance of crystal structure in determining material properties and its role in feature engineering. Our analysis highlights the potential of generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), to learn compact and informative representations of materials. We also explore the application of these models in various materials science tasks, including material classification, property prediction, and material discovery. By integrating insights from materials science and machine learning, we aim to provide a comprehensive framework for the development of more accurate and efficient material representation models."}
