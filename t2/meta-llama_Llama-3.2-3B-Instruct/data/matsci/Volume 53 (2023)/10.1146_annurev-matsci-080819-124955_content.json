{"Abstract": "Hydrous transition metal oxides (HTMOs) have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential applications in electrochemical energy and environmental systems. These materials exhibit unique structural properties, including the incorporation of water molecules, which influence their electrochemical behavior. The insertion of water into the oxide lattice can lead to the formation of hydrated ions, enhancing the material's electrochemical activity. HTMOs have been explored as electrodes in various energy storage and conversion applications, including batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells. The structural water in HTMOs can also be exploited for environmental remediation, such as the removal of heavy metals and pollutants from contaminated water. This review provides an overview of the current state of research on HTMOs, highlighting their electrochemical properties, structural water, and potential applications in energy and environmental systems. The findings of this review aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of HTMOs in addressing the pressing needs of sustainable energy and environmental sustainability."}
