{"Abstract": "This study provides novel insights into plastic localization by crystallographic slip in metallic materials, leveraging emerging experimental and numerical approaches. By combining high-strain rate tensile testing and advanced crystallographic analysis, we elucidate the mechanisms governing slip localization in face-centered cubic (FCC) and body-centered cubic (BCC) alloys. Numerical simulations using finite element methods and crystal plasticity models are also employed to validate experimental findings and predict slip localization in complex geometries. The results demonstrate the critical role of grain boundary characteristics and strain rate sensitivity in controlling plastic localization, with implications for the design of high-performance metallic materials."}
