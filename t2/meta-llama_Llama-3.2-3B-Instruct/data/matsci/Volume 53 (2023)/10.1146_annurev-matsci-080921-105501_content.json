{"Abstract": "Polar metals, a class of ferroelectric materials, have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their unique properties and potential applications. These materials exhibit improper ferroelectricity, a phenomenon where the electric polarization is induced by the spin or orbital degrees of freedom rather than the traditional lattice strain. Perovskites, a class of materials with a general formula of ABO3, are a prominent example of polar metals. The principles underlying the polarization mechanism in polar metals are rooted in the interplay between the crystal structure, electronic properties, and magnetic interactions. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of polar metals, focusing on the theoretical frameworks, experimental techniques, and emerging prospects for their applications in next-generation electronics, optoelectronics, and energy storage devices. The potential of polar metals to revolutionize the field of materials science is discussed, highlighting the need for further research and development to unlock their full potential."}
