{"Abstract": "This study investigates the unique properties of low-dimensional and confined ice, which exhibit distinct morphological and optical characteristics compared to their bulk counterparts. Through a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we characterized the crystal growth and interface morphology of ice in confined geometries, revealing a high degree of anisotropy and interface-mediated effects on its optical and mechanical properties. Our results show that the confined ice exhibits enhanced optical reflectivity and reduced mechanical strength compared to bulk ice, due to the increased surface-to-volume ratio and interface-mediated interactions. Furthermore, we observed a significant impact of the confinement geometry on the ice's morphology, with the formation of novel, low-dimensional structures that display unique optical and mechanical properties. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the behavior of ice in confined environments, such as in cryogenic systems and biological tissues, and may lead to the development of novel materials and applications."}
