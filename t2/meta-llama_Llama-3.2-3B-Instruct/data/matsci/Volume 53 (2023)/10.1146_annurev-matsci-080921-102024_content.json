{"Abstract": "The integration of dynamic in situ electron microscopy with single-atom catalysis has revolutionized our understanding of chemical reactions at the atomic scale. By providing real-time visualizations of catalytic processes, this approach enables researchers to elucidate the intricate mechanisms governing single-atom catalysis. Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of in situ electron microscopy in observing the dynamic behavior of single atoms on surfaces, revealing novel insights into the role of atomic-scale defects and the impact of environmental conditions on catalytic activity. These findings have significant implications for the development of more efficient and selective catalytic systems, with potential applications in fields such as energy production and environmental remediation. The intersection of single-atom catalysis and dynamic in situ electron microscopy has opened a new frontier in chemical research, offering a powerful tool for probing the intricate dynamics of catalytic processes at the atomic scale."}
