{"Abstract": "Noncentrosymmetric materials have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their unique properties, including nonlinear optical responses, magnetism, and topological protection. These materials exhibit skyrmion behavior, which is a topological phenomenon that arises from the interplay between spin and orbital angular momentum. The electronic structure of noncentrosymmetric materials is crucial in understanding their properties, as it determines the arrangement of electrons and the resulting physical phenomena. This review article provides an overview of the design principles for noncentrosymmetric materials, with a focus on their electronic structure and the resulting nonlinear optical responses, magnetic properties, and topological protection. We discuss the role of crystal symmetry, electron-electron interactions, and lattice distortions in shaping the electronic structure and properties of these materials. Our analysis highlights the potential of noncentrosymmetric materials for novel applications in optoelectronics, spintronics, and topological quantum computing. By understanding the design principles for these materials, we can unlock their full potential and explore new frontiers in materials science and physics."}
