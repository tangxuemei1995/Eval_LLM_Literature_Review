{"Abstract": "The development of tailor-made additives for melt-grown molecular crystals has garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential to control crystal morphology, chirality, and polarity. Melt-grown crystals, such as spherulites and twisted crystals, exhibit unique properties that make them suitable for various applications, including optoelectronics and pharmaceuticals. However, the lack of control over crystal structure and defects can lead to inconsistent material properties. Tailor-made additives, such as chiral molecules and polymers, have been shown to influence crystal growth and morphology, enabling the creation of crystals with desired properties. This review aims to discuss the current state of research on tailor-made additives for melt-grown molecular crystals, highlighting their potential benefits and limitations. The role of additives in controlling crystal chirality, polarity, and morphology is examined, as well as the challenges associated with their incorporation into melt-grown crystal systems. By understanding the complex interactions between additives and crystal growth, researchers can develop more efficient methods for creating tailor-made molecular crystals with tailored properties."}
