{"Abstract": "Quantitative Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) has revolutionized the field of materials science by enabling the acquisition of high-resolution images, diffraction patterns, spectroscopic information, and 3D tomographic reconstructions of materials at the nanoscale. By leveraging advanced computational models and machine learning algorithms, STEM can provide quantitative analysis of material properties, such as composition, crystal structure, and defects. This abstract reviews the current state of the art in quantitative STEM, highlighting its applications in materials characterization, simulation, and modeling. The integration of STEM with other analytical techniques, such as electron energy loss spectroscopy and electron backscatter diffraction, has expanded its capabilities for materials analysis. The future of quantitative STEM holds great promise for advancing our understanding of materials science and driving innovation in fields such as energy, electronics, and biomedicine."}
