{"Abstract": "The increasing demand for sustainable materials has driven research into the development of polymers derived from biological matter. Biopolymers, such as polylactic acid (PLA) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional petrochemical-based polymers. These biopolymers offer a sustainable solution for various applications, including packaging, textiles, and biomedical devices. Biocomposites, comprising biopolymers and natural fibers, have also been explored for their enhanced mechanical properties and reduced environmental impact. Furthermore, the use of biological matter in cementitious materials has been investigated, providing a sustainable alternative to traditional cement production. This review highlights the progress made in the development of sustainable polymers from biological matter, emphasizing the potential of biopolymers and biocomposites in reducing the environmental footprint of various industries. The future directions of this field are also discussed, including the scaling up of bioproduction processes and the integration of biopolymers into existing supply chains."}
