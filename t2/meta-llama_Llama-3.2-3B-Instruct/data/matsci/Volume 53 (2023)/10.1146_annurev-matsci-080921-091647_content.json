{"Abstract": "Extreme abnormal grain growth (EAGG) is a phenomenon where grains exhibit accelerated growth rates, leading to the formation of a coarse-grained microstructure. This process is often driven by the interplay between grain boundary energy, mobility, and Zener pinning. In this review, we synthesize the current understanding of EAGG mechanisms, highlighting the critical roles of grain boundary energy and mobility in governing grain growth rates. We also discuss the impact of Zener pinning on grain growth, including its ability to suppress or enhance grain growth depending on the pinning strength and grain boundary characteristics. Furthermore, we examine the microstructural outcomes of EAGG, including the formation of grain size distributions, texture evolution, and the resulting mechanical properties. By connecting the dots between EAGG mechanisms and microstructural outcomes, we aim to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and predicting the behavior of materials undergoing extreme abnormal grain growth."}
