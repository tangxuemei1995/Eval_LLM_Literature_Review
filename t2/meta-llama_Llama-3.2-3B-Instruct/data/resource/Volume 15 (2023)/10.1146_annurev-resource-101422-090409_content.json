{"Abstract": "Food insecurity remains a pervasive issue in the United States, affecting millions of individuals, particularly vulnerable populations such as women, infants, and children. This study examines the measurement of food insecurity, economic modeling of its causes and consequences, and the effectiveness of food assistance programs in addressing this issue. Using a comprehensive review of existing literature and data from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), School Breakfast Program (SBP), and National School Lunch Program (NSLP), we analyze the relationships between food insecurity, poverty, and economic instability. Our findings suggest that food insecurity is closely linked to poverty and economic instability, with certain demographic groups, such as women and children, being disproportionately affected. We also evaluate the effectiveness of food assistance programs in reducing food insecurity, with mixed results. Our study highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of food insecurity and its causes, as well as the importance of targeted interventions to address this issue. By providing a comprehensive framework for understanding food insecurity and its economic implications, this research contributes to the development of effective policies and programs to address this pressing social issue."}
