{"Abstract": "Food fraud, encompassing adulteration and mislabeling, poses significant threats to consumer trust and public health. Asymmetric information between buyers and sellers creates an environment conducive to fraudulent activities. Credence goods, such as organic and fair-trade products, are particularly vulnerable to mislabeling. Effective deterrence strategies require costly and imperfect enforcement mechanisms, including certification schemes and regular inspections. This review synthesizes existing literature on food fraud, highlighting the need for a multi-faceted approach that balances regulatory efforts with consumer education and market incentives to prevent and detect food adulteration and mislabeling."}
