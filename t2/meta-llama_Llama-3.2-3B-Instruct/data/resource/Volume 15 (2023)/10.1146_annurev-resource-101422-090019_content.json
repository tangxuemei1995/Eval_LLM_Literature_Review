{"Abstract": "This study examines the economics of crop residue management, focusing on the environmental and climate change implications for smallholder farmers. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining econometric analysis with case studies of crop residue burning and technology adoption. The results show that crop residue burning, a common practice in developing countries, has significant environmental costs, including greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. In contrast, adopting technology-based residue management practices, such as mechanical harvesting and anaerobic digestion, can reduce these costs and generate additional income streams for farmers. The study highlights the need for policy interventions that support the adoption of sustainable residue management practices among smallholder farmers, and provides recommendations for future research and policy development."}
