{"Abstract": "This study synthesizes advances in causal inference to investigate the complex relationships between air pollution and health outcomes. By leveraging natural experiments and integrated science assessments, we examine the causal effects of particulate matter and ozone on cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Our analysis incorporates machine learning algorithms to account for confounding variables and selection bias. The results suggest that exposure to high levels of air pollution is associated with increased risk of adverse health outcomes, particularly among vulnerable populations. These findings have significant implications for policy-making and public health interventions aimed at mitigating the health impacts of air pollution."}
