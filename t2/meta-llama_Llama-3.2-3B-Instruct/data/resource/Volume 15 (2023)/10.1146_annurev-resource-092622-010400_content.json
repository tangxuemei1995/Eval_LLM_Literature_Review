{"Abstract": "This study examines the intersection of competition policy and environmental sustainability, exploring the role of cooperation and firm green preferences in shaping the competitive landscape. Through a comprehensive analysis of antitrust regulations and sustainability agreements, we investigate how firms engage in cooperative behavior to reduce environmental impacts while maintaining competitive pressures. Our findings suggest that cooperation can lead to more sustainable outcomes, but also raise concerns about potential anticompetitive effects. We discuss the implications of these trade-offs for competition policy and propose a framework for evaluating the sustainability benefits of cooperation in the context of environmental regulations. The results have significant implications for industrial organization theory and policy-making in the context of climate change and sustainable development."}
