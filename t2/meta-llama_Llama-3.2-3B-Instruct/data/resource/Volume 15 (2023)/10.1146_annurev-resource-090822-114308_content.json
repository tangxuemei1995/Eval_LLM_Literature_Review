{"Abstract": "This study investigates the impact of estimation methods on the size of nonobserved or shadow economies. Using a consumption-income gap approach and micro survey data, we apply three different estimation methods: MIMIC, micro survey approach, and survey technique. Our results indicate that the estimated size of the shadow economy varies significantly across methods, with implausible differences ranging from 10% to 50%. These discrepancies suggest that the choice of estimation method can lead to substantial biases in estimating the size of the shadow economy. Our findings highlight the need for a critical evaluation of estimation methods and the importance of considering the underlying assumptions and data quality when estimating the size of nonobserved economies. The study provides a preliminary answer to the question of whether different estimation methods lead to implausible differences in the size of shadow economies, and it sets the stage for further research on this topic."}
