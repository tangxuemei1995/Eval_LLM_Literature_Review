{"Abstract": "The economics of nutrient pollution from agriculture is a pressing concern worldwide, with significant environmental and health implications. Nonpoint-source pollution, resulting from the overapplication of fertilizers and other agricultural inputs, has become a major contributor to eutrophication and water quality degradation. This study examines the economic drivers and consequences of nutrient pollution from agriculture, with a focus on the environmental externalities associated with fertilizer overapplication. Using a combination of econometric and environmental modeling approaches, we analyze the impact of fertilizer prices, crop yields, and agricultural subsidies on nutrient pollution. Our results indicate that the economic benefits of increased crop yields and lower fertilizer prices often outweigh the environmental costs of nutrient pollution, leading to overapplication and subsequent environmental degradation. The study highlights the need for policy interventions, such as pricing mechanisms and subsidies for best management practices, to mitigate the economic and environmental consequences of nutrient pollution from agriculture. By addressing the economic drivers of nutrient pollution, we can develop more effective strategies for reducing environmental externalities and promoting sustainable agricultural practices."}
