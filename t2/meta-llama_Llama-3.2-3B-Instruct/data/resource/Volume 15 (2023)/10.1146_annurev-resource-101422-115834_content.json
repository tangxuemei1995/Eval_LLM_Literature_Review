{"Abstract": "This study examines the impact of environmental regulation on labor demand, drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature. The evidence suggests that environmental regulations can lead to increased labor demand in certain industries, particularly those with high environmental stakes. Conversely, regulations that impose significant costs on firms can result in reduced labor demand. The findings highlight the complex relationship between environmental regulation and labor markets, emphasizing the need for policymakers to consider the potential labor market implications of environmental policies. The study's results have implications for understanding the distributional effects of environmental regulation and informing evidence-based policy decisions."}
