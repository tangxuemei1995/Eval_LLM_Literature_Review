{"Abstract": "This critical review examines the Market Stability Reserve (MSR) in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), a key stability mechanism designed to mitigate market volatility. The review assesses the MSR's effectiveness in addressing overlapping policies and its implications for climate policy. It discusses the reserve's operation, its impact on emissions trading, and the need for further refinement to ensure the EU ETS remains a robust and effective climate policy tool."}
