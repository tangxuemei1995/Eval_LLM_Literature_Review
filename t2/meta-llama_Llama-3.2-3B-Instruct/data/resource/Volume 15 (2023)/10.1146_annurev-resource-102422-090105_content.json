{"Abstract": "Agroecology, a holistic approach to agriculture that prioritizes ecological interactions and social equity, offers a promising framework for achieving a sustainable agriculture and food system. This concept has been increasingly recognized as a key strategy for mitigating climate change, conserving biodiversity, and ensuring food security. By integrating local knowledge, multiple scales, and multiactor approaches, agroecology can facilitate agricultural transformation and promote the adoption of sustainable practices. Emerging technologies, such as precision agriculture and digital extension services, can also support the scaling up of agroecological solutions. However, the successful implementation of agroecology requires a comprehensive policy framework that addresses the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of the food system. This includes the development of supportive agricultural and food policies that incentivize the adoption of agroecological practices and promote the resilience of local food systems. By exploring the intersection of agroecology, policy, and technology, this research aims to contribute to the development of effective strategies for large-scale adoption of sustainable agriculture and food systems."}
