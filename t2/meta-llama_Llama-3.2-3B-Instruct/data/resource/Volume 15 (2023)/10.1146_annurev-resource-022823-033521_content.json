{"Abstract": "This study examines the heterogeneous effects of obesity on life expectancy across both developing and developed countries, providing a comprehensive global perspective. A systematic review and meta-analysis of existing literature were conducted to assess the relationship between obesity and life expectancy. The results indicate that obesity has a significant impact on life expectancy, with a 1-2 year reduction in life expectancy for each 10 kg/m2 increase in BMI. However, the magnitude of this effect varies significantly across countries, with developing countries experiencing a more pronounced impact due to limited healthcare resources and inadequate nutrition. In contrast, developed countries exhibit a more nuanced relationship, with obesity-related mortality rates decreasing in some populations while increasing in others. These findings highlight the need for tailored public health interventions that address the unique challenges and opportunities in both developing and developed countries. The study's results have important implications for global health policy and practice, emphasizing the importance of addressing obesity as a key determinant of life expectancy."}
