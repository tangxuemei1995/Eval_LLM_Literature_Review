{"Abstract": "This study examines the economics of ecosystem restoration, focusing on the socioeconomic impacts of restoring degraded ecosystems on biodiversity and environmental policies. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that ecosystem restoration can have significant economic benefits, including increased ecosystem services, improved human health, and enhanced biodiversity. However, the costs of restoration can be substantial, and the effectiveness of restoration efforts can be influenced by environmental policies and socioeconomic factors. This study analyzes the trade-offs between restoration costs and benefits, and explores the role of policy interventions in promoting sustainable ecosystem restoration. The findings suggest that targeted policy interventions, such as payment for ecosystem services and green infrastructure investments, can help to optimize the economic efficiency of ecosystem restoration efforts. The study's results have implications for environmental policymakers and practitioners seeking to balance economic development with environmental conservation and biodiversity protection."}
