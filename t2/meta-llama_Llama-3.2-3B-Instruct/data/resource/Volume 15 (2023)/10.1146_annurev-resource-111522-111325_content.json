{"Abstract": "The implementation of sugar-sweetened beverage taxes has been a cornerstone of public health policy aimed at reducing the consumption of unhealthy drinks and mitigating the burden of chronic noncommunicable diseases (CNDs) such as obesity. Since their introduction, numerous studies have evaluated the effectiveness of these taxes in achieving policy goals. While some jurisdictions have reported significant declines in sales and consumption of taxed beverages, others have experienced limited or no impact. This review synthesizes evidence from a range of countries and contexts to assess the current state of sugar-sweetened beverage tax policy and its outcomes. We examine the design and implementation of taxes, as well as the resulting changes in consumption patterns and CND prevalence. Our analysis highlights areas for improvement, including the need for more effective tax design, increased transparency, and enhanced monitoring and evaluation. Ultimately, this review aims to inform the development of more effective policies to promote healthier diets and reduce the burden of CNDs."}
