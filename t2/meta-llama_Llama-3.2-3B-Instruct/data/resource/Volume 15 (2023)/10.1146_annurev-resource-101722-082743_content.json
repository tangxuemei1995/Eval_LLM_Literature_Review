{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of behavioral economics and neuroeconomics to understand the underlying mechanisms driving individual decision-making regarding environmental values. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that behavioral economics and neuroeconomics offer valuable insights into the cognitive biases and neural processes influencing human choices related to environmental conservation. The findings suggest that individuals' perceptions of environmental values are shaped by a complex interplay of factors, including personal experiences, social norms, and cognitive heuristics. Neuroimaging studies have shown that environmental decisions are associated with activation in brain regions involved in emotion, motivation, and decision-making. The study highlights the importance of considering these factors in the development of effective policies for managing common pool resources, such as forests and fisheries. By integrating behavioral economics and neuroeconomics, policymakers can design more effective strategies to promote sustainable environmental practices and mitigate the impacts of human activities on the environment."}
