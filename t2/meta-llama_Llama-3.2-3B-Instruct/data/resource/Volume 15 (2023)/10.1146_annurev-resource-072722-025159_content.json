{"Abstract": "Food losses in agrifood systems are a pervasive issue, resulting in significant economic and nutritional burdens. This phenomenon encompasses post-harvest losses, processing and distribution losses, and retail and consumer losses. The determinants of food loss are multifaceted, involving factors such as infrastructure, storage, transportation, and consumer behavior. Understanding the measurement and characterization of food loss is crucial for developing effective interventions. Research has identified various value chain interventions, including improved storage facilities, enhanced logistics, and consumer education programs, as potential solutions to mitigate food loss. However, the effectiveness of these interventions varies across different contexts and value chains. This review synthesizes existing literature on food loss in agrifood systems, highlighting the current state of knowledge on measurement, determinants, and interventions. The findings have implications for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers seeking to address this pressing global issue and ensure food security."}
