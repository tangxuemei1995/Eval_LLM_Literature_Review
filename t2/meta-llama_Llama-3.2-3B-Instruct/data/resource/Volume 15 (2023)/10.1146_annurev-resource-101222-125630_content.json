{"Abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between temperature and labor productivity, focusing on the distributional effects of early-life exposure to varying temperatures on mental productivity. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that temperature can significantly impact cognitive function, with optimal temperatures ranging between 22-25Â°C. However, early-life exposure to extreme temperatures can lead to long-term adaptations, influencing labor productivity. The findings suggest that temperature distributional effects may be a critical factor in understanding the relationship between temperature and labor productivity."}
