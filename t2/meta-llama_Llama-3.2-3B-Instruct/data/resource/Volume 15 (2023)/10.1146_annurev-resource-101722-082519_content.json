{"Abstract": "The Rigor Revolution: New Standards of Evidence for Impact Assessment of International Agricultural Research\n\nThis study introduces a paradigm shift in the impact assessment of international agricultural research, emphasizing the need for rigorous standards of evidence. Building on existing frameworks, we propose a novel approach that integrates causal analysis, scale, and measurement to evaluate the effectiveness of agricultural research for development (ARD) initiatives. Our framework, grounded in a systematic review of 150 impact assessment studies, identifies key methodological limitations and proposes a set of evidence-based standards for ARD impact assessment. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework through a case study of a large-scale agricultural intervention, highlighting the importance of causal inference, scale, and measurement in assessing impact. Our findings have significant implications for the design and evaluation of ARD programs, promoting more informed decision-making and improved resource allocation. By adopting rigorous standards of evidence, the agricultural research community can enhance the impact of its work and contribute more effectively to global development goals."}
