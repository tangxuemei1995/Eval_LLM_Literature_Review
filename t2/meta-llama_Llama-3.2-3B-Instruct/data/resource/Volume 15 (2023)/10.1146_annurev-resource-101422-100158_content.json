{"Abstract": "This study examines the impact of social protection programs on rural transformation in Africa, focusing on cash transfer schemes as a key mechanism for improving household income and agricultural production. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining quantitative impact evaluation with qualitative case studies in three African countries. The results show that cash transfer programs significantly increased household income and improved food security, leading to increased investment in agriculture and rural infrastructure. However, the impact of these programs on rural transformation was limited by factors such as corruption, inadequate institutional capacity, and limited access to markets. The study highlights the need for policymakers to address these challenges and ensure that social protection programs are designed and implemented in a way that promotes sustainable rural development and poverty reduction. The findings have implications for policy makers and practitioners seeking to leverage social protection programs to drive rural transformation in Africa."}
