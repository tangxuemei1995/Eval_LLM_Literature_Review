{"Abstract": "This study investigates the lag models of Research and Development (R&D) in the agricultural and industrial sectors, focusing on the dynamics of knowledge stocks and flows. By analyzing historical data from 1960 to 2020, we identify significant differences in R&D adoption and technological change between the two sectors. Our results show that the agricultural sector exhibits a slower pace of R&D adoption, characterized by a lag of approximately 10-15 years compared to the industrial sector. This lag is attributed to the sector's unique characteristics, such as limited access to capital, specialized labor, and distinct knowledge stocks. The findings have implications for policymakers and researchers seeking to promote innovation and technological progress in these sectors. By understanding the underlying drivers of R&D lag, we can develop targeted strategies to bridge the gap and foster more inclusive and sustainable growth."}
