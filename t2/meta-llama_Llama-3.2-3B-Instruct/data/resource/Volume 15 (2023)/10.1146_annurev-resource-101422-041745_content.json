{"Abstract": "Mathematical programming has emerged as a crucial tool in analyzing the complex interactions between agricultural, natural resource, and climate change. This interdisciplinary approach enables researchers to model and optimize decision-making processes under uncertainty, allowing for the development of effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. By incorporating climate change projections and economic constraints, mathematical programming models can identify optimal management practices, such as crop diversification and renewable energy investments, that minimize environmental impacts while ensuring food security and sustainable development. This abstract reviews the current state of mathematical programming applications in climate change analysis, highlighting its potential to inform policy decisions and support the transition towards a more resilient and sustainable future. The discussion emphasizes the need for further research and collaboration between mathematicians, economists, and environmental scientists to fully harness the power of mathematical programming in addressing the pressing challenges of climate change."}
