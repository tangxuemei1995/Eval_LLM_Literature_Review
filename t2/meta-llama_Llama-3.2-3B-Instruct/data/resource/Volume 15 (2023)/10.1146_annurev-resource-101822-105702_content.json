{"Abstract": "Climate change poses significant risks to the financial sector, manifesting through increased frequency and severity of natural disasters, which can disrupt financial markets and institutions. This review examines the financial sector impacts of risks associated with climate change, with a focus on natural disasters, banking, insurance, and financial markets. The literature reveals that climate-related disasters can lead to losses in financial assets, damage to infrastructure, and increased costs for insurance companies. The financial sector's vulnerability to climate-related risks is exacerbated by its interconnectedness with other sectors, such as agriculture and energy. The review highlights the need for financial institutions to adopt climate-resilient strategies, including risk management, diversification, and investment in climate change mitigation and adaptation initiatives. Furthermore, policymakers and regulators must develop and implement effective climate risk governance frameworks to ensure the financial sector's resilience in the face of climate-related disruptions. Ultimately, this review underscores the imperative for the financial sector to prioritize climate risk management and mitigation to maintain financial stability and support sustainable development."}
