{"Abstract": "Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as a critical mechanism underlying the formation of biomolecular condensates in various cellular processes, including cancer. Fusion oncoproteins, such as MUM1 and MUM2, are known to drive the formation of LLPS condensates that regulate transcription and signaling pathways. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in the formation and function of these condensates. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the role of phase-separated condensates in fusion oncoprotein-driven cancers, with a focus on the sequence features and IDRs that govern their formation and function. We discuss the implications of LLPS condensates in cancer progression, including their impact on transcriptional regulation, signaling, and therapeutic targeting. The review also highlights the need for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying LLPS condensates in cancer and their potential as therapeutic targets."}
