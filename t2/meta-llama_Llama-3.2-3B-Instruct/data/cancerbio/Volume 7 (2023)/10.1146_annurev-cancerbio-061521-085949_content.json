{"Abstract": "Macrophages and dendritic cells play pivotal roles in the tumor microenvironment, modulating immune responses and influencing cancer progression. These mononuclear phagocytes can either promote or suppress tumor growth, depending on their polarization state and the presence of specific signals. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of targeting macrophages and dendritic cells as a therapeutic strategy in cancer treatment. By modulating the function of these cells, therapies can enhance anti-tumor immune responses, inhibit tumor angiogenesis, and suppress metastasis. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the biology of macrophages and dendritic cells in cancer, and discuss the therapeutic modulation of these cells as a promising approach for cancer immunotherapy. The potential applications and limitations of this approach are also discussed, highlighting the need for further research in this area."}
