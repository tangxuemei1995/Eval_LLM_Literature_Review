{"Abstract": "The estrogen receptor (ER) plays a crucial role in the development and progression of breast cancer, with approximately 70-80% of ER-positive cases exhibiting tumor growth in response to estrogen. To combat this, next-generation estrogen receptor-targeted therapeutics have emerged as a promising approach. Selective ER modulators (SERMs) and selective ER degraders (SERDs) have shown significant potential in selectively inhibiting or degrading ER activity, thereby reducing tumor growth and promoting patient outcomes. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of ER-targeted therapeutics, highlighting the latest advances in SERM and SERD development, as well as their mechanisms of action, efficacy, and clinical implications. By exploring the latest research and clinical findings, this review seeks to inform the development of future ER-targeted therapies and ultimately improve treatment options for ER-positive breast cancer patients."}
