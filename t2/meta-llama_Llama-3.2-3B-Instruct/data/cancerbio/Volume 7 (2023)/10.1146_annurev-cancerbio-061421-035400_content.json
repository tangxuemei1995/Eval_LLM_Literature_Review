{"Abstract": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a pivotal role in the tumor microenvironment of pancreatic cancer, contributing to the development and progression of the disease. Desmoplasia, a characteristic feature of pancreatic tumors, is largely composed of CAFs that secrete various growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix proteins, creating a hostile environment for anti-tumor immune responses. The heterogeneity of pancreatic cancer is further exacerbated by the diverse population of CAFs, which can be classified into distinct subtypes based on their gene expression profiles and functional characteristics. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of CAFs in modulating tumor heterogeneity, promoting resistance to chemotherapy, and facilitating metastasis. Understanding the complex interactions between CAFs and pancreatic cancer cells is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on CAFs in pancreatic cancer, with a focus on their role in tumor microenvironment, desmoplasia, and tumor heterogeneity, and to discuss the potential implications for cancer therapy. By elucidating the mechanisms by which CAFs contribute to pancreatic cancer progression, this review seeks to provide insights into the development of innovative therapeutic approaches targeting CAFs in the treatment of pancreatic cancer."}
