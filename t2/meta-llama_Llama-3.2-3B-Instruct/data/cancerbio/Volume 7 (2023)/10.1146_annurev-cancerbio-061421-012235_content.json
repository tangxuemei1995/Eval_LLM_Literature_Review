{"Abstract": "CAR T cell therapies have revolutionized the treatment of various hematological malignancies by harnessing the power of adoptive T cell immunotherapy. However, the emergence of resistance to CAR T cells poses a significant challenge to the long-term efficacy of these treatments. Intrinsic resistance mechanisms, such as genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations, can render CAR T cells ineffective against tumor cells. Extrinsic resistance mechanisms, including immune suppression and tumor microenvironment-mediated immune evasion, can also hinder the therapeutic effects of CAR T cells. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying resistance to CAR T cell therapies, with a focus on intrinsic and extrinsic resistance mechanisms. By elucidating the complex interactions between CAR T cells and the tumor microenvironment, this review seeks to identify potential therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance and improve the clinical outcomes of CAR T cell therapies."}
