{"Abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) natural killer (NK) cells represent a promising approach in cancer immunotherapy, offering a potent and flexible tool for targeting and eliminating malignant cells. By integrating CAR technology with NK cells, researchers have created a novel class of cell therapies that can be manufactured in large quantities, making them ideal for off-the-shelf products. These CAR NK cells have demonstrated impressive antitumor efficacy in preclinical models, exhibiting enhanced killing capabilities against a range of cancer types. Ongoing clinical trials are investigating the safety and efficacy of CAR NK cells in humans, with encouraging results. The future of cancer treatment may indeed be 'now', with CAR NK cells poised to revolutionize the field of immunotherapy."}
