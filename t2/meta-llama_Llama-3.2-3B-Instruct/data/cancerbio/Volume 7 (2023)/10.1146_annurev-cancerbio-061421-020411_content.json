{"Abstract": "The increasing complexity of cancer treatment necessitates the exploration of combination therapies to enhance efficacy and minimize toxicity. This review examines the rationales underlying the combination of therapies, including independent action, response correlation, and collateral sensitivity versus synergy. Specifically, we focus on the role of PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors in combination with other treatments. Our analysis reveals that combination therapies can exploit the independent actions of individual agents, while also leveraging response correlation and collateral sensitivity to enhance therapeutic outcomes. However, the potential for synergy must be carefully balanced against the risk of collateral sensitivity, which can lead to adverse effects. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of combination therapies, including the use of PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors in conjunction with other treatments. By understanding the underlying mechanisms and rationales, clinicians can optimize combination therapies to improve patient outcomes and reduce treatment-related toxicity."}
