{"Abstract": "This study investigates novel strategies for heating up cold tumors to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors. By modulating the tumor microenvironment, these approaches aim to increase the expression of tumor antigens and activate immune cells. Preclinical models demonstrate improved therapeutic outcomes following the application of targeted heating techniques, such as radiofrequency ablation and photothermal therapy. These findings have significant implications for the clinical trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors, suggesting potential synergies between tumor heating and immunotherapy."}
