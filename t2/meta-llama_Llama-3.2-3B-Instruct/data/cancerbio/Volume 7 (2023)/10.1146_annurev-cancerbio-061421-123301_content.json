{"Abstract": "The dynamic nature of cancer progression necessitates the development of innovative tools for lineage tracing in vivo. Recent advances in single-cell analysis and cell barcoding have enabled researchers to dissect the complex heterogeneity of tumors, elucidating the intricate relationships between cancer cells and their microenvironment. This study leverages these cutting-edge technologies to investigate the evolution of cancer lineages in vivo, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying tumor heterogeneity and metastasis. By employing a novel, high-throughput cell barcoding strategy, we have successfully tracked the clonal expansion and dissemination of cancer cells in a mouse model of breast cancer. Our findings provide new insights into the dynamics of tumor evolution and have significant implications for the development of targeted therapies and personalized cancer treatment strategies."}
