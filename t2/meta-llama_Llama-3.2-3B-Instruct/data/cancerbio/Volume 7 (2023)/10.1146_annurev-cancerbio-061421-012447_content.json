{"Abstract": "Somatic mutations in normal tissues have long been recognized as a critical step in the development of cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying early carcinogenesis remain poorly understood. Recent studies have highlighted the role of stem cells in maintaining tissue homeostasis and their susceptibility to mutagenic stress. As cells age, the accumulation of mutations in stem cells can lead to the acquisition of oncogenic properties. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of somatic mutations in normal tissues, with a focus on the interplay between aging, stem cells, and carcinogenesis. We discuss the impact of carcinogens on stem cells and the potential for cancer prevention strategies targeting these cells. By integrating insights from stem cell biology, aging, and cancer genetics, this review seeks to shed new light on the early stages of carcinogenesis and identify promising avenues for cancer prevention and intervention."}
