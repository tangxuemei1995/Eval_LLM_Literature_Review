{"Abstract": "Clonal heterogeneity within a tumor refers to the coexistence of distinct subpopulations of cancer cells with varying genetic and epigenetic profiles. This phenomenon significantly impacts cancer immunosurveillance, the body's ability to recognize and eliminate cancer cells. Research has shown that intratumor heterogeneity can lead to the development of immune-escape mechanisms, allowing cancer cells to evade immune checkpoint inhibitors and other immunotherapies. This study investigates the relationship between clonal heterogeneity and cancer immunosurveillance, highlighting the importance of considering tumor heterogeneity in the design and implementation of immunotherapies. The findings suggest that targeting heterogeneity may be a crucial strategy for improving the efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer treatment."}
