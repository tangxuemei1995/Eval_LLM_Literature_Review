{"Abstract": "The advent of FLASH radiotherapy, characterized by ultrahigh dose rates, has revolutionized the field of radiobiology. By exploiting the transient enhancement of relative biological effectiveness, FLASH radiotherapy offers enhanced tumor killing capabilities while minimizing damage to normal tissues. This paradigm shift has significant implications for conventional radiotherapy, where normal tissue sparing remains a major challenge. Recent studies have demonstrated that FLASH radiotherapy can achieve isoefficient tumor killing, where the dose required to achieve a certain level of tumor control is comparable to that of conventional radiotherapy. This abstract reviews the current state of FLASH radiotherapy, its underlying mechanisms, and its potential to reinvent radiobiology and improve cancer treatment outcomes."}
