{"Abstract": "The tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in shaping the immune response and disease progression in cancer. To better understand the complex interactions between tumor cells and immune cells, researchers have developed organoid models that mimic the in vivo tumor environment. This study employs a novel coculture system to engineer patient-derived tumor organoids with functional immune cells, thereby recapitulating the tumor immune microenvironment. By coculturing tumor organoids with immune cells, such as T cells and dendritic cells, we observed a dynamic interplay between these cell types that influenced tumor growth, immune cell activation, and the secretion of cytokines and chemokines. These findings have significant implications for the development of immunotherapies and cancer vaccines, and provide a valuable tool for studying the tumor immune microenvironment in a highly controlled and relevant system. The use of coculture organoids offers a promising approach for personalized cancer research and therapy."}
