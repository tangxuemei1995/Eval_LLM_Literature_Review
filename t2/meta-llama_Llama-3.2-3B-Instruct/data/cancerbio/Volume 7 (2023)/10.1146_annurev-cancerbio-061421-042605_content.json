{"Abstract": "The intricate relationship between immune cell metabolism and the tumor microenvironment is a critical area of research in immuno-oncology. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of metabolic reprogramming in immune cells, enabling them to effectively target and eliminate cancerous cells. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of immune cell metabolism and its role in immuno-oncology. We discuss the key metabolic pathways involved in immune cell function, including glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and fatty acid metabolism. We also examine the impact of targeting metabolism on the tumor microenvironment, including the modulation of immune cell infiltration and the suppression of immunosuppressive pathways. Furthermore, we explore the therapeutic potential of metabolic targeting in cancer treatment, including the use of metabolic inhibitors and the development of immunotherapies that exploit metabolic vulnerabilities in cancer cells. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the complex interactions between immune cell metabolism and the tumor microenvironment, highlighting the promise of metabolic targeting in the development of novel immuno-oncological therapies."}
