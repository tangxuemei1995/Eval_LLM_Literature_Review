{"Abstract": "Cellular senescence, a state of permanent cell cycle arrest, has emerged as a critical regulator of cancer development and progression. The senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) enables senescent cells to modulate their microenvironment, influencing tumor growth, immune surveillance, and therapy response. Recent studies have highlighted the paradoxical role of senescence in cancer, where it can both suppress and promote tumor progression. The 'one-two punch' therapy, combining senolytic and immunotherapeutic approaches, has shown promise in targeting senescent cells and enhancing anti-tumor immunity. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of cellular senescence in cancer, focusing on the complex interplay between SASP, immune surveillance, and therapy-induced senescence. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying senescence in cancer, this review seeks to inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies that harness the dual benefits of senolytic and immunotherapeutic interventions."}
