{"Abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses a significant challenge for the development of effective cancer therapeutics targeting central nervous system (CNS) tumors. The BBB restricts the passage of therapeutic agents, leading to reduced efficacy and increased toxicity. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of understanding BBB dynamics and its impact on drug delivery and pharmacokinetics. Experimental cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy and targeted therapies, have shown limited success in crossing the BBB, resulting in poor treatment outcomes for CNS tumors. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the BBB and its implications for therapeutic development. We discuss the mechanisms underlying BBB function, the challenges associated with drug delivery, and the strategies being explored to overcome these limitations. By elucidating the complex interactions between the BBB and cancer therapeutics, this review seeks to inform the development of innovative therapeutic approaches for CNS tumors."}
