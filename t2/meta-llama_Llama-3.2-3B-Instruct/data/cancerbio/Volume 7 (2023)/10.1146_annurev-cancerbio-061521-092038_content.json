{"Abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in computational pathology of cancer has the potential to revolutionize diagnostic workflows and improve clinical outcomes. Recent advancements in machine learning and deep learning have enabled the development of robust algorithms that can accurately analyze large volumes of histopathological images and identify biomarkers associated with cancer. These AI-powered tools can enhance the sensitivity and specificity of cancer diagnosis, particularly in cases where histopathological features are subtle or difficult to interpret. By automating the analysis of tumor morphology and biomarker expression, AI can also facilitate the development of personalized treatment strategies and improve patient stratification for clinical trials. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of AI in computational pathology of cancer, highlighting its potential applications, limitations, and future directions for research and clinical implementation."}
