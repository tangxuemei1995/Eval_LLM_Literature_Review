{"Abstract": "The development of targeted immunotherapies has emerged as a promising approach in cancer treatment, focusing on the elimination of driver oncogenes and other public neoantigens. Adoptive cellular therapy (ACT) utilizing T cell receptors (TCRs) has shown significant potential in recognizing and targeting tumor-specific antigens. By leveraging the specificity and affinity of TCRs, ACT can selectively engage and eliminate cancer cells while sparing normal tissues. Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of TCR-based ACT in various cancer types, including melanoma, lung cancer, and leukemia. The use of TCRs has also been shown to enhance the recognition of public neoantigens, which are shared among multiple cancer patients, thereby facilitating the development of universal immunotherapies. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of TCR-based ACT for targeting driver oncogenes and public neoantigens, highlighting its clinical potential and future directions for optimization and expansion."}
