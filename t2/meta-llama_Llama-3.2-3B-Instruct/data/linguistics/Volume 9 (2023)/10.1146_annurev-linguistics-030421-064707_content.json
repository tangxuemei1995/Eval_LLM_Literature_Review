{"Abstract": "This study explores the philosophical underpinnings of constructed languages, examining their role in shaping perceptions of identity, community, and global communication. Through a critical analysis of Esperanto, a widely recognized international auxiliary language, and a selection of conlangs, this research reveals the complex interplay between linguistic structure, cognitive biases, and social context. Drawing on insights from psycholinguistics, the study demonstrates how constructed languages can facilitate cross-cultural understanding and promote linguistic diversity. By investigating the cognitive and social implications of constructed languages, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between language, culture, and power. Ultimately, this study highlights the potential of constructed languages to foster global cooperation and linguistic innovation, while also underscoring the need for nuanced consideration of their philosophical and social implications."}
