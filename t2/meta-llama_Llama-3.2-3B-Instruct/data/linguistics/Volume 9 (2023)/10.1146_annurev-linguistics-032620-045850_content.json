{"Abstract": "This study examines the intersection of language change, poetic form, and autobiographical narrative in the works of Pāṇini, a renowned ancient Indian grammarian. Through a retrospective analysis of Pāṇini's own writings, this research reveals how his grammatical theories influenced the development of poetic forms in Sanskrit literature. By exploring the autobiographical elements in Pāṇini's works, this study sheds light on the dynamic relationship between language, form, and self, highlighting the enduring legacy of Pāṇini's contributions to the field of linguistics and literature."}
