{"Abstract": "This study examines the application of computational models in resolving anaphora, a fundamental aspect of coreference resolution in natural language processing. By leveraging corpora specifically designed for anaphora analysis, we investigate the efficacy of neural models in accurately identifying bridging references and discourse deixis. Our approach employs a multi-task learning framework, where models are trained on a combination of anaphora resolution and Winograd Schema Challenge datasets. The results demonstrate significant improvements in coreference accuracy, with a notable increase in precision and recall for bridging references. These findings contribute to the development of more sophisticated computational models for anaphora resolution, ultimately enhancing the ability to capture complex discourse structures in human language."}
