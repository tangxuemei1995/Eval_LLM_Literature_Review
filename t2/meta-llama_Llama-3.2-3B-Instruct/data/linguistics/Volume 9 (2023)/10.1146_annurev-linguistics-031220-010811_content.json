{"Abstract": "This study employs the Rational Speech Act Framework (RSAF) to investigate the probabilistic and contextual aspects of human communication. Building on computational pragmatics and experimental semantics, RSAF posits that speakers' intentions are shaped by the context in which they utter language. By integrating probabilistic models of context and speech acts, RSAF provides a nuanced framework for understanding the complex interplay between speaker intentions, contextual cues, and listener interpretation. Experimental results from a large-scale study demonstrate the predictive power of RSAF in capturing the nuances of human communication. The findings suggest that RSAF offers a more comprehensive account of context-dependent communication than existing approaches, with implications for the development of more effective human-computer interaction systems and our understanding of the cognitive and social processes underlying human communication. The study contributes to the growing field of probabilistic pragmatics and provides new insights into the rationality of human speech acts."}
