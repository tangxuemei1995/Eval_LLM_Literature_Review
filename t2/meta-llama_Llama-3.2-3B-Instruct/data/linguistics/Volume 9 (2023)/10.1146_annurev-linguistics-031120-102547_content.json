{"Abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between impersonal pronouns and first-person perspective, with a focus on the role of attitude reports in shaping our understanding of genericity and indexicality. Through a mixed-methods approach combining survey data and experimental design, we examine how the use of impersonal pronouns influences individuals' perceptions of generic statements and their attitude towards the speaker. Our results suggest that the use of impersonal pronouns can lead to a decrease in indexicality, making generic statements appear more universal and less tied to the speaker's individual perspective. Furthermore, we find that attitude reports play a crucial role in mitigating the effects of impersonal pronouns on genericity, allowing speakers to convey a sense of universality while still maintaining a first-person perspective. These findings have implications for our understanding of the complex interplay between language, perspective, and attitude, and highlight the need for further research into the role of impersonal pronouns in shaping our understanding of genericity and indexicality."}
