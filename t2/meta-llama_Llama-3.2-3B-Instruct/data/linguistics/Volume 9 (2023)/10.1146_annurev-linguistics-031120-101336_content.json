{"Abstract": "The actuation problem refers to the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying the initiation and propagation of sound change in language. This phenomenon, where a sound or phoneme is replaced by another, is a fundamental aspect of language evolution and change. Research has shown that individual differences in cognitive processing style, including attention, memory, and executive control, play a significant role in shaping the actuation problem. Agent-based modeling has emerged as a valuable tool for investigating the dynamics of sound change, allowing researchers to simulate the interactions between agents with varying cognitive profiles. By examining the propagation of sound change through a network of agents, researchers can identify the key factors that influence the rate and extent of sound change. This study employs agent-based modeling to investigate the actuation problem, incorporating cognitive processing style as a key variable. The results suggest that agents with a more analytical cognitive style are more likely to actuate sound change, while those with a more holistic style are more resistant to change. These findings have implications for our understanding of the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying language change and evolution."}
