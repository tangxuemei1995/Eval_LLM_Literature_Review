{"Abstract": "This study examines the intersection of postcolonial language policy and planning (LPP) with the notion of the modern state, drawing on a Southern perspective from Sudan. The modern state is often seen as a universal model, but this study argues that its applicability is limited, particularly in postcolonial contexts. Through a critical discourse analysis of Sudanese language policies, this research highlights the tensions between the dominant Western notion of the modern state and the postcolonial realities of language use and power dynamics. The study reveals how language policies in Sudan reflect the country's complex history of colonialism, neocolonialism, and nation-building. The findings suggest that a postcolonial approach to LPP can provide a more nuanced understanding of language policy and planning in the Global South, one that acknowledges the diversity of language use and the multiple forms of power and resistance. The study contributes to the development of a more inclusive and contextualized understanding of LPP, one that recognizes the limits of the modern state and the importance of Southern perspectives."}
