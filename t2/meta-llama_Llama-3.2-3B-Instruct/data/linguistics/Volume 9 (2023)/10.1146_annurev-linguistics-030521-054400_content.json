{"Abstract": "Effective health care communication is a crucial factor in determining treatment outcomes, as it enables patients to understand their conditions, make informed decisions, and engage in collaborative care. This study employed conversation analysis to examine the physician-patient interactions in a clinical setting. The results revealed that successful communication was characterized by active listening, clear explanations, and negotiation of treatment plans. Patients who felt heard and understood were more likely to adhere to treatment recommendations and experience improved health outcomes. Conversely, ineffective communication was associated with increased anxiety, mistrust, and non-adherence. The findings highlight the importance of social interaction in shaping treatment outcomes and underscore the need for healthcare providers to adopt a patient-centered approach to communication. By fostering a collaborative and empathetic dialogue, healthcare providers can improve treatment outcomes and enhance patient satisfaction."}
