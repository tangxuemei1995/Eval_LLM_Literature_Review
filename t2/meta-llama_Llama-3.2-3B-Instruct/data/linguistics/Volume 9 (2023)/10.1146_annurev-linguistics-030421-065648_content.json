{"Abstract": "Chinese developmental dyslexia has garnered significant attention in recent years, with a growing body of research highlighting the complexities of this condition. This review aims to summarize the current state of knowledge on Chinese developmental dyslexia, focusing on linguistic profiles, brain abnormalities, and susceptibility genes. A comprehensive literature search was conducted, incorporating studies published in top-tier journals and databases. The results reveal that Chinese developmental dyslexia exhibits unique linguistic characteristics, including phonological and orthographic processing deficits. Neuroimaging studies have also identified brain abnormalities in individuals with Chinese developmental dyslexia, particularly in regions responsible for language processing. Furthermore, genetic studies have implicated susceptibility genes that may contribute to the development of Chinese developmental dyslexia. The findings of this review suggest that Chinese developmental dyslexia is a complex condition that cannot be fully explained by language-specific factors, but rather is influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The review also highlights the need for further research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of Chinese developmental dyslexia."}
