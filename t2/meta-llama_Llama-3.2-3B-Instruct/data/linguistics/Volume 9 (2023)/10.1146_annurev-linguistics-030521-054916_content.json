{"Abstract": "This study examines the sociolinguistic situation in North Africa, focusing on the recognition and institutionalization of Tamazight, a Berber language. The region's multilingual and multicultural heritage is shaped by Arabic, DƒÅrija, and other languages, with a complex history of colonization and language suppression. Despite efforts to revive Tamazight, new challenges arise from the increasing dominance of Arabic and the digital age. This research explores the tensions between language preservation and modernization, highlighting the need for linguistic and cultural policies that promote multilingualism and multiculturalism in North Africa, ensuring the continued vitality of Tamazight and other regional languages."}
