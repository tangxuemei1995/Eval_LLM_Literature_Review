{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of environmental linguistics and native science in the context of Tuva, a region in southern Siberia known for its rich biodiversity and unique cultural heritage. Drawing on decolonization theory, the research examines how traditional knowledge systems in Tuva can inform our understanding of environmental intelligence and the interconnectedness of human and natural systems. Through a critical discourse analysis of indigenous texts and oral traditions, this study reveals the ways in which Tuvan native science has been marginalized and suppressed by dominant Western epistemologies. By centering the voices and perspectives of Tuvan communities, this research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between language, culture, and the environment, and highlights the importance of decolonizing environmental discourse to promote more inclusive and sustainable approaches to conservation and environmental management."}
