{"Abstract": "Speech prosody, encompassing the rhythmic, melodic, and intonational aspects of speech, plays a crucial role in communication. Research has shown that individuals with various mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, and depression, exhibit altered speech prosody patterns. These changes can impact communication effectiveness, social interaction, and overall quality of life. This study investigates the relationship between speech prosody and mental disorders, with a focus on pragmatic and affective prosody. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that individuals with mental disorders tend to exhibit reduced prosody variability, altered prosody contours, and impaired prosody recognition. Furthermore, pragmatic prosody, which is essential for effective communication, is often disrupted in individuals with mental disorders. The findings of this review highlight the importance of considering speech prosody in the diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of mental disorders. By understanding the prosody patterns of individuals with mental disorders, clinicians can develop more effective communication strategies and improve treatment outcomes."}
