{"Abstract": "This study explores the transdisciplinary trends in the field of linguistics, examining its evolution as a distinct discipline. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify key areas of convergence with other disciplines, such as cognitive science, anthropology, and sociology. Our analysis reveals the growing recognition of linguistics as a fundamental discipline, essential for understanding human communication and its role in shaping culture and society. The findings highlight the need for a more integrated approach to language study, fostering collaboration across disciplines and advancing our understanding of language in its diverse contexts."}
