{"Abstract": "This study undertakes a comprehensive typological analysis of reciprocal constructions across languages, focusing on the interplay between morphosyntax and valency. Reciprocal constructions, where two entities engage in a mutual action, exhibit varying degrees of symmetry and valency. Through a comparative examination of 20 languages, this research identifies patterns and exceptions in the representation of reciprocal relationships. The findings reveal that reciprocal constructions often rely on specific morphological and syntactic strategies to convey symmetry and valency, highlighting the complex interplay between morphosyntax and semantic meaning. The study contributes to our understanding of the typological diversity of reciprocal constructions and their implications for linguistic theory."}
