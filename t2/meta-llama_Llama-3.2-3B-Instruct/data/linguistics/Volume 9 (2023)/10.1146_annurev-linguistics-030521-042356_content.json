{"Abstract": "This study explores the complex dynamics of language contact and typological interaction within the Altaic language family, a vast and heterogeneous group of languages spoken across Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Through a diachronic lens, this research examines the historical and areal factors that have shaped the linguistic diversity of Altaic languages, including the influence of neighboring language families and the impact of geographical and cultural contexts. By applying contextual linguistics, this investigation analyzes the complex web of language contacts and language convergence that have contributed to the unique typological features of Altaic languages. The findings of this study highlight the intricate relationships between language contact, typological interaction, and linguistic diversity, shedding new light on the complex dynamics of language evolution within the Altaic language family."}
