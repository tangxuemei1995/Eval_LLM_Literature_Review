{"Abstract": "This study explores the complex phenomenon of animal communication from a linguistic and cognitive perspective, drawing on insights from comparative cognition and the works of prominent researchers such as David Washburn and Ladygina-Kohts. By examining the duality of patterning in animal communication systems, we investigate the generative and non-generative aspects of signaling, highlighting the role of cognitive processes in shaping the structure and function of animal communication. Building on Grice's cooperative principle, we analyze how animals use cues, implicature, and inference to convey meaning and negotiate social relationships. Our analysis reveals that animal communication systems exhibit a range of generative properties, including the ability to create novel expressions and adapt to changing contexts. This research contributes to our understanding of the cognitive and linguistic underpinnings of animal communication, shedding light on the intricate relationships between cognition, language, and social behavior in non-human species."}
