{"Abstract": "This study investigates the cross-linguistic patterns of adjective ordering preferences, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms driving word order variation. A comprehensive analysis of adjective ordering in 20 languages reveals a complex interplay between modification and word order. Regularities in adjective ordering are identified, including the prevalence of post-nominal and pre-nominal adjectives, as well as the influence of grammatical case and verb agreement. The findings contribute to our understanding of the cognitive and linguistic factors shaping adjective ordering across languages, with implications for the development of typological theories and linguistic models."}
