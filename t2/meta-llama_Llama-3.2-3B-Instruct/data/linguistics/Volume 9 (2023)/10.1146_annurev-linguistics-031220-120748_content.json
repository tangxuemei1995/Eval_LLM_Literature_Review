{"Abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between serialism and opacity in phonological theory, with a focus on Optimality Theory (OT). Harmonic Serialism, a serialist approach to rule ordering, posits that rules should be ordered based on their harmonic properties. However, this approach can lead to opacity, where the ordering of rules results in an unattainable or undesirable outcome. The present research explores the implications of serialism on opacity in OT, examining the interplay between rule ordering and parallelism. Through a series of experiments and simulations, we demonstrate that serialist approaches to rule ordering can indeed lead to opacity, and that this opacity can be mitigated through the use of parallelism. Our findings have significant implications for the development of phonological theory, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between serialism and opacity in OT."}
