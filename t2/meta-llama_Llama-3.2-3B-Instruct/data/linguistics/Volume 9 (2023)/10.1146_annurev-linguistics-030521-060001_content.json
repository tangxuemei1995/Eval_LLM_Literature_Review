{"Abstract": "This study examines the contested issues surrounding homesign, a unique system of communication used by deaf individuals to convey meaning. Through a mixed-methods approach combining linguistic ethnography and sociolinguistics, we investigate the emergence and use of homesign in Deaf communities. Our findings highlight the complex relationship between homesign and sign language, revealing both similarities and differences in their grammatical structures and communicative functions. We also explore the social and cultural contexts in which homesign is used, including its role in identity formation and community building. The study contributes to our understanding of language emergence and the diverse ways in which humans communicate, challenging traditional notions of language and highlighting the importance of linguistic diversity."}
