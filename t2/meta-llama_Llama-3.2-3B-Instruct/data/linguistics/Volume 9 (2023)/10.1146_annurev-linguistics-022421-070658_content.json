{"Abstract": "This study examines the phenomenon of hyperraising, a type of movement that involves the extraction of a complement from a finite clause, resulting in a non-phase structure. Through a cross-linguistic analysis of English, Spanish, and Italian, we investigate the implications of hyperraising on the syntax and semantics of the languages. Our results suggest that hyperraising is not a single, unified process, but rather a family of related phenomena that can be analyzed from different perspectives, including defectiveness/non-phase analyses, deactivation analyses, and phase-edge analyses. We argue that these approaches provide complementary insights into the mechanisms underlying hyperraising and highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between movement and phase structure. The study contributes to ongoing debates in the literature on the nature of hyperraising and its role in the syntax of finite clauses, shedding new light on the cross-linguistic variation in this phenomenon."}
