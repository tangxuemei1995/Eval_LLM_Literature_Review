{"Abstract": "This study examines the intersection of ethics and linguistics, with a focus on the development of an ethical praxis in the field. Drawing on regulatory ethics and relational ethics, the research highlights the need for linguists to prioritize scientific validity while navigating complex power dynamics and cultural sensitivities. Through a critical analysis of existing literature and case studies, this investigation reveals the ways in which linguistic research can perpetuate or challenge dominant narratives and social inequalities. The findings emphasize the importance of relational ethics in fostering a more inclusive and equitable research environment, where linguists engage in collaborative and reciprocal relationships with communities and stakeholders. Ultimately, this research contributes to the development of a more nuanced and reflexive understanding of ethics in linguistics, one that prioritizes the well-being and agency of all individuals involved in the research process."}
