{"Abstract": "This study provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing (psycho)linguistic data using Bayesian methods. By leveraging Bayes factors and hypothesis testing, researchers can effectively quantify uncertainty and draw more accurate conclusions from experimental data. A review of existing literature reveals the limitations of traditional statistical approaches in capturing the complexity of linguistic phenomena. Our analysis demonstrates the superiority of Bayesian methods in estimating model parameters and evaluating the strength of evidence for linguistic hypotheses. The results have significant implications for the field of experimental linguistics, highlighting the need for a shift towards more nuanced and probabilistic approaches to data analysis. By adopting Bayesian methods, researchers can increase the reliability and validity of their findings, ultimately advancing our understanding of language and human cognition."}
