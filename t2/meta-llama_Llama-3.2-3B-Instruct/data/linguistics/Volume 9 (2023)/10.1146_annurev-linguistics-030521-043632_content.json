{"Abstract": "This study investigates the challenges and opportunities of verb classification across languages, with a focus on multilingual Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models. By leveraging crowdsourced knowledge augmentation, we develop a novel approach to improve the accuracy of verb classification in low-resource languages. Our method involves collecting labeled data from crowdsourcing platforms and incorporating it into pre-trained NMT models. The results show significant improvements in verb classification accuracy, particularly for low-resource languages. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the overall performance of multilingual NMT systems. The findings of this study have important implications for the development of multilingual NLP models and highlight the potential of crowdsourced knowledge augmentation in bridging the gap between high- and low-resource languages. The proposed approach can be applied to various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and machine translation."}
