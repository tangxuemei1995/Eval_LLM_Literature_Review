{"Abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and language processing in children, with a focus on syntactic parsing and parental input. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative data from a sample of 120 children from diverse SES backgrounds. Results show that children from lower SES backgrounds exhibit delayed syntactic parsing skills compared to their higher SES counterparts. Furthermore, parental input was found to be a significant predictor of syntactic parsing ability, with higher SES parents providing more targeted and explicit language instruction. The findings of this study contribute to the sociolinguistic literature on the impact of SES on language development, highlighting the importance of parental input in bridging the language gap between SES groups. The implications of these results have significant implications for language education policy and practice, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to support language development in disadvantaged populations."}
