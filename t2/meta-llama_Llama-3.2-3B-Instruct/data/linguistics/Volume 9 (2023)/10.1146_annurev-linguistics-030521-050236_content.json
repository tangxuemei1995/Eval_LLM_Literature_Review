{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex dynamics of heritage languages, focusing on the acquisition, loss, and regain of linguistic proficiency among individuals with ancestral ties to a non-native language. Through a mixed-methods approach combining survey research, interviews, and language proficiency assessments, we investigate the experiences of heritage speakers and native speakers in a bilingual community. Our findings suggest that heritage language attrition is a common phenomenon, with many individuals experiencing a decline in proficiency over time. However, we also identify instances of language reactivation, where individuals relearn and regain proficiency in their heritage language. These cases highlight the potential for language relearning and the importance of language education programs that cater to the needs of heritage speakers. The study contributes to our understanding of bilingualism, language contact, and language change, with implications for language policy and language education practices."}
