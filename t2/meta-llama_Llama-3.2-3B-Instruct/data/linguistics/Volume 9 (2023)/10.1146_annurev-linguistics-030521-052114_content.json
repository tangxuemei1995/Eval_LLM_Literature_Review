{"Abstract": "This study examines the complexities of assessing second language speaking proficiency through interactive tasks. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. A total of 100 participants, representing diverse language backgrounds and proficiency levels, completed a standardized speaking test and participated in a role-play interaction task. The results indicate that the interactive task provided a more nuanced understanding of participants' speaking abilities, capturing aspects of fluency, coherence, and pragmatic competence. The findings suggest that traditional language assessment methods may overlook the dynamic nature of spoken language, highlighting the need for more contextualized and interactive assessment tools. The study contributes to the development of more comprehensive language assessment frameworks, ultimately informing the design of more effective language teaching and learning strategies."}
