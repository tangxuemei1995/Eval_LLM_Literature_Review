{"Abstract": "The aerospace industry has witnessed significant advancements in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technology, enabling the simulation of complex fluid dynamics phenomena with unprecedented accuracy. However, despite these breakthroughs, industrial CFD challenges persist, including the need for high-performance computing infrastructure, sophisticated mesh generation, and validation of CFD models. This perspective highlights the current state of aerospace CFD technology, discussing recent developments in turbulence modeling, mesh-free methods, and hybrid approaches. The future of CFD in aerospace is also explored, with a focus on emerging trends, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, and their potential to revolutionize CFD-based design and optimization processes."}
