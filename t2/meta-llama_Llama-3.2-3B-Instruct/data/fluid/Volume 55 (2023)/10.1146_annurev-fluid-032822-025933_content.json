{"Abstract": "Elasto-inertial turbulence is a complex phenomenon characterized by the interplay between elastic and inertial forces in fluid flows. This research focuses on the investigation of elastic turbulence, a previously under-explored regime, and its potential applications in drag reduction. A numerical simulation framework is developed to model viscoelastic fluids and their interactions with coherent structures, which are crucial in transitional flows. The results show that elastic instabilities can lead to the formation of vortical structures that enhance drag reduction. The study also reveals that the use of viscoelastic models can capture the nonlinear dynamics of elastic turbulence, providing a more accurate representation of the underlying physics. The findings of this research have significant implications for the development of drag reduction strategies in various engineering applications, including pipeline transport and aerospace engineering. The numerical simulation framework is also made available for future research and validation."}
