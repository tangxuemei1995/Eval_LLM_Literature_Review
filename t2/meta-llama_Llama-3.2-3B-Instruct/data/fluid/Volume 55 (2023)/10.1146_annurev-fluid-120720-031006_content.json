{"Abstract": "Recent advances in theoretical frameworks have significantly expanded our understanding of inhomogeneous and anisotropic turbulence, a complex phenomenon characterized by spatial and directional heterogeneity. Quasi-linear theories have been employed to investigate the statistical properties of these turbulent systems, revealing intricate relationships between velocity fluctuations and spatial gradients. These findings have important implications for our comprehension of turbulent flows in various natural and engineered systems, including atmospheric and oceanic dynamics, and fluid-structure interactions."}
