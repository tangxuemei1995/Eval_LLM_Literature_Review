{"Abstract": "This study examines the impact of iceberg melting on sea level rise, with a focus on the cryosphere's role in regulating global ocean temperatures. Research indicates that the rapid melting of icebergs from the Antarctic and Arctic regions contributes significantly to sea level rise, with potential consequences for coastal ecosystems and human settlements. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that iceberg melting is linked to climate change, with rising ocean temperatures and altered precipitation patterns exacerbating the phenomenon. The study's findings suggest that the cryosphere's response to climate change is critical in understanding the dynamics of sea level rise. Furthermore, the analysis highlights the need for continued research into the interactions between the ocean, atmosphere, and ice to better predict and mitigate the effects of iceberg melting on global sea levels."}
