{"Abstract": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow plays a crucial role in maintaining the health and function of the central nervous system. The glymphatic system, a recently discovered network of CSF-filled spaces, is responsible for the clearance of waste products from the brain. However, the dynamics of CSF flow and its interaction with the glymphatic system remain poorly understood. This study employs computational fluid dynamics to investigate the effects of viscosity on CSF flow and its impact on glymphatic system function. Our results show that increased viscosity leads to reduced CSF flow rates and altered glymphatic system dynamics, highlighting the importance of considering the biological properties of CSF in understanding its role in brain health. These findings have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the glymphatic system."}
