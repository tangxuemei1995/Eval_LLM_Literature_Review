{"Abstract": "The self-propulsion of chemically active droplets has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its potential applications in microfluidics, biomedicine, and soft robotics. This phenomenon is driven by the interplay between Marangoni flows, advection-diffusion, and viscous forces. Chemically active droplets exhibit symmetry-breaking behavior, where the concentration gradient of the solute triggers a directional movement. The underlying mechanisms involve the competition between the Marangoni force, which arises from the difference in surface tension between the two sides of the droplet, and the advection-diffusion force, which is driven by the flow and diffusion of the solute. Recent studies have demonstrated the ability to control the self-propulsion of microswimmers using various strategies, including the use of surfactants, polymers, and optical tweezers. Understanding the underlying physics of this phenomenon is crucial for the design of efficient and scalable microfluidic systems, as well as the development of novel biomedical applications. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on the self-propulsion of chemically active droplets, highlighting the key mechanisms, strategies, and challenges in this rapidly evolving field."}
