{"Abstract": "Turbulent spots are localized regions within turbulent flows that exhibit distinct characteristics, such as enhanced mixing and shear rates, compared to the surrounding turbulent regions. Recent studies have shed new light on the transition from laminar to turbulent flow, with a focus on the role of turbulent spots in the development of turbulence. In pipe flow, channel flow, and plane Couette flow, turbulent spots have been observed to form at the onset of turbulence, and their presence is associated with increased mixing and reduced shear stress. Theoretical models, such as the Smagin model, have been developed to describe the formation and evolution of turbulent spots. Furthermore, experimental studies have investigated the role of turbulent spots in hypersonic flow and turbomachinery flow, highlighting their importance in these complex flow regimes. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of turbulent spots and their role in turbulent flows."}
