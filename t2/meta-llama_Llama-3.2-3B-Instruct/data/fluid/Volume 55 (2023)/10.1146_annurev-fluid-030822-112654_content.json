{"Abstract": "This biography of Irmgard Flügge-Lotz, a pioneering female researcher in fluid mechanics, highlights her groundbreaking contributions to the field of flow computation, particularly in the realm of compressible boundary layers. Born in 1903, Flügge-Lotz pursued her academic career at the University of Göttingen, where she was mentored by renowned aerodynamics expert Ludwig Prandtl. Her work on flow computation and aerodynamics control theory laid the foundation for modern computational fluid dynamics. Flügge-Lotz's research focused on the development of numerical methods for solving complex fluid flow problems, including compressible boundary layers. Her pioneering work paved the way for future generations of female researchers in fluid mechanics, challenging the male-dominated field and inspiring a new era of women in science. This biography provides an in-depth examination of Flügge-Lotz's life, work, and legacy, shedding light on her remarkable achievements and their lasting impact on the field of aerodynamics."}
