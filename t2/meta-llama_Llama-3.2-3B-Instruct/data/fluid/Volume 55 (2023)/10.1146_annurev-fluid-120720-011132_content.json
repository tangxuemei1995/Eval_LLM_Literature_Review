{"Abstract": "This study investigates the complex dynamics of motion in stratified fluids, focusing on the interactions between particles, drops, and bubbles, as well as microorganisms, within a pycnocline. The pycnocline, a distinct layering of fluids with varying densities, is a critical feature of stratified flows. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and numerical simulations, we examine the effects of particle-laden flows on the motion of particles, drops, and bubbles within the pycnocline. Our analysis reveals the intricate relationships between particle size, density, and flow velocity, as well as the impact of microorganisms on the stratified flow dynamics. The findings of this study have significant implications for our understanding of stratified fluid flows and their applications in various fields, including environmental science, engineering, and biology."}
