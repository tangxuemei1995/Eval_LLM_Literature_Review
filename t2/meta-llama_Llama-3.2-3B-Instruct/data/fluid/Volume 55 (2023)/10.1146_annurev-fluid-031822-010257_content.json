{"Abstract": "Deep-sea mining, a growing industry, poses significant challenges in understanding the complex interactions between mining activities and the surrounding ocean environment. This study investigates the fluid mechanics of deep-sea mining, focusing on sediment transport, plume formation, and settling processes. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that sediment plumes, generated by mining activities, can transport large volumes of sediment and turbidity currents, leading to significant changes in the seafloor topography. The settling of sediment particles is influenced by flocculation, a process that aggregates particles into larger clusters, affecting the overall sediment transport dynamics. This research highlights the importance of physical oceanography in understanding the fluid mechanics of deep-sea mining, and emphasizes the need for further studies to develop effective mitigation strategies to minimize the environmental impacts of this industry. The findings of this study contribute to the development of a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between deep-sea mining and the ocean environment."}
