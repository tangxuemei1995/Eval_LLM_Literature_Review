{"Abstract": "The interaction between three-dimensional shock waves and boundary layers is a complex phenomenon that can lead to significant changes in flow behavior, including turbulence, separation, and instability. This interaction can have far-reaching consequences for fluid/structure interactions, flow control, and overall aerodynamic performance. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of considering the three-dimensional nature of these interactions, which can lead to the formation of shear layers and altered stability characteristics. The present review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of three-dimensional shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions, with a focus on the underlying physical mechanisms and the impact on fluid/structure interactions. The review will cover the key aspects of shock wave generation, boundary layer development, and the resulting interactions, including the role of turbulence, separation, and shear layer stability. The discussion will also highlight the challenges and opportunities for flow control and the potential for advanced numerical and experimental techniques to improve our understanding of these complex interactions."}
