{"Abstract": "This study presents a novel approach to simulating and analyzing free surface flows with singularities, focusing on the complex phenomena of breakup and coalescence in microfluidic systems. A sharp interface method is developed to capture the intricate dynamics of ink jet printing, sprays, and microfluidic devices, where singularities play a crucial role in the formation of droplets, jets, and filaments. The proposed method employs a finite element-based approach to solve the Navier-Stokes equations, incorporating a sharp interface capture technique to accurately represent the free surface and singularities. The results demonstrate the ability of the method to accurately predict the breakup and coalescence of droplets, jets, and filaments in various microfluidic configurations. The study provides a significant contribution to the understanding of free surface flows with singularities, with potential applications in ink jet printing, microfluidics, and other fields where complex fluid dynamics are involved."}
