{"Abstract": "This study explores the feasibility of conducting cutting-edge tabletop science experiments in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) despite limited resources. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining surveys, interviews, and focus groups with graduate students and early-career researchers in LMICs. Results indicate that despite resource constraints, participants were able to design and conduct innovative tabletop experiments, often leveraging local materials and collaborations. The study highlights the importance of scientific career professional development in LMICs, where access to resources and mentorship can be limited. The findings have implications for graduate education and research under resource constraints, suggesting that tabletop science can be a viable means of advancing scientific knowledge in LMICs."}
