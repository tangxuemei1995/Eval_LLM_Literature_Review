{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of face masks in reducing the transmission of respiratory infections. However, the underlying physics of face mask performance remains poorly understood. This study investigates the flow physics of face masks, focusing on the impact of mask design, fit, and user behavior on airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Using computational fluid dynamics and experimental measurements, we analyzed the airflow patterns around different types of face masks, including surgical masks, cloth masks, and respirators. Our results show that mask fit and seal play a critical role in reducing airborne transmission, with masks that fit snugly around the face exhibiting significantly lower airflow rates and increased turbulence. We also found that user behavior, such as mask tightening and breathing patterns, can significantly impact mask performance. These findings have important implications for the design and use of face masks, highlighting the need for standardized mask designs and user guidelines to maximize their effectiveness in reducing airborne transmission of respiratory infections. By elucidating the flow physics of face masks, this study contributes to the development of evidence-based strategies for mitigating the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses."}
