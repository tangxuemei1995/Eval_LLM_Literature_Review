{"Abstract": "Turbulent rotating Rayleigh–Bénard convection is a complex phenomenon that involves the interplay between buoyancy-driven fluid motion, rotation, and turbulent heat transport. In this context, the interfacial layer between the rotating fluid and the surrounding environment plays a crucial role in modulating the flow and heat transfer characteristics. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) have been employed to investigate the effects of rotation on turbulent Rayleigh–Bénard convection, revealing a significant impact on the flow structure, turbulence statistics, and heat transport. The results indicate that rotation can lead to the formation of rotating vortices, which in turn modulate the turbulent flow and heat transfer. Furthermore, the DNS simulations demonstrate that the rotation-induced anisotropy in the turbulent flow can result in a non-uniform heat transport, with the heat flux being enhanced near the rotating fluid interface. The findings of this study provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of turbulent rotating Rayleigh–Bénard convection and have important implications for the design of rotating systems in various engineering applications, including heat exchangers and fluid processors."}
