{"Abstract": "Particle rafts and armored droplets are complex systems that exhibit unique properties at the interface between two immiscible liquids. These systems arise from the self-assembly of particles at the interface, which can lead to the formation of stable, buoyant structures that resist deformation and breakup. The interplay between particle-laden interfaces, capillarity, and interfacial rheology plays a crucial role in determining the morphology and stability of these systems. Recent studies have demonstrated that the addition of particles to an interface can significantly alter the surface tension and viscosity of the system, leading to the formation of particle rafts and armored droplets. These structures can exhibit enhanced elasticity and resistance to deformation, making them of interest for applications in fields such as microfluidics, biomedicine, and materials science. This review provides an overview of the current understanding of particle rafts and armored droplets, including their formation mechanisms, morphological characteristics, and potential applications. The interplay between particle-laden interfaces, buoyancy, and interfacial rheology is discussed in detail, highlighting the complex interactions that govern the behavior of these systems."}
