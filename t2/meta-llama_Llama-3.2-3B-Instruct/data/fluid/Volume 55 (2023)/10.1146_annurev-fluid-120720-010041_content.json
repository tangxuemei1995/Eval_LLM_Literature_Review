{"Abstract": "This study examines the development of fluid mechanics in France during the first half of the twentieth century, a period marked by significant advancements in aeronautical engineering. The early twentieth century saw the establishment of the École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures in Paris, which played a crucial role in shaping the country's fluid mechanics research agenda. The work of prominent French engineers, such as Henri Coandă and André Labrousse, contributed substantially to the field, with notable achievements in aerodynamics and hydrodynamics. The French government's investment in aeronautical research and development, particularly through the creation of the Centre National d'Etudes Aérospatiales (CNEA), facilitated the growth of fluid mechanics in France. The study highlights the key figures, institutions, and events that drove the development of fluid mechanics in France during this period, and demonstrates the profound impact of French research on the global aeronautical industry. By exploring the historical context and key milestones, this research provides a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of fluid mechanics in France during the first half of the twentieth century."}
