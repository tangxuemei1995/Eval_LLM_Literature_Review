{"Abstract": "Gas-liquid foams are complex systems exhibiting unique structural and dynamic properties, arising from the interplay between gas bubbles and liquid matrix. This review synthesizes recent advances in understanding the underlying mechanics governing foam behavior, from the structural elements of individual bubbles to continuum descriptions of foam-scale phenomena. Interfacial mechanics plays a crucial role in determining foam stability, rheology, and flow properties. Theoretical models, computational simulations, and experimental studies have been employed to elucidate the relationships between bubble size, shape, and distribution, as well as the effects of surfactants, temperature, and pressure on foam dynamics. The review highlights the importance of thin film dynamics in foam formation and stability, and discusses the implications of these findings for applications in various fields, including materials science, chemical engineering, and biomedicine. By integrating insights from multiple disciplines, this review aims to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding gas-liquid foam dynamics."}
