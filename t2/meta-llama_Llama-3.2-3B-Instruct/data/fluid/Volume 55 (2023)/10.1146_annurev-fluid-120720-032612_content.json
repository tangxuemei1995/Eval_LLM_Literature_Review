{"Abstract": "Rotating detonation engines (RDEs) have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential to achieve high-pressure gain combustion and efficient energy conversion. However, the complex interplay of nonidealities in RDEs can lead to significant deflagration loss and reduced engine performance. This study investigates the effects of unsteady mixing and secondary combustion on the detonation wave dynamics in RDEs. A comprehensive numerical analysis is performed using a 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, incorporating the effects of secondary waves and multiple competing detonation waves. The results show that the secondary combustion process can lead to a significant increase in deflagration loss, while the unsteady mixing process can result in a reduction in pressure gain combustion. The interaction between the primary and secondary waves is found to be a critical factor in determining the overall engine performance. The findings of this study highlight the importance of considering nonidealities in RDEs and provide valuable insights for the optimization of RDE design and operation. The results have significant implications for the development of more efficient and reliable RDEs for future aerospace applications."}
