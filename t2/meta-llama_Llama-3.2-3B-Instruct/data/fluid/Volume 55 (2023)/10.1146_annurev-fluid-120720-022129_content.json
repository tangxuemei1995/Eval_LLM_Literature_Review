{"Abstract": "Immersed boundary methods (IBMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for simulating complex flows and multiphysics problems in various fields, including fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and structural mechanics. This review provides a historical perspective on the development of IBMs, tracing their origins to the early 20th century and highlighting key milestones, such as the work of von Mises and von Karman. The review also discusses the evolution of IBMs over the years, with a focus on advances in numerical methods, wall models, and multiphysics formulations. IBMs have been successfully applied to a wide range of problems, including turbulent flows, boundary layers, and coupled thermal-fluid problems. The review highlights the strengths and limitations of IBMs, including their ability to capture complex flow phenomena and their potential for parallelization. Future outlooks for IBMs include the development of new numerical methods, such as machine learning-based approaches, and the integration of IBMs with other computational methods, such as meshfree methods. Overall, IBMs have established themselves as a valuable tool for simulating complex flows and multiphysics problems, and their continued development is expected to drive advances in various fields of engineering and science."}
