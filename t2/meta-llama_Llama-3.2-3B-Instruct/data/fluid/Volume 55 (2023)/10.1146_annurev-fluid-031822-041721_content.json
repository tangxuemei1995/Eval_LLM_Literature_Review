{"Abstract": "Three-dimensional Lagrangian particle tracking is a crucial technique in fluid mechanics for accurately measuring velocity fields and pressure distributions in complex flows. This method involves tracking the motion of particles in a fluid over time, allowing for the reconstruction of velocity gradients and pressure fields. In this study, we employ an iterative particle reconstruction approach, inspired by the Shake-The-Box method, to improve the accuracy of 3D particle tracking velocimetry. By combining one-point and multipoint statistics, we derive a velocity gradient tensor that provides a comprehensive description of the flow. The results are validated using data assimilation techniques, which enable the estimation of 3D pressure fields from sparse measurement data. The proposed method demonstrates improved accuracy and robustness in tracking complex flows, making it a valuable tool for researchers and engineers in the field of fluid mechanics."}
