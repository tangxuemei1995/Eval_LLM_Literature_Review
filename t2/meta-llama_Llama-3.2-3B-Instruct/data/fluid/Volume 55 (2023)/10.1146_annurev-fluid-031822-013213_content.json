{"Abstract": "This study investigates the evaporation of sessile droplets using a combination of mathematical modeling and experimental validation. A diffusion-limited evaporation model is developed to capture the complex interplay between droplet size, surface tension, and ambient conditions. The model predicts multiple evaporation modes and droplet lifetimes, which are verified through experiments involving deposition of water droplets on various surfaces. The findings provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of droplet evaporation and deposition."}
