{"Abstract": "The transition to turbulence in pipe flow is a complex phenomenon characterized by the emergence of chaotic and turbulent structures. This study investigates the role of transient growth and directed percolation in the onset of turbulence. By analyzing high-resolution simulations of pipe flow, we find that transient growth, which refers to the temporary increase in kinetic energy, plays a crucial role in the development of turbulent structures. Furthermore, we observe that directed percolation, a process where clusters of fluid particles are connected in a specific manner, contributes to the formation of turbulent puffs and slugs. Our results suggest that the interplay between transient growth and directed percolation is essential for the transition to turbulence in pipe flow, and that understanding these mechanisms is crucial for predicting and controlling turbulent flows in various engineering applications."}
