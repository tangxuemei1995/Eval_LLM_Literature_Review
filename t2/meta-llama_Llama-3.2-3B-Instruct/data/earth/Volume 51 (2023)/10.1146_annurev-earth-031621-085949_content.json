{"Abstract": "Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry (CCT) has emerged as a powerful tool for reconstructing paleotemperatures in geological systems, offering a more precise and robust alternative to traditional stable isotope methods. By analyzing the clumped isotopic composition of carbonates, researchers can infer temperature conditions under which these minerals formed. Recent advances in CCT have expanded its applications to a wide range of geological settings, including sedimentary basins, hydrothermal systems, and metamorphic terranes. This review synthesizes the current state of knowledge in CCT, highlighting its theoretical foundations, analytical techniques, and applications in various fields of geochemistry. The review also discusses the limitations and challenges associated with CCT, including the need for high-precision measurements and the potential for contamination and degradation of clumped isotopes. Furthermore, the review explores the potential of CCT to integrate with other geochemical and geophysical methods, enabling more comprehensive understanding of complex geological systems. By examining the frontiers of CCT, this review aims to provide a framework for future research and development of this rapidly evolving field, ultimately advancing our understanding of Earth's thermal evolution and the geological processes that shape our planet."}
