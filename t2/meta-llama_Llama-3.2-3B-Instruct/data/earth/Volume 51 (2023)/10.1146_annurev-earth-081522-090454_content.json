{"Abstract": "The Neogene period, spanning from approximately 23 to 2.6 million years ago, witnessed significant changes in the Amazonian flora, shaped by geological, palynological, and molecular phylogenetic data. This study integrates these diverse datasets to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the Amazonian flora during this critical period. Paleoclimatic reconstructions indicate that the Amazon region experienced a series of glacial-interglacial cycles, with pronounced fluctuations in temperature and precipitation patterns. These environmental changes had a profound impact on the distribution, diversity, and evolution of plant species in the region.Palynological analysis of fossil pollen records reveals a complex pattern of changes in vegetation composition and structure across the Neogene period. The data suggest that the Amazonian flora underwent a series of expansions and contractions in response to climate change, with some species exhibiting rapid radiations and others experiencing significant declines. Molecular phylogenetic studies provide further insights into the evolutionary relationships among Amazonian plant species, highlighting the importance of biogeographic patterns in shaping the regional flora.The integration of these datasets reveals a dynamic and adaptive Amazonian flora that responded to changing environmental conditions throughout the Neogene period. The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of the complex interactions between climate change, geological processes, and the evolution of plant species in the Amazon region. By examining the Neogene history of the Amazonian flora, this research provides a unique perspective on the long-term dynamics of the region's ecosystems and highlights the importance of considering the interplay between environmental change and biological evolution in understanding the complex history of the Amazonian flora."}
