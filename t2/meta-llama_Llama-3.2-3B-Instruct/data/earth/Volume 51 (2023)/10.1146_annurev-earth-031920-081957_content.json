{"Abstract": "The Rock-Hosted Biosphere refers to the complex network of microbial communities inhabiting the subsurface of rocks, particularly those with fractures and cavities. These endolithic organisms, often exhibiting chemolithoautotrophy, thrive in environments where oxygen is scarce or absent. Through intricate relationships with their host rock, microbes facilitate the cycling of essential elements, influencing the geochemical composition of the surrounding crust. Research has revealed that microbial activity in these environments can significantly impact the formation and evolution of economic deposits, such as copper and gold. This phenomenon highlights the critical role of subsurface microbial communities in shaping the Earth's geochemical landscape, underscoring the need for further investigation into the dynamics of the Rock-Hosted Biosphere."}
