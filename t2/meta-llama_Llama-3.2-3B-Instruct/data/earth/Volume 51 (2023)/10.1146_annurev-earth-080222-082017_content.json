{"Abstract": "During the late Paleozoic era, approximately 300-250 million years ago, plants underwent a profound transformation that significantly impacted the Earth's environment. This transformation was characterized by the evolution of complex plant functional traits and strategies, which enabled plants to adapt to changing environmental conditions and ultimately shape the course of the Earth's ecosystems. This study employs a systems approach to understand the dynamics of vegetation-climate interactions during this critical period in Earth's history. By integrating insights from plant functional traits, ecosystem modeling, and Earth system modeling, we reconstruct the evolution of plant functional strategies and their impact on the Earth's climate and ecosystems. Our results suggest that the evolution of plant functional traits, such as root depth and leaf morphology, played a crucial role in modulating the Earth's climate and influencing the development of ecosystems. We also demonstrate that vegetation-climate interactions during the late Paleozoic era were characterized by complex feedback loops, where changes in plant functional traits and ecosystem processes interacted to shape the Earth's climate and ecosystems. Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of the Earth's history and the role of plants in shaping the planet's environment. By integrating insights from multiple disciplines, we provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex interactions between plants, climate, and ecosystems during the late Paleozoic era."}
