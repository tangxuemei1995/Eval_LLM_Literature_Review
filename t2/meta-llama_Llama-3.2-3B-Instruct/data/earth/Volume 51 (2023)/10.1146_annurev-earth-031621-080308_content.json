{"Abstract": "The formation of bubbles in magma is a critical process that governs the dynamics of volcanic eruptions. This phenomenon is influenced by the interplay between volatiles, such as water and carbon dioxide, and the physical properties of the magma. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of spinodal decomposition, a thermodynamic process that leads to the formation of stable interfaces between immiscible phases. In this context, the nucleation of bubbles in magma can be viewed as a spinodal decomposition process, where volatiles and magma components interact to form a network of stable interfaces. The resulting bubble dynamics are characterized by complex interactions between buoyancy, viscosity, and surface tension. Experimental and numerical studies have shown that the formation of bubbles in magma is influenced by factors such as magma composition, temperature, and pressure. The study of bubble formation in magma has significant implications for our understanding of volcanic eruptions, including the prediction of eruption styles and the estimation of eruption volumes. This review aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of bubble formation in magma, with a focus on the role of spinodal decomposition and the dynamics of bubble interactions. By integrating experimental and theoretical approaches, this review seeks to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex processes that govern bubble formation in magma."}
