{"Abstract": "Elastic thermobarometry is a novel approach that integrates elastic properties and Raman spectroscopy to quantify pressure-temperature conditions in metamorphic rocks. By analyzing the elastic moduli and Raman spectra of minerals, researchers can reconstruct the thermal and pressure history of these rocks. This method is particularly useful for determining the P-T conditions of high-pressure metamorphic events, such as those occurring during mountain building processes. The elastic properties of minerals are sensitive to pressure and temperature, while Raman spectroscopy provides information on the mineral's chemical composition and structure. By combining these two techniques, elastic thermobarometry offers a powerful tool for reconstructing the P-T evolution of metamorphic rocks, providing valuable insights into the geological history of complex terranes."}
