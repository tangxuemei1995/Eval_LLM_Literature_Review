{"Abstract": "Xenolithic eclogites are enigmatic rocks that exhibit a complex mixture of eclogitic and granulitic facies, often formed through the interaction of kimberlite magmas with the surrounding lithospheric mantle. These rocks provide valuable insights into the paleo-subduction zones and deep geochemical cycles that have shaped the evolution of continents. This review synthesizes the current understanding of petrogenesis and geodynamic significance of xenolithic eclogites, with a focus on their formation mechanisms, geochemical characteristics, and implications for the convecting mantle. Kimberlite-borne xenolithic eclogites are found in various parts of the world, including the Kaapvaal Craton, the Slave Craton, and the Siberian Traps. These rocks exhibit a range of geochemical signatures, from magnesium-rich to aluminum-poor, and display a variety of textures, including eclogitic and granulitic facies. The presence of xenolithic eclogites in these regions suggests that they formed in paleo-subduction zones, where the lithospheric mantle was subjected to high-pressure and high-temperature conditions. The geochemical characteristics of these rocks provide evidence for the deep geochemical cycles that have operated in the convecting mantle, influencing the evolution of continents and the formation of economic deposits. This review highlights the importance of xenolithic eclogites as a window into the Earth's mantle evolution and the deep geochemical cycles that have shaped the Earth's surface."}
