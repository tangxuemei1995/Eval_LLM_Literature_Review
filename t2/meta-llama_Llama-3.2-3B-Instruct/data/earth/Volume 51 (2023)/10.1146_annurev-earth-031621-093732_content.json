{"Abstract": "River deltas are complex and dynamic systems that play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, coastal protection, and biodiversity hotspots. However, the increasing frequency and severity of sea-level rise pose a significant threat to the very existence of these ecosystems. This study examines the impact of sea-level rise on river deltas, with a focus on geomorphological changes, sedimentary processes, and shoreline evolution. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that sea-level rise can lead to increased sedimentation, changes in river flow patterns, and coastal erosion, ultimately resulting in the loss of deltaic land and the degradation of ecosystem services. The study also highlights the importance of considering the interplay between climate change, river discharge, and sediment supply in predicting the vulnerability of river deltas to sea-level rise. Geomorphological modeling and sediment transport simulations are used to investigate the effects of sea-level rise on deltaic morphology and shoreline dynamics. The results suggest that river deltas are highly susceptible to sea-level rise, and that early warning systems and adaptive management strategies are essential for mitigating the impacts of climate change on these ecosystems. This research contributes to our understanding of the complex relationships between river deltas, sea-level rise, and climate change, and highlights the need for integrated approaches to managing these ecosystems in the face of global change."}
