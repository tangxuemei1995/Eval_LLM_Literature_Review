{"Abstract": "Fracture energy and breakdown work are critical components of earthquake rupture dynamics, governing the release of seismic energy and the resulting fault damage. This study investigates the interplay between fracture energy and breakdown work during earthquakes, with a focus on dynamic weakening and rupture dynamics. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of earthquake rupture processes, we demonstrate that fracture energy and breakdown work are closely linked, with increased breakdown work leading to enhanced fracture energy release. Our results show that the fault zone structure plays a crucial role in modulating the relationship between fracture energy and breakdown work, with varying fault geometries and materials influencing the efficiency of energy release. Furthermore, we find that dynamic weakening, a process characterized by the gradual degradation of fault strength during rupture, is a key mechanism governing the earthquake energy budget. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the underlying physics of earthquake rupture and the development of more accurate earthquake hazard assessments. By integrating fracture energy and breakdown work into a comprehensive framework of rupture dynamics, we provide new insights into the complex processes governing earthquake rupture and the resulting fault damage. The results of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the earthquake energy budget and the role of fault zone structure in modulating seismic energy release."}
