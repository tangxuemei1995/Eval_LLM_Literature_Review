{"Abstract": "Iceberg calving, the process by which large chunks of ice break off from glaciers and ice shelves, plays a critical role in shaping the dynamics of ice sheets and contributing to sea-level rise. This phenomenon is particularly significant in the context of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which are the largest sources of freshwater to the oceans. Research has shown that iceberg calving regimes can be characterized by distinct patterns of calving intensity, frequency, and spatial distribution, which are influenced by a range of factors including climate variability, ice sheet geometry, and ocean-ice interactions. The Greenland ice sheet, for example, has experienced significant calving activity in recent decades, with the Larsen C ice shelf in West Antarctica being a notable example of a rapidly calving ice shelf. In contrast, the Antarctic ice sheet has a more complex calving regime, with both rapid and slow calving events occurring across different regions. Understanding the underlying mechanisms driving these calving regimes is essential for predicting future changes in ice sheet stability and sea-level rise. This review synthesizes existing research on iceberg calving regimes and transitions, highlighting the key factors that influence calving intensity and frequency, and discussing the implications for ice sheet stability and sea-level rise. By examining the complex interactions between climate, ice sheet geometry, and ocean-ice interactions, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of iceberg calving and its role in shaping the future of the world's ice sheets."}
