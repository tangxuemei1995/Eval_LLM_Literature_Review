{"Abstract": "The lithospheric mantle, a critical component of the Earth's lithosphere, exhibits ductile deformation under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions. This deformation is characterized by the plastic flow of minerals, such as olivine, and the resulting strain hardening of the mantle. The deformation mechanisms underlying ductile flow in the lithospheric mantle are complex and involve the interaction of multiple minerals and microstructures. This study investigates the deformation mechanisms of the lithospheric mantle using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches. Olivine, a key mineral in the mantle, is subjected to high-pressure and high-temperature conditions to simulate the conditions found in the Earth's mantle. The resulting deformation is characterized by the formation of subgrains and the development of strain hardening. Theoretical models are used to simulate the deformation of the mantle and to understand the role of olivine in controlling the deformation mechanisms. The results of this study provide new insights into the ductile deformation of the lithospheric mantle and have implications for our understanding of the Earth's lithospheric evolution. The findings of this research contribute to the development of a more comprehensive understanding of the deformation mechanisms underlying the lithospheric mantle and highlight the importance of olivine in controlling the deformation processes."}
