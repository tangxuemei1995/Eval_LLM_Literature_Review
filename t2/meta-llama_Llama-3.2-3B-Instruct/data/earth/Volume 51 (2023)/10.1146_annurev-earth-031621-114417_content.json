{"Abstract": "Climate change poses a profound threat to global societies, necessitating a multifaceted approach to mitigate its impacts. This abstract outlines the critical role of communication and behavior science in enhancing society's response to climate change. By leveraging insights from behavioral psychology, social influence theory, and communication frameworks, researchers can design effective strategies to promote climate change awareness, foster pro-environmental behaviors, and encourage collective action. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that targeted interventions, such as personalized messaging, social norms campaigns, and gamification, can significantly influence individuals' attitudes and behaviors. Moreover, the integration of communication and behavior science with existing climate change mitigation efforts can amplify their effectiveness. This abstract highlights the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between climate scientists, communication specialists, and behavior scientists to develop evidence-based solutions for climate change mitigation and adaptation. By harnessing the power of communication and behavior science, we can foster a more resilient and sustainable society, capable of responding effectively to the challenges posed by climate change. Ultimately, this research aims to inform the development of effective communication and behavior change strategies, ultimately contributing to a low-carbon future."}
