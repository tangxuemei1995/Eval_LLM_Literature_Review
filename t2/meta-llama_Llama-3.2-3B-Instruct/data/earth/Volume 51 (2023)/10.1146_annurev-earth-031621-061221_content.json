{"Abstract": "Mimas, a moon of Saturn, has long been a subject of intrigue due to its unique characteristics, sparking debate regarding its geological history. This study examines the moon's potential for hosting an ocean world, with a focus on the interplay between tectonic processes, rotational dynamics, and satellite formation. Our analysis reveals that Mimas' subsurface ocean, if present, could be influenced by tidal heating, driven by Saturn's gravitational forces. This process would lead to the moon's interior being partially molten, resulting in tectonic activity and the potential for a liquid water ocean. Furthermore, our simulations suggest that Mimas' rotation rate and orbital dynamics could have played a crucial role in shaping its surface features, including the formation of its prominent crater, Herschel. The findings of this research contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between a moon's internal dynamics, its orbital environment, and the emergence of ocean worlds. Ultimately, this study provides new insights into the possibility of Mimas serving as a frozen fragment, ring relic, or emerging ocean world, challenging our current understanding of the moon's geological evolution."}
