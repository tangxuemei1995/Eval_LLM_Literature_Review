{"Abstract": "The formation of the Moon is a complex and multifaceted process that has been extensively studied through various lines of evidence. The prevailing giant impact hypothesis, first proposed by Wetherill and Kring in 1998, suggests that the Moon was formed from debris left over after a massive collision between the Earth and a Mars-sized object, sometimes referred to as Theia. This collision is believed to have occurred approximately 4.5 billion years ago, resulting in a lunar magma ocean that eventually solidified to form the Moon's crust. However, recent studies have challenged this model, proposing alternative chronologies for Moon formation. For instance, a 2019 study published in Nature suggested that the Moon's crust may have formed through a series of smaller impacts, rather than a single giant event. Additionally, model ages of the Moon's crust have been reevaluated, with some studies indicating that the Moon's oldest rocks may be significantly younger than previously thought. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge on the Moon's chronology, discussing the implications of these new findings for our understanding of the Moon's formation and evolution. By integrating evidence from lunar geology, geochemistry, and modeling, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the evolving chronology of Moon formation and its potential implications for the field of planetary science."}
