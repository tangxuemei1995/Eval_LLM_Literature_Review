{"Abstract": "The Lomagundi-Jatuli Carbon Isotope Excursion (LJCE) is a pivotal event in the Precambrian history, marked by a significant shift in the Earth's carbon cycle. This excursion, occurring during the Paleoproterozoic era, is characterized by a pronounced decrease in 13C/12C ratios, indicating a substantial increase in atmospheric oxygen levels. The LJCE is widely regarded as a key component of the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), a period of rapid oxygenation that paved the way for the evolution of complex life forms. This study deconstructs the LJCE, examining the geochemical and paleoenvironmental evidence that supports its occurrence. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that the LJCE was accompanied by a concomitant increase in iron oxide and silicate weathering, suggesting a significant shift in the Earth's surface processes. The findings of this research provide new insights into the mechanisms driving the LJCE and its relationship to the GOE, highlighting the importance of this event in shaping the Earth's history and the evolution of life on our planet. The results of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the Precambrian carbon cycle and its role in the development of the Earth's biosphere."}
