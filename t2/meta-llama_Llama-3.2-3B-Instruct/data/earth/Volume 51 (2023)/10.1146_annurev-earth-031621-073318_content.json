{"Abstract": "Mars seismology has emerged as a vital tool for understanding the Martian interior structure and geological evolution. The discovery of marsquakes, also known as marsquakes, has provided valuable insights into the planet's internal dynamics and composition. These seismic events are generated by impacts, tectonic activity, and other processes that shape the Martian crust. The Cerberus Fossae, a vast impact basin located in the southern hemisphere, has been identified as a significant source of marsquakes. By analyzing the seismic data from the InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) and seismometer networks, researchers have been able to reconstruct the Martian interior structure and infer the presence of a partially molten core. The study of marsquakes has also shed light on the planet's tectonic history, including the formation of the Tharsis bulge and the evolution of the Martian crust. Furthermore, the analysis of marsquake data has revealed the presence of a crust-mantle boundary, which is thought to be a key factor in the planet's geological evolution. This research highlights the importance of seismology in understanding the complex and dynamic interior of Mars, and its potential to provide valuable insights into the planet's geological history and evolution."}
