{"Abstract": "The evolution of atmospheric oxygen (O2) levels has been a subject of intense debate among scientists, with various theories attempting to explain the significant increase in O2 concentrations over the Phanerozoic eon. This review revisits the current understanding of O2 evolution, integrating recent geochemical and paleontological findings. Our analysis suggests that the oxygenation of the atmosphere was a complex, multi-stage process involving the interplay of various biological and geochemical mechanisms. The earliest evidence of oxygenation dates back to the Neoproterozoic era, approximately 2.7 billion years ago, when oxygen-producing cyanobacteria first emerged. However, it was not until the Cambrian explosion, around 541 million years ago, that oxygen levels began to rise significantly, likely due to the evolution of complex animal life. The development of the carbon cycle and the formation of the modern ocean-atmosphere system also played crucial roles in shaping O2 levels. Our review highlights the importance of considering the geochemical context in which life evolved, and underscores the need for further research into the mechanisms driving O2 evolution. By integrating insights from paleontology, geochemistry, and biology, we aim to provide a more comprehensive understanding of this critical process and its implications for the Earth's climate and life on Earth."}
