{"Abstract": "The Phanerozoic eon, spanning over 541 million years, has witnessed significant fluctuations in the Earth's carbon cycle, with profound implications for the planet's climate. This study examines the evolution of carbon sources and sinks over the Phanerozoic, with a focus on the role of geological processes and biological productivity. We employ a suite of paleoclimate models, including the Earth System Model of Alternative Projections (ESMAP) and the Community Earth System Model (CESM), to simulate the carbon cycle under various geological and biological scenarios. Our results indicate that the Phanerozoic carbon cycle has been characterized by a complex interplay between weathering, oceanic carbon sequestration, and atmospheric CO2 levels. We find that the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras were marked by a significant increase in atmospheric CO2, driven by the rapid growth of marine life and the associated release of organic carbon. In contrast, the Cenozoic era has seen a decline in atmospheric CO2, largely due to the increased efficiency of weathering processes and the formation of carbonate sediments. Our models also suggest that the evolution of terrestrial ecosystems, including the development of forests and grasslands, has played a crucial role in modulating the carbon cycle over the Phanerozoic. The results of this study have important implications for our understanding of the Earth's climate system and the potential consequences of future changes in the carbon cycle. By integrating paleoclimate modeling with geological and biological data, we provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex dynamics of the Phanerozoic carbon cycle and its relevance to modern climate change."}
