{"Abstract": "The Gangdese Batholith, a large igneous complex in southern Tibet, provides a unique window into the continental crustal growth processes that occurred during the Indian-Eurasian collision. This collision, which began approximately 50 million years ago, resulted in the formation of the Himalayan mountain range and the thickening of the Indian crust. The Gangdese Batholith, a magmatic arc that formed in response to this collision, exhibits a complex stratification of crustal rocks, including granites, gabbros, and basalts. Geochemical and petrological analysis of the batholith's rocks reveal a distinct crustal growth process, characterized by the incremental addition of magma to the crust, followed by the emplacement of granitic rocks. This process, known as crustal accretion, resulted in the formation of a thickened crust that was later deformed and metamorphosed during the collision. The Gangdese Batholith's crustal growth process is also reflected in its stratigraphic structure, which shows a clear sequence of crustal formation and deformation. The study of the Gangdese Batholith provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of continental crustal growth and the geological processes that shape the Earth's surface during periods of intense tectonic activity. By understanding these processes, researchers can better comprehend the complex geological history of the Himalayan region and the ongoing effects of the Indian-Eurasian collision."}
