{"Abstract": "The increasing concern over climate change has led to the exploration of geoengineering as a potential means to mitigate its effects. One such approach is solar geoengineering, which involves modifying solar radiation to reflect a portion of it back into space. This can alter the Earth's energy balance and, in turn, impact the hydrological cycle. Research has shown that solar geoengineering can lead to changes in precipitation patterns, with some studies suggesting a decrease in precipitation in certain regions and an increase in others. The hydrological consequences of solar geoengineering are complex and multifaceted, involving interactions between the atmosphere, oceans, and land surfaces. This study examines the potential hydrological impacts of solar geoengineering, with a focus on the effects on precipitation patterns and water resources. Using a combination of climate models and hydrological simulations, we investigate the potential changes in precipitation and water availability resulting from solar geoengineering. Our results suggest that solar geoengineering could lead to significant changes in the hydrological cycle, with far-reaching implications for water resources and ecosystems. The findings of this study highlight the need for further research into the hydrological consequences of solar geoengineering and the development of strategies to mitigate its potential impacts."}
