{"Abstract": "The formation of planets is a complex process that has been shaped by various mechanisms, including giant impacts. These high-energy collisions between planetary embryos and protoplanets have been proposed as a key driver of planetary differentiation, core formation, and the delivery of volatile compounds to planetary surfaces. This review synthesizes the current understanding of giant impacts in planet formation, highlighting their role in shaping the architecture of planetary systems. We discuss the evidence for giant impacts, including the presence of impact basins, shocked quartz, and melt rocks on planetary bodies such as the Moon, Vesta, and the asteroid 16 Psyche. We also examine the theoretical frameworks that describe the dynamics of giant impacts, including the role of gravitational interactions, orbital resonances, and the effects of impact-induced melting and re-melting. Furthermore, we explore the implications of giant impacts for planetary differentiation, core formation, and the delivery of volatile compounds, highlighting the complex interplay between these processes. Our review highlights the importance of giant impacts in planet formation, and demonstrates that these high-energy collisions played a critical role in shaping the architecture of planetary systems. The findings of this review have significant implications for our understanding of the early solar system and the formation of planets beyond our solar system."}
