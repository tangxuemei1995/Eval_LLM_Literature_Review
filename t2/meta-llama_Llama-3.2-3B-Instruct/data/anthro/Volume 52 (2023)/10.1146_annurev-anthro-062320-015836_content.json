{"Abstract": "This study undertakes a critical examination of the intersections between feminist practice of archaeology and digital archaeology, with a focus on the construction of the past through autobiographical narratives. Drawing on a middle-range research approach, this investigation explores the ways in which shifting and pivoting viewpoints in Neolithic European prehistory have been influenced by the author's own experiences and inspirations throughout their lifetime. Through a qualitative analysis of autobiographical accounts and digital archaeological projects, this research reveals the complex dynamics between personal and professional perspectives in shaping our understanding of the past. By acknowledging the role of autobiographical narratives in the construction of historical narratives, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the intersections between feminist practice, digital archaeology, and the history of archaeology, ultimately informing more nuanced and contextualized approaches to the study of European prehistory."}
