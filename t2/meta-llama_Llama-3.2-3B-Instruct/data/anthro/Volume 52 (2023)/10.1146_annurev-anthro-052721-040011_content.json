{"Abstract": "This study contributes to the growing body of research on Critical University Studies (CUS), a framework that seeks to decolonize and democratize higher education. Drawing on the intersections of critical pedagogy, Black studies, and abolitionist thought, this research examines the ways in which CUS can be used to challenge dominant power structures and promote social justice within university settings. Through a critical analysis of existing literature and case studies, this study highlights the importance of centering marginalized voices and perspectives in university curricula and pedagogy. It also explores the potential for CUS to inform abolitionist efforts to dismantle the prison-industrial complex and promote a more equitable and just society. Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the transformative potential of Critical University Studies and its role in shaping a more just and equitable future."}
