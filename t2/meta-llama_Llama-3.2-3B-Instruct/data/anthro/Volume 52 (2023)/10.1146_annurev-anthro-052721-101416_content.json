{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex interplay between religious conversion and politics, exploring how individuals and groups navigate the tensions between personal faith and public difference. Through a critical discourse analysis of media reports and policy documents, this research reveals how religious conversion is often framed as a source of political difference, with converts frequently stigmatized or marginalized. Conversely, the study also highlights instances where religious conversion is leveraged as a tool of social change, with individuals and groups using their faith to challenge dominant power structures. By analyzing the intersections of religion, politics, and identity, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the ways in which religious conversion shapes and is shaped by the political landscape. Ultimately, the study aims to shed light on the complex dynamics of making a difference through religious conversion in the context of politics and social change."}
