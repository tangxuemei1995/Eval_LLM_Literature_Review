{"Abstract": "This study undertakes a linguistic anthropology of images, examining the complex interplay between visual representation and linguistic meaning. Through a critical discourse analysis of semiotic images, the research explores the process of entextualization, where images are inscribed with linguistic meaning and become part of a larger discursive field. The findings highlight the performative potential of images, which can enact social norms and reinforce power dynamics. Furthermore, the study reveals the concept of enregisterment, where images are imbued with specific linguistic features and become part of a particular register or genre. The research demonstrates how linguistic anthropology can provide a nuanced understanding of the role of images in shaping social meaning and cultural identity. By examining the intersections of language, image, and power, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between visual representation and linguistic expression."}
