{"Abstract": "The interplay between environmental factors and epigenetic mechanisms has been increasingly recognized as a critical determinant of the pace of human aging. Research has shown that exposure to environmental toxins, lifestyle choices, and socioeconomic conditions can lead to epigenetic alterations that accelerate biological aging. The epigenetic clock, a measure of epigenetic age, has been found to be a strong predictor of age-related disease, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and cognitive decline. Conversely, environmental interventions, such as dietary modifications and exercise, have been shown to slow epigenetic aging and improve health outcomes. This review aims to synthesize the current evidence on the relationship between environment, epigenetics, and aging, highlighting the potential for environmental interventions to modulate epigenetic aging and mitigate age-related disease. Understanding this complex interplay is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to promote healthy aging and prevent age-related disease."}
