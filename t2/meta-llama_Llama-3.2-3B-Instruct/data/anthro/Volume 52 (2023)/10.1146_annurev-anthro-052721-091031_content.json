{"Abstract": "The Pirahã language, spoken in the Amazonian region of Brazil, has been a subject of intense debate in linguistic anthropology and cognitive science. The controversy surrounding Pirahã's unique linguistic features, such as its limited number of color terms and absence of numbers beyond two, has sparked discussions on linguistic diversity and cognitive universality. This study examines the linguistic structure of Pirahã and its implications for our understanding of language faculty and universal grammar. Through a comparative analysis of Pirahã with other indigenous languages of Amazonia, we investigate the extent to which linguistic diversity is compatible with a universal cognitive framework. Our findings suggest that while Pirahã's linguistic features may appear anomalous, they can be understood as a result of cognitive adaptations to its specific environmental context. This research contributes to the ongoing debate on linguistic diversity and cognitive universality, highlighting the complex interplay between language, culture, and cognition in shaping human linguistic expression."}
