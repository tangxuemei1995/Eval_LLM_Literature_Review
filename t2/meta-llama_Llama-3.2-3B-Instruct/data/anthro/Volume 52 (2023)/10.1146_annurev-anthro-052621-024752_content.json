{"Abstract": "This study revisits the notion of Neandertals, a species once relegated to the periphery of human evolution, through a critical examination of the historical and scientific contexts that have shaped our understanding of these enigmatic beings. By analyzing the intersection of 19th-century scientific racism and the discovery of Neandertal fossils, this research highlights the ways in which the uncanny valley phenomenon has influenced the perception of Neandertals as 'other'. Drawing on historical accounts of scientific inquiry and ethnographic observations of symbolic behavior, this study argues that the Neandertals' physical appearance and cultural practices have been subject to a double standard, with their'savage' and 'barbaric' traits simultaneously valorized and dehumanized. By reevaluating the historical and scientific narratives surrounding Neandertals, this research seeks to challenge dominant discourses of human evolution and promote a more nuanced understanding of our shared evolutionary history."}
