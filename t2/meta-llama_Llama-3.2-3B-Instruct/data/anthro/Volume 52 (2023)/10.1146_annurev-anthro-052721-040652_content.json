{"Abstract": "Decolonizing museums is a critical imperative for the preservation and representation of Indigenous cultures and histories. This paradigm shift requires a fundamental transformation of museum practices, moving away from Eurocentric and colonialist narratives to prioritize Native American scholarship and perspectives. By centering Indigenous voices and knowledge, museums can dismantle the power dynamics that have historically marginalized and erased Native American communities. This shift involves not only the repatriation of cultural artifacts and the development of Indigenous-led exhibitions but also a fundamental reevaluation of the role of museums in society. By embracing decolonization and indigenization, museums can become sites of reconciliation, healing, and cultural revitalization, ultimately contributing to a more just and equitable representation of Indigenous peoples and their histories."}
