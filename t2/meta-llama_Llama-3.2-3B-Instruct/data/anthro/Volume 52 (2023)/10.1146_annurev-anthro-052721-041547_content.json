{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of algorithms and ecology, examining the infrastructure and social imaginaries that underpin the development and deployment of smart technologies. Through a critical analysis of existing literature, we identify the interfaces between algorithmic systems and the natural environment, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of the ecological implications of algorithmic decision-making. By investigating the ways in which algorithms shape our relationships with technology and the environment, this research contributes to the emerging field of 'ecology of algorithms,' offering insights into the potential consequences of algorithmic governance on ecological systems and human societies."}
