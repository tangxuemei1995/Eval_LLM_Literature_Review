{"Abstract": "Human bodies have evolved to adapt to diverse environments, but extreme conditions pose significant challenges to thermoregulation, metabolism, and overall survival. This review examines the physiological and biochemical responses of humans in extreme environments, including high-altitude, arctic, and desert conditions. Research highlights the importance of metabolic adaptations, such as increased brown adipose tissue activity, to cope with cold temperatures. In contrast, heat stress triggers heat shock proteins and vasodilation to maintain core temperature. Climate change exacerbates these challenges, particularly for vulnerable populations. Structural inequality in access to resources, healthcare, and infrastructure further exacerbates the disparities in human adaptation to extreme environments. Understanding these adaptations is crucial for developing targeted interventions to mitigate the effects of climate change and promote human resilience in extreme environments."}
