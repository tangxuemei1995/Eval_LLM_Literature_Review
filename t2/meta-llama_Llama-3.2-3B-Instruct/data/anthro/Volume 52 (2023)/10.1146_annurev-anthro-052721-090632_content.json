{"Abstract": "This study examines the concept of biological normalcy in the context of human biology, exploring how cultural norms and statistical variation influence our understanding of what is considered 'normal'. Through a critical analysis of existing literature, we reveal how normative views of human biology are shaped by societal expectations and statistical averages. Our research highlights the limitations of relying solely on statistical data to define biological normalcy, as it neglects the inherent variation and diversity within human populations. By challenging traditional notions of normalcy, this study aims to promote a more nuanced understanding of human biology, one that acknowledges the complexities and variations that exist within and between populations. Ultimately, our findings have implications for how we approach health, medicine, and the human experience, encouraging a more inclusive and accepting definition of biological normalcy."}
