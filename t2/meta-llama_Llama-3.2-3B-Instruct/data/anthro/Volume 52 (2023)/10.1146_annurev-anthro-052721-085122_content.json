{"Abstract": "The intricate relationships between the human gut microbiome and host ecology and evolution have garnered significant attention in recent years. This complex interplay is characterized by dynamic interactions between the microbiota, host immune system, and environmental factors, ultimately influencing phenotypic variation and disease susceptibility. Nonhuman primate models have provided valuable insights into the evolutionary origins of human microbiota and the mechanisms underlying host-microbial co-evolution. Studies have shown that changes in gut microbiota composition are associated with adaptations to different diets, environments, and lifestyles, highlighting the critical role of the microbiome in shaping human health and disease. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the intersections between gut microbial ecology, human ecology, and evolution, with a focus on the nonhuman primate model, to elucidate the complex relationships between the human microbiome and its host environment."}
