{"Abstract": "This study examines the intersection of social movements, power dynamics, and mediated visibility in the digital age. Through a critical discourse analysis of visual media, this research investigates how social movements are represented and perceived by states and corporations. The findings suggest that the strategic deployment of visual media by social movements can amplify their messages, mobilize public support, and challenge dominant power structures. Conversely, the manipulation of visual media by states and corporations can serve to co-opt and silence social movements. The study highlights the complex interplay between visual media, power, and social movements, with implications for social change and resistance."}
