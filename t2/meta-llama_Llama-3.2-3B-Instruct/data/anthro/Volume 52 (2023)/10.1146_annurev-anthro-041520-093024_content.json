{"Abstract": "This study critiques the dominant paradigm of global health interventions, which posits that military-led aid delivery is an effective solution to address health disparities worldwide. Through an anthropological lens, we examine the'magic bullet' approach, where a single intervention is assumed to be the panacea for complex health issues. Our analysis reveals that this deterministic model overlooks the intricate web of social, economic, and cultural factors that shape health outcomes. We argue that a more nuanced understanding of global health interventions is necessary, one that acknowledges the agency of local populations and the need for context-specific solutions. By exploring alternative approaches to global health, including those that prioritize community-led initiatives and participatory governance, we aim to challenge the status quo and foster a more equitable and effective global health agenda."}
