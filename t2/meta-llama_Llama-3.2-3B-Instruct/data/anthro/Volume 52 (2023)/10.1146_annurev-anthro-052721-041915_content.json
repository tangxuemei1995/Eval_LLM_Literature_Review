{"Abstract": "This study revisits the concept of masculinity through an anthropological lens, challenging dominant narratives and reexamining the unmarked assumptions that underpin traditional notions of male identity. Drawing on ethnographic research with men from diverse backgrounds, this work seeks to uncover the complexities and nuances of masculinity, highlighting the ways in which societal expectations and power dynamics shape individual experiences. By exploring the intersections of masculinity with other social categories, such as gender, sexuality, and inequality, this research aims to shed light on the ways in which masculinity is both performed and performed upon. Ultimately, this study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of masculinity as a dynamic and multifaceted construct, one that is subject to change and transformation in response to shifting social and cultural contexts."}
