{"Abstract": "This research explores the intersections of security regimes, imperialism, and transnational entanglements through the lens of political anthropology and transnational feminism. By examining the ways in which security policies are shaped by imperial power dynamics, this study reveals how race and gender are mobilized to maintain and expand imperial control. Through a critical analysis of historical and contemporary case studies, this research demonstrates how security regimes are not only a product of imperial power but also a tool for reinforcing and perpetuating systems of oppression. The findings of this study highlight the need for a transnational feminist approach to security studies, one that centers the experiences and perspectives of marginalized communities and challenges dominant narratives of security and empire. By doing so, this research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between security, empire, and transnational entanglements."}
