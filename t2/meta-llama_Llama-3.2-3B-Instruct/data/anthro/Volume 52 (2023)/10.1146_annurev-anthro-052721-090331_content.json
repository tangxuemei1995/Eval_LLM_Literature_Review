{"Abstract": "This study examines the intricate relationships between water needs, water insecurity, and human biology, with a focus on the embodied experiences of individuals in the face of climate change. Through a mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative data, we investigate how water insecurity affects human hydration and coping strategies. Our findings suggest that water insecurity is closely linked to physiological responses, including increased thirst and dehydration, which can have long-term consequences for human health. We also explore the role of embodiment in shaping individual responses to water insecurity, highlighting the importance of considering the intersection of environmental, social, and biological factors. The study's results have significant implications for understanding the human dimensions of water insecurity and informing strategies to address this pressing global issue, particularly in the context of climate change."}
