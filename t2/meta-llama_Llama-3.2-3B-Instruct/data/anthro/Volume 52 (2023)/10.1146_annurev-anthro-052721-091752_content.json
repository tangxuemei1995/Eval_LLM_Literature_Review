{"Abstract": "This study examines the invisible labor and ethics of interpreting in the context of global capitalism and humanitarian regimes. Through a critical discourse analysis of existing literature and case studies, this research reveals the often-overlooked contributions of interpreters in shaping the narratives and policies of international organizations. The invisible labor of interpreters is characterized by the suppression of their own voice and agency, as they are relegated to the background of decision-making processes. This research highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the power dynamics at play in interpreting, and the importance of recognizing the ethical implications of interpreter labor. By centering the voices and perspectives of interpreters, this study aims to contribute to a more equitable and just global order, one that values the contributions of all individuals involved in interpreting and translation."}
