{"Abstract": "Retinal degeneration is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, with limited treatment options available. Stem cell-based regenerative approaches have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy to replace or repair damaged retinal cells. This review examines the key factors influencing the efficacy of stem cell-based therapies in retinal degeneration, with a focus on the role of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), photoreceptors, ganglion cells, and immune microenvironment. Pluripotent stem cells, derived from embryonic or induced pluripotent sources, have shown potential in replacing RPE cells and promoting photoreceptor regeneration. However, the integration of transplanted stem cells into the host retina is hindered by the immune microenvironment, which must be modulated to prevent rejection and promote engraftment. Understanding the complex interactions between stem cells, RPE, photoreceptors, and immune cells is crucial for the development of effective stem cell-based therapies for retinal degeneration."}
