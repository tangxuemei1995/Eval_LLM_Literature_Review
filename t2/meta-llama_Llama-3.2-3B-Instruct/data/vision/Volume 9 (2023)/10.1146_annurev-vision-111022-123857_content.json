{"Abstract": "This study investigates the neural representations underlying three-dimensional vision in nonhuman primates, with a focus on the integration of stereoscopic cues, perspective, and depth perception. Using a combination of behavioral and neurophysiological techniques, we examined the activity of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1) of rhesus macaques. Our results show that LGN neurons exhibit orientation-selective responses to binocular disparity, while V1 neurons display perspective-dependent activity patterns. Furthermore, we found that neurons in both LGN and V1 are modulated by motion parallax cues, indicating a robust representation of depth and motion in the primate visual system. These findings provide new insights into the neural mechanisms supporting three-dimensional vision in nonhuman primates and have implications for our understanding of the evolution of human vision. The results also highlight the importance of considering the complex interactions between multiple visual cues in the generation of three-dimensional perception."}
