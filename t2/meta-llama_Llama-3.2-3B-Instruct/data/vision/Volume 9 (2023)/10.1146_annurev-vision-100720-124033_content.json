{"Abstract": "This study investigates the role of the cerebral cortex in visual search using natural scenes as stimuli. Rhesus monkeys were presented with complex natural scenes and asked to locate specific objects. Saccadic eye movements were recorded to analyze the neural mechanisms underlying visual search. Results show that the frontal eye field and visual cortex play a crucial role in guiding saccades in natural scenes. Furthermore, the cerebral cortex's ability to integrate visual information from multiple locations enhances visual search efficiency. These findings provide new insights into the neural basis of visual search and have implications for understanding the cognitive processes underlying human visual perception."}
