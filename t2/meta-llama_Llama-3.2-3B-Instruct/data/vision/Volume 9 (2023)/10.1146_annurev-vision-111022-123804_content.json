{"Abstract": "The basal ganglia, a complex neural circuit, plays a crucial role in modulating visual perceptual decisions. Recent studies have employed sequential analysis and signal detection theory to investigate the contributions of the striatum and pallidum to saccadic choices and reaction times. Our analysis reveals that the basal ganglia modulate the accuracy of visual perceptual decisions by influencing the neural representation of sensory information. Specifically, the striatum is involved in the detection of relevant stimuli, while the pallidum modulates the response time. These findings provide new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying visual perceptual decisions and have implications for our understanding of the basal ganglia's role in cognition and behavior."}
