{"Abstract": "This study employs ultra-high field functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate human visual cognition at unprecedented spatial resolution. Utilizing columnar imaging techniques, we mapped cortical layer-specific activity in response to visual stimuli, revealing distinct patterns of neural activation across the visual cortex. Subcortical structures, including the thalamus and basal ganglia, were also imaged to elucidate their contributions to visual processing. Our findings provide novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying visual perception, highlighting the importance of cortical layering and subcortical networks in shaping human visual cognition. These results have significant implications for our understanding of visual processing and the development of more accurate neuroimaging models."}
