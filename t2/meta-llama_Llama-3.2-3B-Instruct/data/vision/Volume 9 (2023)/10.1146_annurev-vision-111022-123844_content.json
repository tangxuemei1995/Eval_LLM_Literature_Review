{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of color vision, motion perception, and autobiographical narrative through the lens of a woman scientist. By examining the life and work of pioneering female researchers in psychophysics, we uncover the complex relationships between hyperacuity, stereopsis, and trajectory motion. The author's own experiences with amblyopia are also woven into the narrative, highlighting the ways in which personal and professional trajectories intersect. Through a qualitative analysis of autobiographical accounts, this research sheds light on the often-overlooked contributions of women to the field of psychophysics and the importance of inclusive representation in scientific discourse."}
