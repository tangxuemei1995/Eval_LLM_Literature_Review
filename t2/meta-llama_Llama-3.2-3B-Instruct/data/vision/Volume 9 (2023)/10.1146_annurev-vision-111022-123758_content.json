{"Abstract": "This study explores the perceptual science of augmented reality, examining how display systems influence visual perception in AR environments. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate the effects of display characteristics on user experience. Results show that display systems can significantly impact AR perception, with differences in display resolution, refresh rate, and color gamut affecting user performance and comfort. The findings highlight the importance of considering display systems in the design of AR applications, particularly in applications requiring high levels of visual fidelity and accuracy. The study contributes to our understanding of the perceptual science of AR, providing insights for the development of more effective and user-friendly AR systems."}
