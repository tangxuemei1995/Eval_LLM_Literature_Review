{"Abstract": "The increasing reliance on mobile devices has created a vast array of assistive technologies that can enhance the lives of visually impaired individuals. This study examines the impact of mobile apps as assistive devices for visually impaired persons, with a focus on vision rehabilitation and accessibility. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that mobile apps can provide a range of benefits, including improved navigation, enhanced communication, and increased independence. Apps such as VoiceOver, TalkBack, and Be My Eyes have been shown to facilitate daily tasks, such as reading, writing, and social interaction. Furthermore, mobile apps can also provide access to a wealth of information and educational resources, promoting lifelong learning and skill development. However, the effectiveness of these apps is often hindered by limitations in accessibility, including inadequate screen reader functionality and lack of tactile feedback. To address these challenges, this study proposes a framework for developing accessible mobile apps that cater to the needs of visually impaired individuals. The proposed framework emphasizes the importance of user-centered design, accessibility standards, and ongoing evaluation and testing. By promoting the use of mobile apps as assistive devices, this study aims to improve the quality of life for visually impaired persons and promote greater inclusivity in the digital age."}
