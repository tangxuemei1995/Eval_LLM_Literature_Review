{"Abstract": "Eye morphogenesis in vertebrates is a complex and highly regulated process involving the coordinated development of multiple cell types and tissues. The formation of the optic cup, a critical structure in the development of the eye, is initiated by the interaction of neural crest cells and the surface ectoderm. The optic cup then undergoes a series of morphogenetic movements and cellular differentiation, giving rise to the lens, retina, and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The lens, composed of crystalline cells, is formed through the invagination of the optic cup and undergoes a process of cell differentiation and compaction to produce the transparent, refractive lens. The retina, comprising photoreceptor cells, bipolar cells, and ganglion cells, develops from the inner layer of the optic cup and is characterized by the formation of the retinal pigment epithelium, a monolayer of pigmented cells that provides essential support and nutrition to the photoreceptors. Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying eye morphogenesis is crucial for elucidating the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to eye development and disease, including congenital anomalies and retinal degeneration."}
