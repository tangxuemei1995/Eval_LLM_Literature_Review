{"Abstract": "This study explores the concept of efficient and predictive neural coding in the context of visual perception. By leveraging the principles of information bottleneck theory, we investigate the neural mechanisms underlying efficient coding in the visual cortex. Our results demonstrate that efficient coding is not only a means of reducing information transmission but also a predictive process that enables the brain to anticipate and prepare for upcoming visual stimuli. Furthermore, we show that this predictive coding framework can be used to improve the efficiency of neural coding, leading to more accurate and robust visual perception. The findings of this study have significant implications for our understanding of the neural basis of vision and the development of more efficient and effective neural coding strategies."}
