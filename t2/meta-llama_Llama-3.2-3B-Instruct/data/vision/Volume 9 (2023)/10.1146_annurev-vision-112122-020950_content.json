{"Abstract": "Aging is a complex and multifaceted process that affects various retinal structures and functions, leading to age-related macular degeneration and vision loss. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the structural and molecular changes that occur in the retina during aging, with a focus on synaptic dysfunction and neuronal degeneration. The retina's complex molecular landscape, including the organization of photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and ganglion cells, is disrupted with age, resulting in impaired synaptic transmission and neuronal connectivity. The loss of synapses and the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are hallmarks of aging retinal neurons. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat age-related retinal diseases. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge on the structure, function, and molecular landscapes of the aging retina, highlighting the need for further research in this area."}
