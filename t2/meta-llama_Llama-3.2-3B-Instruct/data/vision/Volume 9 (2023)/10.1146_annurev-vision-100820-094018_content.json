{"Abstract": "Nonvisual opsins, traditionally associated with phototransduction in the retina, have emerged as crucial components in extraocular light sensing physiology. Recent studies have elucidated the role of these proteins in detecting ambient light and modulating the circadian clock. The expansion of nonvisual opsins' functional repertoire has significant implications for our understanding of light-metabolism interactions and the regulation of physiological processes. In this context, the discovery of novel nonvisual opsin genes and their expression patterns in extraocular tissues has provided new insights into the evolution of light sensing mechanisms. Furthermore, the functional characterization of these proteins has revealed their capacity to influence metabolic pathways, including glucose and lipid metabolism, thereby underscoring the intricate relationships between light, metabolism, and overall physiological homeostasis. This review aims to consolidate the current knowledge on nonvisual opsins in extraocular light sensing and their far-reaching consequences for our understanding of physiological processes."}
