{"Abstract": "Photoreceptor degenerative disorders, such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration, are characterized by progressive vision loss and blindness. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of retinal remodeling in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Retinal remodeling involves the reorganization of retinal circuits, leading to the loss of photoreceptor function and synaptic connections. To mitigate vision loss, suppressing retinal remodeling is a promising therapeutic strategy. This review aims to discuss the current understanding of retinal remodeling in photoreceptor degenerative disorders, with a focus on synaptic plasticity and its role in retinal circuit reorganization. We also explore the potential therapeutic approaches to suppress retinal remodeling, including pharmacological and optogenetic interventions. By understanding the mechanisms underlying retinal remodeling, we can develop novel treatments to preserve photoreceptor function and prevent vision loss in these devastating disorders."}
