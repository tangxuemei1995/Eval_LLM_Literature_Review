{"Abstract": "This study investigates the neural correlates of visual representations through multivariate pattern analysis and neural decoding techniques. By analyzing the activity patterns in the brain's visual cortex, we uncover the internal representations of objects and their relationships. Our results demonstrate that the neural dynamics of object perception are characterized by a complex interplay between different brain regions, giving rise to a rich representational structure. The decoding analysis reveals that the brain's neural activity can be used to reconstruct the internal representations of objects, providing insights into the neural mechanisms underlying object recognition. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the neural dynamics of object perception are influenced by the object's internal structure and its relationships with other objects in the environment. These results contribute to our understanding of the neural basis of visual representations and have implications for the development of more accurate brain-computer interfaces and artificial intelligence systems."}
