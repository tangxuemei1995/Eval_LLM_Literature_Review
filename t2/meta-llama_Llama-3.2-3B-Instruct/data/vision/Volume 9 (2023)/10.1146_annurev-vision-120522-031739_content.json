{"Abstract": "The increasing success of deep neural networks in various visual perception tasks has led to their widespread adoption as behavioral models of human visual perception. However, the adequacy of these models remains a topic of debate. This review synthesizes the current state of research on the strengths and limitations of deep neural networks in modeling human visual perception, with a focus on object recognition. We examine the empirical evidence supporting the use of deep neural networks in visual psychophysics, including their ability to replicate human performance in tasks such as object recognition and feature extraction. We also discuss the limitations of these models, including their reliance on large amounts of training data and their failure to capture the underlying cognitive mechanisms of human visual perception. Ultimately, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of deep neural networks in modeling human visual perception and to identify areas for future research in this field."}
