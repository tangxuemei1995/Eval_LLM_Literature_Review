{"Abstract": "Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of blindness in premature infants, characterized by abnormal angiogenesis and vascularization in the developing retina. The pathophysiology of ROP involves complex interactions between maternal-fetal factors, including oxygen exposure, growth factors, and cell signaling pathways. Research has shown that excessive oxygen levels in the womb can stimulate angiogenic factors, leading to excessive vascularization and retinal detachment. Growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), play a crucial role in this process, while alterations in cell signaling pathways, including the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways, contribute to the development of ROP. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for the development of effective therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat ROP."}
