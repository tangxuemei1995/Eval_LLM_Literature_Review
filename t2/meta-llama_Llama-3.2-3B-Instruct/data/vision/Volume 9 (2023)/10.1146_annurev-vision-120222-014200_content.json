{"Abstract": "The ventral visual stream and medial temporal lobe play crucial roles in the processing and storage of visual information, with a significant impact on perception and memory. Research has shown that the ventral visual stream, particularly the perirhinal cortex, is involved in the formation and retrieval of episodic memories, while the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, is essential for the consolidation of new information into long-term memory. Studies utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) have demonstrated that the ventral visual stream and medial temporal lobe exhibit synchronized activity during visual perception and memory tasks, suggesting a close relationship between these brain regions. This abstract reviews the current literature on the neural mechanisms underlying perception and memory in the ventral visual stream and medial temporal lobe, highlighting the importance of these regions in the formation and retrieval of visual memories."}
