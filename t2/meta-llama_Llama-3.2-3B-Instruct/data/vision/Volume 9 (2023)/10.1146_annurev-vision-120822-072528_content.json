{"Abstract": "Predicting visual fixations is a fundamental problem in computer vision and neuroscience, with applications in human-computer interaction, visual attention, and cognitive psychology. This study presents a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art in visual fixation prediction, highlighting the key challenges, methodologies, and findings. We provide a unifying framework that integrates information-theoretic and machine learning approaches, including saliency models, eye movement analysis, and transfer learning. Our analysis reveals that saliency-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in benchmarking datasets, but often rely on task-specific features and suffer from limited transferability. In contrast, models incorporating eye movement analysis and information-theoretic measures have shown promising results in predicting fixations across different tasks and datasets. We propose a novel taxonomy of visual fixation prediction methods, categorizing them into three main groups: saliency-based, eye movement-based, and hybrid approaches. Our findings highlight the need for a more unified framework that can effectively leverage the strengths of each approach. By providing a comprehensive review and a unifying framework, this study aims to facilitate future research in visual fixation prediction and promote the development of more accurate and transferable models."}
