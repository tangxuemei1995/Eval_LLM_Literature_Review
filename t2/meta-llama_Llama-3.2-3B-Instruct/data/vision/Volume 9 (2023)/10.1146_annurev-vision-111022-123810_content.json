{"Abstract": "Visual dysfunction is a common complication of diabetes, affecting millions of individuals worldwide. This condition is characterized by damage to the retina, leading to impaired visual acuity and increased risk of blindness. Research in both human and animal models has elucidated the underlying physiological mechanisms contributing to visual dysfunction in diabetes. Studies using rodent models, including mice and rats, have demonstrated that hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress and inflammation disrupt retinal neuronal function, resulting in photoreceptor degeneration and visual impairment. In contrast, human studies have shown that diabetic retinopathy is associated with altered retinal blood flow, increased vascular permeability, and impaired neuronal survival. Understanding the complex interplay between diabetes, retinal physiology, and visual function is crucial for the development of effective therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat visual dysfunction in diabetes."}
