{"Abstract": "The primate superior colliculus (SC) plays a crucial role in the integration of visual information to facilitate efficient and adaptive eye movements. This complex structure, located in the midbrain, is responsible for the orienting response, a rapid and automatic shift in attention to detect and track visual stimuli. Recent studies have elucidated the neural mechanisms underlying the visual functions of the SC, highlighting its involvement in the processing of motion, depth, and spatial attention. The SC's ability to modulate eye movements in real-time enables active vision, allowing primates to selectively focus on relevant visual information while ignoring irrelevant stimuli. This abstract reviews the current understanding of the visual functions of the primate SC, with a focus on its role in guiding eye movements and facilitating adaptive vision. The findings have significant implications for our understanding of primate visual processing and the neural mechanisms underlying attention and eye movement control."}
