{"Abstract": "Emerging pathogenic viral infections of the eye pose significant threats to global public health. This review highlights the recent surge in viral infections causing uveitis and other ophthalmic manifestations, including COVID-19 and Ebola virus disease. Viral persistence and reactivation have been implicated in the development of ocular complications. The literature reveals a range of viral pathogens, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, and flaviviruses, capable of inducing severe ocular inflammation and damage. Understanding the mechanisms of viral persistence and the pathogenesis of ophthalmic manifestations is crucial for the development of effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Early detection and treatment are essential to prevent long-term vision loss and blindness."}
