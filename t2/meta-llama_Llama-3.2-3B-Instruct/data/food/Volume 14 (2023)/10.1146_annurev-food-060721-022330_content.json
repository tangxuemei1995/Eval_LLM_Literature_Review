{"Abstract": "Mechano-bactericidal surfaces have emerged as a promising approach to prevent microbial contamination in food processing and packaging. These surfaces utilize mechanical stress to induce bactericidal effects, reducing the risk of foodborne illnesses. Nanofabrication techniques enable the creation of tailored surface structures and properties, enhancing antimicrobial activity. This review explores the mechanisms underlying mechano-bactericidal surfaces, recent advances in nanofabrication, and their potential applications in food processing and packaging, highlighting the prospects for improving food safety and reducing antimicrobial resistance."}
