{"Abstract": "Nondigestible functional oligosaccharides, particularly prebiotics, have garnered significant attention for their potential to promote intestinal health. This review focuses on the enzymatic production of functional oligosaccharides and their applications in food products. The synthesis of prebiotic oligosaccharides via enzymatic reactions, such as glycosidase-catalyzed hydrolysis, has been explored. The resulting oligosaccharides exhibit prebiotic effects, including the stimulation of beneficial gut microbiota and the enhancement of immune system function. Food applications of these oligosaccharides have been demonstrated, including their incorporation into dairy products, baked goods, and beverages. The prebiotic effects of these oligosaccharides have been shown to improve gut health, modulate the immune system, and even influence metabolic disorders. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of research on functional oligosaccharides, highlighting their potential as a valuable tool for promoting intestinal health and well-being."}
