{"Abstract": "The INFOGEST in vitro digestion model is a widely used tool for simulating the digestion and absorption of nutrients in the gastrointestinal tract. This review aims to provide an overview of the applications of the INFOGEST model to various foods, including functional foods. The model has been extensively validated and has been used to study the bioavailability and bioaccessibility of nutrients in foods. The effects of food matrix, processing, and cooking on nutrient digestion and absorption have been investigated using the INFOGEST model. The results have shown that the model can accurately predict the bioavailability of nutrients in foods, including vitamins, minerals, and proteins. The INFOGEST model has also been used to study the functional properties of foods, such as prebiotic and probiotic effects. Overall, the INFOGEST model is a valuable tool for researchers and food manufacturers to evaluate the nutritional quality of foods and to develop functional foods with improved nutritional profiles."}
