{"Abstract": "This comprehensive review examines the application of nanoparticles in oral delivery of food ingredients, focusing on their biological fate, evaluation models, and influences on gut microbiota. Nanoparticles have emerged as a promising tool for enhancing the bioavailability and efficacy of food compounds, particularly in the context of functional foods and nutraceuticals. The review discusses the various types of nanoparticles used in oral delivery, including liposomes, nanoparticles, and nanoemulsions, and their corresponding advantages and limitations. Evaluation models, such as in vitro and in vivo studies, are also critically evaluated to assess the efficacy and safety of nanoparticles in oral delivery. Furthermore, the review highlights the impact of nanoparticles on gut microbiota, including their potential to modulate the gut microbiome and influence nutrient absorption. The findings of this review provide a framework for the development of nanoparticles for oral delivery in food, and highlight the need for further research to fully elucidate their biological fate and microbiota influences."}
