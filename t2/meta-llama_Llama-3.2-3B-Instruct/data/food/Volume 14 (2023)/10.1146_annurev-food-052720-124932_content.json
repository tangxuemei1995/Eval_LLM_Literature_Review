{"Abstract": "This study investigates the molecular changes of meat proteins during processing and their impact on quality and nutritional values. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that various processing techniques, such as grinding, chopping, and cooking, can alter the structure and function of meat proteins. These changes can lead to a loss of nutritional value, increased health risks, and compromised meat quality. The study highlights the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes and developing strategies to mitigate their effects. The findings have significant implications for the meat industry, public health, and consumer choice, emphasizing the need for sustainable and responsible meat processing practices."}
