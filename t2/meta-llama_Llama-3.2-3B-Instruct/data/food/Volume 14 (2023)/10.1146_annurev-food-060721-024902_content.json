{"Abstract": "Ferritin, a protein that stores iron, exhibits dual functions in both animals and plants, with its holo form facilitating iron supplementation and its apo form serving as a delivery system. In animals, holo ferritin, containing iron, plays a crucial role in maintaining iron homeostasis and supporting various physiological processes. Conversely, apo ferritin, lacking iron, has been shown to enhance the delivery of therapeutic agents, such as drugs and genes, to target tissues. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of apo ferritin as a versatile carrier for iron supplementation and drug delivery, offering a promising approach for treating iron-deficiency anemia and other diseases. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of ferritin's dual functions and its applications in iron supplementation and delivery systems, highlighting the potential for apo ferritin as a valuable therapeutic tool."}
