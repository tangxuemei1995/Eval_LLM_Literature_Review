{"Abstract": "Bovine colostrum, the first milk produced by cows after calving, has garnered significant attention for its potential benefits in both veterinary and human health applications. This critical review examines the bioactive proteins, immunoglobulins, and functional properties of bovine colostrum, highlighting its immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. The literature reveals its efficacy in supporting animal health, particularly in the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal disorders, as well as its potential human health benefits, including enhanced immune function and reduced inflammation. The review also discusses the challenges and limitations of utilizing bovine colostrum in human health applications, emphasizing the need for further research and standardization."}
