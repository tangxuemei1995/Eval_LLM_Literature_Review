{"Abstract": "Ergothioneine, a sulfur-containing amino acid, has garnered significant attention for its potent antioxidant properties. This compound plays a crucial role in cytoprotection, particularly in the context of mitochondrial function. The OCTN1 transporter is essential for the uptake of ergothioneine into cells, where it exerts anti-inflammatory effects and mitigates oxidative stress. Research has demonstrated that ergothioneine's antioxidant activity is closely linked to its ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species and protect against mitochondrial damage. Furthermore, studies have shown that ergothioneine's anti-inflammatory properties are mediated through the inhibition of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. Overall, the unique antioxidant profile of ergothioneine, facilitated by the OCTN1 transporter, underscores its potential as a therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of oxidative stress-related disorders."}
