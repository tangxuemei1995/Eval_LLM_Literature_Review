{"Abstract": "This study focuses on the development of nutritionally improved edible plant oils through metabolic engineering. By introducing high oleic acid pathways and reducing levels of linoleic acid (LC-PUFA), these oils exhibit enhanced shelf life and improved fatty acid profiles. Additionally, the incorporation of plant sterols and carotenoids enhances cholesterol-lowering and antioxidant properties. Gene editing technologies enable precise control over oil composition, allowing for tailored nutritional profiles. The integration of vitamin E and other essential nutrients further enhances the health benefits of these engineered oils. These innovations have significant implications for the food industry and public health."}
