{"Abstract": "Bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, have been increasingly recognized as a significant factor in the dairy industry, particularly in food fermentations. The presence of phages can lead to phage-host interactions, resulting in the degradation of fermented products and economic losses for dairy manufacturers. Recent studies have investigated the mechanisms of phage resistance, including conjugation, which enables phages to transfer genes between bacterial strains, thereby conferring resistance. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of phage-bacterium interactions in dairy fermentations, with a focus on phage resistance mechanisms. The findings suggest that phage resistance is a complex trait influenced by multiple factors, including phage-host interactions, conjugation, and environmental factors. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for the development of strategies to mitigate phage-related losses in the dairy industry, ultimately leading to the solution of this long-standing problem."}
