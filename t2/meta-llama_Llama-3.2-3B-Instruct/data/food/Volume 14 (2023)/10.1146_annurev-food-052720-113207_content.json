{"Abstract": "Microbubbles have emerged as a promising technology in food processing, offering enhanced food safety, improved nutritional content, and increased sustainability. The incorporation of microbubbles into food products can improve texture, flavor, and shelf life, while also reducing the need for additives and preservatives. This technology has significant implications for food security, particularly in developing countries where access to nutritious food is limited. Microbubbles can also enhance the bioavailability of nutrients, making them more easily absorbed by the body. Furthermore, the use of microbubbles in food production can reduce waste and minimize environmental impact. As a novel food technology, microbubbles have the potential to revolutionize the way we produce and consume food, ensuring a more sustainable and secure food supply for future generations."}
