{"Abstract": "The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in modulating the response to dietary fiber interventions, with prebiotics serving as a key tool for influencing microbial composition and function. This review highlights the opportunities for personalized approaches to dietary fiber interventions, leveraging the unique characteristics of an individual's gut microbiome to optimize health outcomes. Recent advances in CAZyme analysis have enabled the identification of specific microbial enzymes associated with improved responses to dietary fiber. By tailoring prebiotic supplementation to an individual's unique gut microbiome, it is possible to modulate the gut microbiome and enhance the beneficial effects of dietary fiber. This personalized approach has the potential to improve the efficacy of dietary fiber interventions, leading to enhanced health benefits and reduced risk of chronic diseases. Further research is needed to fully realize the potential of precision nutrition in the context of dietary fiber interventions."}
