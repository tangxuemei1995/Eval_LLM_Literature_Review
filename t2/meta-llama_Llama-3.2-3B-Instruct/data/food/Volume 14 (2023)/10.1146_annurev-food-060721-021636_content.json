{"Abstract": "Phenolic antioxidants play a crucial role in stabilizing emulsions and preventing lipid oxidation, particularly at the oilâ€“water interface. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of targeting the interfacial location of these antioxidants to enhance their efficacy. This review aims to summarize the current strategies for targeting phenolic antioxidants at the emulsion interface, including the design of phenolipids and the use of surfactants and emulsifiers. The benefits of these approaches, including improved antioxidant reservoirs and enhanced stability, are discussed. Additionally, the impact of interfacial location on the antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds is examined, and the potential applications of these strategies in food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries are explored. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on targeting phenolic antioxidants in emulsions and highlights the potential for future research in this area."}
