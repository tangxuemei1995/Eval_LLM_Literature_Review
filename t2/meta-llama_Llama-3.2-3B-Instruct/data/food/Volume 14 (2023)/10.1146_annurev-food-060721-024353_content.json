{"Abstract": "The increasing global demand for sustainable and nutritious food sources has led to a growing interest in biotechnology for the production of future food lipids. Microbial lipids, such as those produced through metabolic engineering of microorganisms, offer a promising alternative to traditional lipid sources. Enzymatic modification of microbial lipids can enhance their nutritional and functional properties, including improved digestibility and increased bioavailability. Structural lipids, such as phospholipids, are also being engineered for specific applications in food and pharmaceutical industries. However, the production of these lipids is often limited by factors such as scalability, cost, and regulatory frameworks. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of biotechnology in future food lipids, highlighting opportunities and challenges in the production, processing, and application of microbial lipids. The potential of biotechnology to address the complex challenges facing the food industry is discussed, including sustainability, nutrition, and food security."}
