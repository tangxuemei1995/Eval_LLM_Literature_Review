{"Abstract": "The enzymatic modification of starch has emerged as a promising approach to enhance its functionality in various applications. This review focuses on the recent advancements in enzymatic strategies for structuring starch, with a particular emphasis on the molecular structure and its relationship with functionality. Enzymes such as alpha-amylase, glucoamylase, and starch synthases have been explored for their ability to modify the starch granule structure, leading to improved digestibility, texture, and rheological properties. The application of these enzymes in food processing, pharmaceuticals, and biotechnology has been demonstrated to produce starch-based products with enhanced functionality. For instance, the enzymatic hydrolysis of starch can produce maltodextrins with improved solubility and bioavailability. Furthermore, the use of starch synthases has been shown to produce starches with tailored molecular structures, enabling the creation of novel starch-based materials with specific properties. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of the art in enzymatic starch modification, highlighting the potential applications and future directions of this technology."}
