{"Abstract": "The Genebank collections, a vast repository of plant genetic resources, hold immense potential for uncovering novel metabolic signatures that can inform human health. Natural variation in plant metabolomics has been increasingly recognized as a valuable source of phytonutrients, which are essential for maintaining optimal nutrition and preventing chronic diseases. Recent advances in metabolomics technologies have enabled the comprehensive analysis of plant metabolite profiles, revealing a wealth of information on the biochemical pathways and molecular mechanisms underlying plant metabolism. This study aims to explore the underexploited resource of Genebank collections for human health applications, focusing on the identification of phytonutrient-rich plant varieties and their potential health benefits. By integrating plant metabolomics with nutritional and epidemiological data, we aim to elucidate the metabolic signatures of Genebank collections and their relevance to human health, ultimately contributing to the development of novel dietary interventions and preventive strategies for chronic diseases."}
