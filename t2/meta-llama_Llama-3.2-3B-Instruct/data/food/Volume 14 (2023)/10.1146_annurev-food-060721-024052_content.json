{"Abstract": "Mild fractionation is a novel approach to enhance the sustainability of food ingredients by optimizing the separation of plant proteins. This method combines mild wet separation techniques with dry fractionation to minimize energy consumption and preserve the functional properties of the resulting fractions. The use of mild wet separation allows for the efficient separation of proteins from other components, while dry fractionation enables the concentration of specific protein fractions. The resulting fractions exhibit improved functionality, including enhanced emulsification, gelation, and foaming properties. Compared to traditional fractionation methods, mild fractionation reduces resource use efficiency by up to 30% and minimizes the generation of waste. The application of mild fractionation to plant proteins has the potential to transform the food industry's approach to sustainable ingredient production, enabling the creation of more environmentally friendly and nutritious food products."}
