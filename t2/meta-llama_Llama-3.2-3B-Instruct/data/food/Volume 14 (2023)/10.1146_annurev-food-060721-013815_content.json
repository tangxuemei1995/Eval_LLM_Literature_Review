{"Abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in the food industry has the potential to significantly enhance food safety by identifying potential risks and anomalies in the supply chain. Machine learning algorithms can be trained on large datasets to detect patterns and anomalies in food production, processing, and distribution, enabling early warning systems for potential contamination. Computer vision technology can be employed to inspect food products for visible defects and contaminants, reducing the need for manual inspections. Predictive analytics can forecast the likelihood of foodborne illnesses, allowing for targeted interventions and resource allocation. This study examines the application of AI in improving food safety, with a focus on its potential to reduce foodborne illnesses and protect public health. The findings suggest that AI can be a valuable tool in the fight against foodborne illnesses, and its integration into food safety protocols is essential for ensuring the safety of the global food supply."}
