{"Abstract": "Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a naturally occurring glucosinolate found in cruciferous vegetables, has been extensively studied for its potential health benefits. Upon hydrolysis, I3C is converted to 3,3â€²-diindolylmethane (DIM), a potent bioactive compound with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-cancer properties. This review aims to summarize the occurrence, health-beneficial properties, and cellular/molecular mechanisms of indole-3-carbinol. The occurrence of I3C and DIM in various plant species and their bioavailability in human tissues are discussed. The review also explores the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities of DIM, including its effects on cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and gene expression. The potential therapeutic applications of indole-3-carbinol and its derivatives are also discussed, highlighting the need for further research to fully elucidate their mechanisms of action and potential health benefits."}
