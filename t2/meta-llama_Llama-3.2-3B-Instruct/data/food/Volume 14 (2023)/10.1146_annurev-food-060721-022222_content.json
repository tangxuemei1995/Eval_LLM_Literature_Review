{"Abstract": "The characterization of molecular structure and function of food proteins is crucial for understanding their nutritional and functional properties. Bioinformatic approaches have emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing and predicting protein structure and function. This review highlights the application of bioinformatics techniques, including protein modeling and computational biology, in characterizing the molecular structure and function of food proteins. By integrating data from various sources, including genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, bioinformatic methods enable the prediction of protein function, identification of functional motifs, and analysis of protein-ligand interactions. The application of data science techniques, such as machine learning and network analysis, further enhances the understanding of protein function and interactions. This review aims to provide an overview of the current bioinformatic approaches for characterizing molecular structure and function of food proteins, and to highlight their potential for improving food protein research and development."}
