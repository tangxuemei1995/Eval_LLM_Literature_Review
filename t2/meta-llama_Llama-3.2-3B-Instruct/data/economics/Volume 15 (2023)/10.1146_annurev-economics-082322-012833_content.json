{"Abstract": "This study examines the interplay between micro propagation and macro aggregation in production networks, with a focus on aggregate productivity and misallocation. We investigate how the propagation of technological advancements and market trends from small firms to large firms affects aggregate productivity, and whether this process is accompanied by misallocation of resources. Our analysis reveals that micro propagation can lead to increased aggregate productivity, but also to misallocation of resources, as small firms may not be able to fully capture the benefits of technological advancements. We discuss the implications of these findings for production networks and policy interventions aimed at promoting aggregate productivity and reducing misallocation."}
