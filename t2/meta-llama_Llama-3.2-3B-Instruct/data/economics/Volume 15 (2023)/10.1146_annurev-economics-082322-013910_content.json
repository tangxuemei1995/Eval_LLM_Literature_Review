{"Abstract": "This paper provides an in-depth exploration of non-CES (Constant Elasticity of Substitution) aggregators, a class of economic models that depart from the traditional CES production function. We examine the implications of non-homothetic preferences on aggregator behavior, highlighting the distinction between essentials and inessentials. Our analysis reveals that non-CES aggregators can capture the nuances of implicit additivity and gross substitutes/gross complements, allowing for a more accurate representation of real-world production processes. By shedding light on the properties of non-CES aggregators, we contribute to a deeper understanding of the relationships between production, preferences, and aggregation. The findings have significant implications for macroeconomic modeling, trade theory, and empirical analysis, providing a more comprehensive framework for understanding the behavior of economic agents and systems."}
