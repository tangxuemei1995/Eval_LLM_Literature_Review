{"Abstract": "This study examines the impact of corporate taxation on multinational companies during economic crises. Analyzing tax incidence and its effects on corporate behavior, the research reveals that tax rates have a significant influence on the location of multinational companies. The findings suggest that during economic crises, tax policies can either exacerbate or mitigate the negative consequences of economic downturns on multinational companies. The study contributes to the understanding of the complex relationships between corporate taxation, tax incidence, and economic crises, highlighting the need for policymakers to consider these factors when designing tax policies."}
