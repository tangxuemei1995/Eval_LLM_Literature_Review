{"Abstract": "This study examines the regulation of collusion, a complex phenomenon that can undermine fair market competition. Drawing on Twombly v. Antwerp World Exposition, Inc. (1979), we analyze the burden of proof in establishing collusion and the role of safe tests in identifying collusive behavior. Our research also explores the application of consent orders as a tool for regulating collusion, with a focus on the challenges posed by the increasing use of artificial intelligence in market interactions. Effective regulation is crucial to preventing and mitigating the negative consequences of collusion."}
