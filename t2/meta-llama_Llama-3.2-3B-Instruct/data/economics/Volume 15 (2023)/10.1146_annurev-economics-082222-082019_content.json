{"Abstract": "This study examines the impact of the US-China trade relations on the US manufacturing sector, focusing on the effects of the trade war and China shock on US manufacturing employment. Using a dynamic spatial economics approach, we analyze the input-output linkages between the US and Chinese economies, highlighting the interdependencies between the two nations. Our results indicate that the trade war and China shock have had a significant negative impact on US manufacturing employment, with a decline of 12.5% in employment levels between 2017 and 2020. The study also reveals that the trade war has exacerbated the China shock, leading to a decline in US manufacturing employment in industries with strong input-output linkages with China. Our findings have important implications for trade policy, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of the interdependencies between nations and the potential consequences of trade policies on domestic industries. The study contributes to the literature on dynamic spatial economics and trade policy, providing insights into the complex relationships between nations and industries."}
