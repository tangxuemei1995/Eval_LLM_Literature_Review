{"Abstract": "This review examines the evolution of China's financial system and economy, with a focus on the country's economic reform and development trajectory. Since the introduction of economic reforms in 1978, China has undergone significant transformations, driven by the government's implicit guarantee of financial stability and the integration of financial markets. The review highlights the key milestones in China's economic development, including the establishment of state-owned enterprises, the emergence of private sector companies, and the growth of financial markets. The role of fintech in facilitating financial inclusion and deepening financial markets is also discussed. The review concludes by analyzing the implications of China's financial system and economy on its development trajectory, including the potential risks and opportunities arising from the increasing integration of financial markets and the growing influence of fintech. The findings of this review provide valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners seeking to understand China's unique economic development model."}
