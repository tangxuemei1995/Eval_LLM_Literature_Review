{"Abstract": "This study investigates the econometrics of nonlinear budget sets using a random utility model framework. We employ budget set regression to estimate the relationship between individual characteristics and budget constraints, accounting for bunching effects and endogeneity. Instrumental variables are used to address the endogeneity of budget constraints, allowing for a more accurate estimation of the budget set. Our results show that the estimated budget set exhibits nonlinear relationships with individual characteristics, highlighting the importance of considering nonlinearity in budget set analysis. The findings have implications for understanding consumer behavior and policy interventions aimed at improving financial well-being."}
