{"Abstract": "This study investigates the impact of negotiation training interventions on reducing the gender gap in bargaining outcomes. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative data from a sample of 150 participants. The results show that women who received negotiation training exhibited significant improvements in their bargaining skills, particularly in terms of assertiveness and transparency. Notably, the use of salary history and transparent communication strategies were found to be effective in bridging the gap. In contrast, interventions that focused solely on 'leaning in' or adopting a more assertive tone were less effective. The findings suggest that a comprehensive approach to negotiation training, incorporating strategies that promote transparency and equal communication, is necessary to address the persistent gender gap in bargaining outcomes. The implications of these results have important implications for organizational interventions aimed at promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace."}
