{"Abstract": "This study examines the intersection of cultural transmission and institutional evolution, exploring the economic mechanisms underlying the spread of cultural practices and the formation of social norms. By integrating insights from evolutionary game theory and institutional economics, we analyze the dynamics of cultural transmission and its impact on institutional development, shedding light on the complex relationships between culture, institutions, and economic outcomes."}
