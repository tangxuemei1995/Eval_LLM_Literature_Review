{"Abstract": "This study examines the economics of border carbon adjustment, a policy mechanism that compensates for carbon at the border to mitigate carbon leakage and promote a level playing field among countries. The rationale for border carbon adjustment is rooted in the concept of carbon leakage, where domestic industries relocate to countries with less stringent climate policies, resulting in increased greenhouse gas emissions. By imposing a carbon tariff or adjustment, countries can offset the costs of complying with international climate agreements and maintain competitiveness. The impacts of border carbon adjustment are multifaceted, including increased revenue for governments, reduced carbon emissions, and potential job losses in industries vulnerable to carbon leakage. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the economic and environmental implications of border carbon adjustment, highlighting its potential as a key strategy in the global transition to a low-carbon economy."}
