{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of text algorithms in economics, leveraging advances in natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By treating text data as a valuable source of information, we employ topic models and word embeddings to uncover hidden patterns and relationships in economic texts. Large language models and transformer models are utilized to analyze and generate text, enabling the extraction of insights from vast amounts of economic data. The findings of this research demonstrate the potential of text algorithms in economics, offering new avenues for data-driven decision-making and policy analysis."}
