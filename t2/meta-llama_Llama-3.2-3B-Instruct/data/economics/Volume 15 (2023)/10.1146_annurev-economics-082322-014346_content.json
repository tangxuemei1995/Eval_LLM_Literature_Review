{"Abstract": "The Economics of Digital Privacy explores the complex interplay between individual privacy concerns and the broader economic implications of digital data collection and usage. This study examines the concept of data externalities, where the benefits of digital data collection are shared by multiple parties, while the costs of privacy infringement are borne by individuals. The authors analyze the current state of privacy regulation, highlighting the limitations and challenges of existing frameworks in addressing the growing concerns around digital privacy. Through a mixed-methods approach, combining econometric analysis and case studies, this research identifies key drivers of digital privacy, including data monetization, algorithmic bias, and social media platforms' business models. The findings suggest that a more nuanced understanding of data externalities and privacy regulation is necessary to develop effective policies that balance individual privacy with economic growth and innovation."}
