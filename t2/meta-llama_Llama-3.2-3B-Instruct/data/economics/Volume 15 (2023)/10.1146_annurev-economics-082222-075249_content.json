{"Abstract": "This study examines the organizational structure and dynamics of social enterprises, a growing sector of nonprofit organizations that aim to address social and environmental issues while generating economic returns. Through a mixed-methods approach combining survey research and case studies, we investigate the organizational characteristics, governance models, and operational strategies of social enterprises. Our findings highlight the diversity of social enterprises, with varying levels of social and economic impact, and reveal the importance of effective governance, stakeholder engagement, and adaptive management in achieving their mission. The study contributes to the existing literature on social entrepreneurship and nonprofit management, providing insights into the organizational organization and performance of social enterprises."}
