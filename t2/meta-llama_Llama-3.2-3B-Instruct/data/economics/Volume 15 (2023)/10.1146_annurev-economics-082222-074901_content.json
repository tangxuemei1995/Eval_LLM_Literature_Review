{"Abstract": "This study examines the relationship between non-bank financial intermediation, investment funds, and emerging market vulnerabilities in the context of global risk and international capital flows. Non-bank financial intermediation, particularly through investment funds, plays a crucial role in facilitating international capital flows to emerging markets. However, this increased exposure to global risk shocks can also amplify tail risk, leading to potential vulnerabilities in these economies. The study analyzes the impact of non-bank financial intermediation on emerging market vulnerabilities, with a focus on benchmark investing strategies. Using a panel data set of emerging markets, we find that increased non-bank financial intermediation is associated with higher levels of vulnerability to global risk shocks. Our results suggest that benchmark investing strategies can help mitigate tail risk, but the effectiveness of these strategies depends on the specific characteristics of the investment funds and the emerging markets they serve. The findings have implications for policymakers and investors seeking to manage emerging market risks in a globalized economy."}
