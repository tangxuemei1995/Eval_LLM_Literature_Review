{"Abstract": "This study examines the current state of antitrust reform from an economic perspective, with a focus on the impact of competition on market outcomes. The literature review reveals that traditional antitrust approaches have been criticized for their narrow focus on preventing monopolies, while neglecting the benefits of competition in driving innovation and efficiency. The analysis of recent mergers and acquisitions highlights the need for a more nuanced approach to antitrust regulation, one that balances the protection of competition with the promotion of economic growth. The study proposes a new framework for antitrust reform, incorporating elements of economic theory and empirical evidence to inform policy decisions. The findings suggest that a more flexible and adaptive approach to antitrust regulation is necessary to address the evolving nature of competition in the digital economy."}
