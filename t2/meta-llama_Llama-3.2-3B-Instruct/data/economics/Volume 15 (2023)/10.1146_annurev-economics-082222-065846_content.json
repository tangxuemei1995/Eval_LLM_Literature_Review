{"Abstract": "This study employs local projections to estimate vector autoregressions (VARs) on panel data, accounting for spatial heterogeneity and non-stationarity. By applying local projections, we can effectively capture the complex relationships between variables at different geographic locations. The proposed method is tested on a dataset of economic indicators from various regions, revealing significant spatial correlations and non-linear interactions. The results suggest that local projections can provide more accurate estimates of potential outcomes, such as economic growth and inflation, compared to traditional VAR approaches. The findings have implications for policy-making and forecasting in applied economics."}
