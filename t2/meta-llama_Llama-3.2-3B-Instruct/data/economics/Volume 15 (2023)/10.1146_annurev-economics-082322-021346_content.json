{"Abstract": "This study integrates Austrian economics with behavioral economics to examine the impact of governance and social economy on entrepreneurship and economic development in the face of infectious diseases and natural disasters. A robust political economy framework is employed to analyze the effects of war on economic systems, highlighting the importance of institutional resilience. The findings suggest that robust governance and social economy structures can mitigate the negative effects of crises, promoting entrepreneurship and economic growth. The study contributes to the development of a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between economic systems and social institutions."}
