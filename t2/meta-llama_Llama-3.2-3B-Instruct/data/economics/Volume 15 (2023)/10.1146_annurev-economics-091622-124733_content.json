{"Abstract": "This study investigates the cognitive limitations of contingent thinking, a fundamental concept in behavioral theory, through a series of experiments. The results demonstrate that individuals consistently exhibit the sure-thing principle, a cognitive bias that leads to suboptimal decision-making. Our findings have significant implications for cognitive economics and highlight the need for more nuanced understanding of human decision-making processes, particularly in situations involving uncertainty and risk."}
