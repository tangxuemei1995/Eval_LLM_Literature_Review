{"Abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between parenting and social mobility within and across generations, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying the transmission of social advantages and disadvantages. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature, we examine the role of parental skills and resources in shaping children's social outcomes, including educational attainment, employment prospects, and socioeconomic status. Our analysis reveals that parenting practices, such as parental involvement, education, and socio-economic status, have a significant impact on children's social mobility. Furthermore, we find that these effects are not limited to the individual child, but also influence the social mobility of subsequent generations. The findings suggest that effective parenting can mitigate the effects of inequality and promote social mobility, while poor parenting can exacerbate existing social disparities. The study's implications highlight the importance of addressing the intergenerational transmission of social disadvantage and the need for policies and interventions that support parents in developing the skills and resources necessary to promote social mobility. Ultimately, this research underscores the critical role of parenting in shaping social outcomes and promoting human development across generations."}
