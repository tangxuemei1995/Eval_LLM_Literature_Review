{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex relationships between tropical deforestation, environmental degradation, and biodiversity loss, with a focus on the economic drivers and consequences of these processes. Using remote sensing data and economic modeling, we analyze the impact of land use change on tropical ecosystems and the resulting externalities, including climate change and environmental degradation. Our results highlight the critical role of natural resource management in mitigating the effects of tropical deforestation and promoting sustainable land use practices. We also explore the political economy of tropical deforestation, including the role of common-property resources and the distribution of benefits and costs among stakeholders. By integrating insights from environmental economics and remote sensing, this study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the economics of tropical deforestation and informing policy interventions to address this pressing global issue."}
