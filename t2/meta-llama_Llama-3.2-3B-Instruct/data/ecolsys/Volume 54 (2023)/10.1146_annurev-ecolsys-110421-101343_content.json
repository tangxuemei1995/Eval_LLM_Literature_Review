{"Abstract": "This review synthesizes the intersection of conservation paleobiology and the Anthropocene, highlighting the significance of terrestrial communities in understanding the dynamics of ecosystems under environmental stress. By examining fossil records, we demonstrate the resilience and adaptability of ancient ecosystems in response to climate change, anthropogenic disturbances, and other environmental stressors. The analysis of fossilized species and ecosystems reveals a complex interplay between biodiversity, ecosystem function, and the impact of human activities on the environment. This study underscores the importance of considering the long-term history of terrestrial communities in informing conservation strategies for the Anthropocene era, and highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between human activities, environmental stressors, and ecosystem resilience."}
