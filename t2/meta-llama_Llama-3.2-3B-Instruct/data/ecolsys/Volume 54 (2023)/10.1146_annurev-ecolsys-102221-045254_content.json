{"Abstract": "Plant chemical defenses have evolved to protect plants from herbivores and pathogens, influencing community assembly and shaping ecosystem processes. This review synthesizes the current understanding of the evolutionary ecology of plant chemical defenses, from the molecular mechanisms underlying their production to their impact on plantâ€“herbivore interactions and community diversity. We examine the co-evolutionary dynamics between plants and herbivores, highlighting the role of plant secondary metabolites in modulating herbivore behavior and community composition. Our analysis reveals that the evolution of plant chemical defenses has driven the assembly of plant communities, influencing the structure and function of ecosystems. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of plant defense evolution for our understanding of biodiversity and ecosystem resilience, highlighting the need for a more integrated approach to studying the complex interactions between plants, herbivores, and their environment."}
