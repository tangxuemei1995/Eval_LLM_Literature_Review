{"Abstract": "Density-dependent selection is a fundamental process shaping the evolution of populations, influencing the structure and function of ecosystems. This phenomenon arises from the interactions between organisms and their environment, leading to the regulation of population growth and the maintenance of ecological balance. The age structure of populations plays a crucial role in density-dependent selection, as it affects the reproductive output and survival rates of individuals. This study examines the relationship between age structure and density-dependent selection, exploring its implications for r-selection and K-selection strategies. By analyzing the norms of reaction and population regulation, we demonstrate that density-dependent selection can lead to the evolution of age-structured populations, favoring K-selection traits that promote stability and longevity. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the dynamics of ecosystems and the evolution of life history traits, highlighting the importance of considering the interplay between age structure and density-dependent selection in ecological and evolutionary contexts."}
