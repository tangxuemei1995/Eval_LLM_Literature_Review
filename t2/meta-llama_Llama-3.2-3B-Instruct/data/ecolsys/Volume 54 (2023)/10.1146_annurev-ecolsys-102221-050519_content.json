{"Abstract": "The evolution of parental care in amphibians has been shaped by the unique demands of their life cycle, which involves aquatic larval development and terrestrial adult life. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the diverse strategies employed by amphibians to ensure the survival of their offspring, including fertilization modes, protection, transport, and nutrition. Terrestrial species have evolved complex parental care behaviors, such as brooding and guarding, to protect their eggs and tadpoles from predators and environmental stressors. In contrast, aquatic species often rely on parental sex roles, where males and females take on distinct reproductive and parental responsibilities. By examining the interplay between fertilization mode, terrestriality, and parental care, this review highlights the importance of considering the ecological context in which parental care evolves. Understanding these strategies can provide insights into the evolution of parental care in other vertebrates and inform conservation efforts for amphibian populations."}
