{"Abstract": "This study provides new insights into the evolution of a model system, the Anolis lizards, through an examination of their adaptive radiation in the Caribbean. By integrating phylogenetic, ecological, and anthropogenic factors, our research reveals a complex interplay between species interactions, habitat modification, and climate change. Our analysis of Anolis species diversity and distribution across the Caribbean reveals a pattern of rapid evolution and adaptive radiation in response to changing environmental conditions. We demonstrate that human activities, such as deforestation and invasive species introduction, have significantly impacted Anolis populations and ecosystems, leading to a shift towards more specialized and fragmented species assemblages. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of the impact of the Anthropocene on tropical ecosystems and highlight the need for conservation efforts to protect these unique and ecologically important species."}
