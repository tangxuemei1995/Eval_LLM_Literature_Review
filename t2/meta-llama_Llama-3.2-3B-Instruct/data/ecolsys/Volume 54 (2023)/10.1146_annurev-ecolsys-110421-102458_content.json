{"Abstract": "Terrestrial phosphorus cycling plays a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem health and productivity, particularly in response to climatic change. This study investigates the responses of phosphorus cycling in forest, grassland, and tundra ecosystems to projected climate change scenarios using a combination of field experiments and modeling approaches. Our results show that changes in temperature and precipitation patterns alter phosphorus availability and leaching rates in these ecosystems, leading to significant shifts in phosphorus cycling patterns. In forest ecosystems, increased phosphorus leaching is associated with warmer temperatures, while in grassland and tundra ecosystems, phosphorus limitation is exacerbated by drought conditions. Our findings highlight the importance of considering phosphorus cycling in climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, particularly in regions with limited phosphorus resources. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the responses of terrestrial phosphorus cycling to climatic change and inform the development of more effective management practices for these ecosystems."}
