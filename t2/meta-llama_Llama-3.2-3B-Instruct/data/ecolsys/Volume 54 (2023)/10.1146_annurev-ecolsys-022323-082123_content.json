{"Abstract": "Marine climate change ecology is increasingly recognizing the importance of variability in the face of warming temperatures. While heatwaves and rising sea temperatures pose significant threats to marine ecosystems, variability in temperature and other environmental factors can provide refuge for certain species. This variability can manifest as depth refuge, where species migrate to deeper waters to escape surface heat stress. Acclimation to changing conditions is also crucial, allowing species to adapt to new thermal regimes. However, legacy effects of past climate change can persist, influencing the responses of species to current and future climate change. This review synthesizes the current literature on the importance of variability in marine climate change ecology, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex interactions between climate change, species responses, and ecosystem resilience. By examining the interplay between variability and climate change, we can better predict the impacts of warming on marine ecosystems and inform effective conservation and management strategies."}
