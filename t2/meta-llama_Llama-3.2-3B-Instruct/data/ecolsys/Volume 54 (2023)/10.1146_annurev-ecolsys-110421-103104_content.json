{"Abstract": "South Florida is recognized as the world's most invaded continental ecoregion, with numerous non-native species (NNS) having been introduced, spreading, and exerting significant ecological impacts. This phenomenon is attributed to the empty niche hypothesis, which posits that NNS can establish and thrive in areas where native species are absent or scarce. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that biological control agents, such as natural predators and pathogens, have been employed to eradicate NNS, yet their efficacy is often limited. The establishment of NNS is facilitated by factors such as climate change, human activity, and the introduction of NNS through ballast water and other means. The ecological impacts of NNS in South Florida are far-reaching, including alterations to native species populations, disruption of ecosystem processes, and loss of biodiversity. Understanding the patterns and drivers of NNS introduction, spread, and ecological impact is crucial for developing effective management strategies to mitigate these effects."}
