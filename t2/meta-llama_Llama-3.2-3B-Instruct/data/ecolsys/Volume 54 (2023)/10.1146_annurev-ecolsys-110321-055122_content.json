{"Abstract": "Large Old World fruit bats, commonly referred to as flying foxes, are facing unprecedented threats to their survival, with many species on the brink of extinction. This study examines the causes and consequences of the decline of Pteropus species, with a focus on the impact of hunting and climate change. Our analysis reveals that habitat loss and fragmentation, driven by deforestation and land conversion, have led to a decline in fruit bat populations. Additionally, the increasing frequency and severity of hunting, often driven by local communities and wildlife trade, have further exacerbated the decline. Climate change is also having a profound impact, altering the availability of food resources and disrupting the delicate balance of ecosystems. The loss of these keystone species has significant consequences for ecosystem function and biodiversity, highlighting the need for urgent conservation action to protect these iconic animals and the ecosystems they inhabit."}
