{"Abstract": "Background acoustics, or the ambient soundscape, plays a crucial role in shaping the behavior and ecology of terrestrial organisms. Research has shown that sound can have both direct and indirect effects on animal behavior, influencing foraging, mating, and predator avoidance. In community ecology, background acoustics can also impact the distribution and abundance of species, with certain sounds masking or enhancing the presence of other species. This review synthesizes the current state of knowledge on the role of background acoustics in terrestrial ecology, highlighting the complex interactions between sound, behavior, and community structure. We discuss the mechanisms by which background acoustics influences animal behavior, including hearing and sound masking, and examine the empirical evidence for the indirect effects of background acoustics on community ecology. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of the complex relationships between sound, behavior, and ecology in terrestrial ecosystems."}
