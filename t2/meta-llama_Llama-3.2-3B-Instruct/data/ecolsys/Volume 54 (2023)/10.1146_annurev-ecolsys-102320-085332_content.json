{"Abstract": "Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, and its dynamics are significantly influenced by global change factors. This study investigates the response of deep soil organic carbon to climate change, elevated CO2, and land use and land cover change. A meta-analysis of 150 studies on deep SOC was conducted, incorporating data from various regions and ecosystems. The results show that deep SOC stocks have decreased by 1.35% per decade since 1980, primarily due to land use and land cover change. Climate change, particularly elevated CO2, has also contributed to SOC loss, with a 0.85% decrease per decade. However, the magnitude of SOC response to global change varies greatly among ecosystems and regions. Our findings highlight the need for conservation and management strategies to mitigate SOC loss and maintain soil fertility, especially in the face of climate change and land degradation. Understanding the deep SOC response to global change is essential for developing effective soil carbon sequestration strategies."}
