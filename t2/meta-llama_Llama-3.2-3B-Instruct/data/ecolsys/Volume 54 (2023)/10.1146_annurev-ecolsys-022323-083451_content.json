{"Abstract": "Pleiotropy, the phenomenon where a single genetic variant influences multiple phenotypic traits, has been a long-standing topic of interest in evolutionary biology. This review examines the patterns and evolutionary consequences of pleiotropy, with a focus on its role in adaptation, disease, and the cost of complexity. We discuss the various types of pleiotropy, including antagonistic pleiotropy, where a variant's beneficial effect on one trait is detrimental to another, and the costs associated with pleiotropy, such as increased disease susceptibility. Our analysis reveals that pleiotropy can lead to the evolution of complex traits, but also increases the risk of deleterious effects. We also explore the role of mutation in shaping pleiotropic relationships and the potential consequences for adaptation and disease. By integrating insights from evolutionary genetics, population biology, and disease ecology, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between pleiotropy, adaptation, and disease."}
