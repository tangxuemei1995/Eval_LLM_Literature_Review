{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex relationships between seed dispersal processes, syndromes, and effectiveness within the context of a generalized gravity framework. Drawing on movement ecology principles, we investigate how various environmental and biological factors influence seed dispersal outcomes. Our analysis reveals that dispersal syndromes, characterized by specific combinations of traits, significantly impact seed dispersal effectiveness. We demonstrate that the seedscape, shaped by factors such as topography and vegetation structure, also plays a crucial role in modulating dispersal patterns. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the intricate dynamics governing seed dispersal, highlighting the importance of considering both dispersal processes and environmental context in predicting seed dispersal outcomes."}
