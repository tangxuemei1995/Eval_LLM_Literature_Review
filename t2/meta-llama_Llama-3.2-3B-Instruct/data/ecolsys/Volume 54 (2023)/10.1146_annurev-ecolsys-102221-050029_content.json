{"Abstract": "Sky islands, isolated landmasses with unique geological histories, serve as a global tool for predicting the ecological and evolutionary consequences of climate change. By examining the genetic variation and relict populations found in these isolated ecosystems, researchers can gain insights into the potential impacts of climate-driven changes on biodiversity. The convergent evolution of species in sky islands, where similar environmental pressures have shaped distinct adaptations, provides a natural laboratory for studying the evolutionary responses to climate change. This research highlights the importance of sky islands as a model system for understanding the complex interactions between climate, evolution, and ecology. By leveraging the unique characteristics of sky islands, scientists can develop more accurate predictions of the ecological and evolutionary consequences of climate change, ultimately informing conservation efforts and management strategies to mitigate its impacts."}
