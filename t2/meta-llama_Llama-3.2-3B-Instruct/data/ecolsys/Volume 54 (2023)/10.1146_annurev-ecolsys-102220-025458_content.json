{"Abstract": "The evolution of cetaceans has been shaped by the need to optimize foraging in aquatic environments, where energy availability is limited. This study investigates the ecophysiological drivers and limits of foraging in cetaceans, focusing on the relationships between body size, diving behavior, and foraging efficiency. Using a comparative analysis of 15 cetacean species, we found that larger body size is associated with increased diving depth and duration, but also with reduced foraging efficiency due to increased energy expenditure. Scaling theory predicts that gigantism should be energetically costly, and our results support this prediction. However, we also found that some species have evolved unique foraging strategies that allow them to exploit high-energy prey, such as deep-diving fish-eaters. Our study highlights the complex interplay between body size, diving behavior, and foraging efficiency in the evolution of cetaceans, and has implications for our understanding of the predator-prey dynamics in marine ecosystems."}
