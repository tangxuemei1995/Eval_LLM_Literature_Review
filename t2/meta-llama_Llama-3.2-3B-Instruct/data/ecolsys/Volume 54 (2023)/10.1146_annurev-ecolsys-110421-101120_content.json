{"Abstract": "This study investigates novel disturbance regimes and their ecological responses, highlighting the importance of understanding thresholds and response traits in shaping ecosystem resilience and recovery. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that traditional disturbance regimes, such as fires and floods, are being replaced by novel disturbances, including climate change, invasive species, and human activities. These novel disturbances can have disproportionate impacts on ecosystem processes and structure, leading to altered succession patterns and response traits. The study identifies key thresholds that determine the likelihood of successful recovery and highlights the need for adaptive management strategies to mitigate the effects of novel disturbances. By examining the intersection of disturbance regimes, response traits, and thresholds, this research provides a framework for understanding the complex relationships between ecosystem disturbance and recovery, ultimately informing effective conservation and management practices."}
