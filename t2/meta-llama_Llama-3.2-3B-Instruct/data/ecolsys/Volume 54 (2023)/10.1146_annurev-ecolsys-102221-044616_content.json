{"Abstract": "Urban pollination ecology examines the complex relationships between urban ecosystems and pollinators, highlighting the intricate dynamics of mutualism and dispersal within city environments. This research reveals that urban pollinators, such as bees and butterflies, play a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem services, including plant reproduction and food security. However, urbanization poses significant threats to pollinator populations, including habitat loss, fragmentation, and pesticide use. By analyzing network structures and connectivity patterns, this study demonstrates that urban pollination ecology is characterized by a complex web of relationships between pollinators, plants, and other urban organisms. The findings suggest that urban planning and policy interventions can be designed to promote pollinator-friendly habitats, enhance connectivity, and foster mutualistic relationships, ultimately contributing to the conservation of urban pollinators and ecosystem services."}
