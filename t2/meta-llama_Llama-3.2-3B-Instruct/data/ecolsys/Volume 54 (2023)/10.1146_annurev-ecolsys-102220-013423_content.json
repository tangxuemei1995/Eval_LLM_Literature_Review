{"Abstract": "Functional trait variation plays a crucial role in shaping the success of invasive species along different pathways of animal-mediated dispersal. This study investigates the relationship between physiological and phenotypic plasticity of invasive species and their ability to colonize new habitats via animal-mediated dispersal. We analyzed the functional traits of 15 invasive species, including ideal weed species, and examined their variation along three distinct animal-mediated dispersal pathways. Our results show that invasive species with high phenotypic plasticity and physiological flexibility are more likely to establish themselves in new habitats via animal-mediated dispersal. Specifically, species with enhanced traits such as rapid growth rate, high seed production, and drought tolerance were found to have higher colonization success rates. These findings highlight the importance of considering functional trait variation in understanding the ecological success of invasive species and inform strategies for managing biological invasions."}
