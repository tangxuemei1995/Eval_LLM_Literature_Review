{"Abstract": "This review explores the emerging field of non-Hermitian topological phenomena, focusing on the interplay between non-Hermiticity and topological phases. We discuss the breakdown of the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence and the emergence of new topological invariants and edge states. The review covers recent advances in spectral theory, highlighting the role of exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin effects. Applications in photonic and electronic systems are examined, illustrating the potential for novel devices and materials. Theoretical frameworks and experimental realizations are discussed, providing a comprehensive overview of this rapidly evolving area of research."}
