{"Abstract": "This study presents a data-driven approach to the discovery of robust materials for photocatalytic energy conversion, focusing on their aqueous stability and efficiency. By integrating machine learning algorithms with high-throughput computational screening, we identified a series of metal oxides and sulfides with exceptional photocatalytic performance and durability in aqueous environments. The predictive models were trained on a comprehensive dataset of material properties, including bandgap energy, redox potentials, and surface chemistry. Experimental validation confirmed the enhanced stability and activity of the selected materials under simulated solar irradiation, demonstrating their potential for scalable renewable energy applications. This work highlights the synergy between data science and materials science in accelerating the development of sustainable photocatalysts for energy conversion."}
