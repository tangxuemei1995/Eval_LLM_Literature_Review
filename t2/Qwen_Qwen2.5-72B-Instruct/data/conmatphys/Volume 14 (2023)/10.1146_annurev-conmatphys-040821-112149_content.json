{"Abstract": "This study investigates the locomotion of microorganisms in complex fluids, focusing on the interplay between active matter and the rheological properties of biological fluids. Using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we explore how the viscoelasticity of soft matter affects the swimming efficiency and dynamics of active suspensions. Our findings reveal that the presence of polymers and other macromolecules in the fluid can significantly alter the swimming behavior, leading to enhanced or reduced motility depending on the fluid's microstructure. These results have implications for understanding the movement of microorganisms in natural environments and the design of artificial microswimmers for biomedical applications."}
