{"Abstract": "This study explores the phenomena of odd viscosity and odd elasticity in active matter systems, which exhibit non-equilibrium behavior. By integrating principles from continuum and fluid mechanics, we analyze how these unconventional properties arise in systems far from equilibrium. Our findings reveal that odd viscosity, a non-dissipative form of viscosity, and odd elasticity, a chiral elastic response, play crucial roles in the hydrodynamics and rheology of active materials. These properties are shown to influence the stability and dynamics of active fluids, offering new insights into the behavior of complex systems such as bacterial suspensions and active gels."}
