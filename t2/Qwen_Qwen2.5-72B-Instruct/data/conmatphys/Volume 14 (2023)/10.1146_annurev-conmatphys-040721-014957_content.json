{"Abstract": "The Spin Seebeck Effect (SSE) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating the fundamental properties of magnetic materials, including elementary excitations, spin correlations, transport, magnetic order, and domain dynamics. This review highlights recent advancements in SSE studies, particularly in the context of spin(calori)tronics and antiferromagnetic spintronics. The inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) plays a crucial role in detecting the SSE, enabling the measurement of spin currents generated by thermal gradients. Magnons, as the primary carriers of spin angular momentum, are central to understanding the SSE in various magnetic systems, including quantum spin liquids. Additionally, the influence of nuclear spins on the SSE is explored, revealing new insights into the interplay between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. These findings not only advance our understanding of spin dynamics in solids but also pave the way for novel spintronic applications."}
