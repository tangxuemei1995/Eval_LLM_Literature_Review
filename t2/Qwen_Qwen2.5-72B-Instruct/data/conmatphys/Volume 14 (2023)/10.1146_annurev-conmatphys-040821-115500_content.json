{"Abstract": "This study explores the modeling of active colloids, focusing on the transition from active Brownian particles to the inclusion of hydrodynamic and chemical fields. Through advanced numerical modeling, we investigate the behavior of microswimmers in complex environments, considering both hydrodynamic and phoretic interactions. The research highlights the importance of these interactions in shaping the collective dynamics and self-organization of active colloids. We also examine the role of active baths and active engines in enhancing the efficiency and functionality of microswimmers, providing insights into the design of novel microscale devices and systems."}
