{"Abstract": "Quantum many-body scars, a phenomenon where certain quantum systems fail to thermalize despite being isolated and interacting, are explored from a quasiparticle perspective. This study investigates how constrained dynamics and the presence of quasiparticles can lead to the emergence of scarred eigenstates, which defy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. By analyzing out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics, we identify conditions under which these scars manifest, providing insights into the interplay between quantum chaos and integrability. Our findings suggest that the existence of quasiparticles with specific symmetries and conservation laws can stabilize non-thermal states, offering a new avenue for understanding the breakdown of thermalization in quantum systems."}
