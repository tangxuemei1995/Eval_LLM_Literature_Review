{"Abstract": "This review dissects the methodologies and challenges associated with measuring energetic costs in cell biology through the lens of flux balances. By integrating bioenergetics and metabolic flux analysis, we explore how cells allocate energy resources to maintain homeostasis and support growth. Techniques such as 13C metabolic flux analysis, extracellular flux analysis, and isotopic labeling are discussed, highlighting their strengths and limitations. The review also addresses the complexities of in vivo measurements and the need for robust computational models to interpret flux data accurately. Understanding these energetic costs is crucial for elucidating cellular processes and has implications for metabolic engineering and disease treatment."}
