{"Abstract": "This study explores the physics of human crowds, integrating principles from active matter and social physics to analyze emergent phenomena in pedestrian flows. Through observational experiments, we investigate the collective behavior of individuals, revealing patterns and dynamics that emerge from local interactions. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of crowd dynamics and have implications for urban planning and safety."}
