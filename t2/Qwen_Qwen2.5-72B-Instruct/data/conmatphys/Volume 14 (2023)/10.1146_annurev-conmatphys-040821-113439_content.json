{"Abstract": "This study explores the concept of learning without neurons, focusing on physical systems capable of adaptive behavior through non-biological mechanisms. By integrating principles from learning theory, inverse design, and machine learning, we investigate how metamaterials, self-assembly processes, and molecular computing can be engineered to perform tasks typically associated with neural networks. Our research demonstrates that these physical systems can autonomously optimize their structures and functions in response to environmental stimuli, enabling applications in adaptive materials, smart sensors, and autonomous molecular machines. The findings contribute to a broader understanding of learning in non-neural contexts and open new avenues for the development of intelligent physical systems."}
