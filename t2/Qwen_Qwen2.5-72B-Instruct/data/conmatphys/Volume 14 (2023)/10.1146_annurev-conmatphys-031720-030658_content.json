{"Abstract": "Random quantum circuits (RQCs) have emerged as a powerful tool for exploring the fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics, particularly in the context of entanglement, nonequilibrium dynamics, and quantum chaos. By simulating the evolution of quantum systems through sequences of random unitary gates, RQCs provide a framework to study the propagation of entanglement and the emergence of complex quantum states. Recent studies have shown that RQCs can exhibit universal behavior in the scaling of entanglement entropy, which is crucial for understanding the thermalization and scrambling of quantum information. Additionally, RQCs serve as a testbed for quantum simulators, enabling the investigation of phenomena such as many-body localization and the effects of quantum measurements on dynamical processes. The chaotic nature of RQCs also makes them a valuable resource for benchmarking quantum hardware and developing error mitigation techniques, paving the way for practical applications in quantum computing and information processing."}
