{"Abstract": "Tensor network algorithms have emerged as powerful tools in computational physics, particularly for simulating quantum many-body systems. This review provides a comprehensive route map for understanding and implementing tensor network methods, emphasizing their applications in quantum information and numerical simulations. We discuss the fundamental concepts of tensor networks, including matrix product states (MPS) and projected entangled pair states (PEPS), and their role in capturing entanglement in quantum systems. The review also highlights recent advances in algorithmic techniques, such as variational optimization and renormalization group methods, which enhance the efficiency and accuracy of simulations. Key challenges and future directions in the field are outlined, making this a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in computational physics and quantum information science."}
