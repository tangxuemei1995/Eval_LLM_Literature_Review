{"Abstract": "The spatial and temporal organization of chromatin is crucial for gene regulation and genome stability. At small scales, nucleosomes package DNA, influencing accessibility and transcription. At larger scales, chromatin loops and domains are formed through mechanisms such as loop extrusion, which are essential for coordinating gene expression. Epigenetic modifications play a key role in modulating these structures, affecting chromatin dynamics and cellular function. Recent advances in imaging and genomics have provided insights into the intricate interplay between chromatin structure and function, highlighting the importance of both local and global chromatin organization in cellular processes."}
