{"Abstract": "The study of topological metals has emerged as a vibrant field, bridging the realms of condensed matter physics and topology. This work delves into the fermiology of these materials, focusing on the intricate interplay between the Fermi surface, Berry phase, and quantum oscillations. Topological metals, characterized by their non-trivial band structures, exhibit unique electronic properties that are deeply rooted in the geometric and topological aspects of their Fermi surfaces. We explore how the Berry phase, a geometric phase acquired by electrons as they traverse the Brillouin zone, influences the electronic transport and magnetic properties of these materials. Quantum oscillations, a hallmark of Fermi surface topology, are analyzed in detail, providing insights into the complex Fermi surface geometry. Additionally, the phenomenon of magnetic breakdown, where electrons tunnel between different parts of the Fermi surface, is examined, revealing its role in shaping the electronic band structure. The discussion is further enriched by the examination of Diracâ€“Weyl semimetals, a subclass of topological metals where the Fermi surface hosts linearly dispersing bands, leading to exotic quasiparticles. This comprehensive analysis underscores the significance of topological considerations in understanding the electronic behavior of these materials, paving the way for potential applications in quantum computing and spintronics."}
