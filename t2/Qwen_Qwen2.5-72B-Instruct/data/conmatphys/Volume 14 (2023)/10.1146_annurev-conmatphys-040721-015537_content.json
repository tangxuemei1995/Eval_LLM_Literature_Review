{"Abstract": "This study explores the dynamics of Floquet states in open quantum systems, focusing on the interplay between periodic driving and dissipation. By employing nonequilibrium statistical physics, we analyze the stability and coherence of Floquet states under various environmental conditions. Our findings reveal that the presence of a dissipative environment can lead to the emergence of novel quasi-steady states, characterized by unique spectral properties and enhanced resilience to decoherence. These results provide valuable insights into the control and manipulation of quantum systems in periodically driven settings, with potential applications in quantum computing and quantum simulation."}
