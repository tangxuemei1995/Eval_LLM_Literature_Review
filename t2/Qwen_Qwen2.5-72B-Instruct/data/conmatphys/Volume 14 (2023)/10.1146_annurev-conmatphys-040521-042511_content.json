{"Abstract": "This study explores the interplay between superconductivity and local inversion-symmetry breaking, focusing on the emergence of topological and unconventional superconducting states. By incorporating Rashba spin-orbit coupling into a model system, we demonstrate that local inversion-symmetry breaking can induce hidden spin polarization, leading to novel superconducting phases. Our findings reveal that the combination of these effects can stabilize topological superconductivity, characterized by the presence of Majorana zero modes at the boundaries. These results provide insights into the design of materials for quantum computing applications and highlight the importance of symmetry breaking in the realization of exotic superconducting states."}
