{"Abstract": "This study explores the potential and perspectives of land modifications as a strategy for mitigating concurrent flood and drought risks, emphasizing the motivations and practices of land users. Through a comprehensive review of case studies and empirical data, the research highlights how land modifications, such as contour plowing, terracing, and the creation of water retention basins, can enhance water management and soil stability. The findings indicate that while these practices offer significant benefits in reducing the impacts of extreme weather events, their adoption is influenced by socio-economic factors, including land tenure, access to resources, and community support. The study also underscores the importance of integrating local knowledge and participatory approaches in the design and implementation of land modification strategies to ensure their effectiveness and sustainability. Overall, the research provides valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners aiming to develop climate-resilient land management practices."}
