{"Abstract": "This paper explores the development and application of metrics for decision-making in the realm of energy justice, focusing on the dimensions of distributive, procedural, and recognition justice. We review existing frameworks and propose a comprehensive set of indicators to assess energy equity, including access to affordable and reliable energy, participation in decision-making processes, and the recognition of diverse energy needs and cultural values. These metrics are designed to guide policymakers, practitioners, and researchers in creating more just and equitable energy systems. Through case studies and empirical analysis, we demonstrate the utility of these metrics in identifying disparities and informing targeted interventions to promote energy justice."}
