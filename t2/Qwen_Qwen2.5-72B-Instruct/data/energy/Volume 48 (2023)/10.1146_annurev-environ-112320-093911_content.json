{"Abstract": "This review synthesizes the current evidence on sustainable intensification (SI) strategies aimed at enhancing food production in smallholder agricultural systems across the Global South. Focusing on staple crops, the study evaluates the impact of improved cultivars, push-pull systems, and the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) on yield, resource efficiency, and environmental sustainability. A comprehensive analysis of 50 peer-reviewed articles reveals that SI practices, particularly the adoption of improved cultivars and SRI, consistently lead to significant increases in crop yields while reducing water and fertilizer inputs. Push-pull systems, which integrate pest management with soil health, show promise in enhancing biodiversity and reducing chemical pesticide use. However, the success of these strategies is context-dependent, influenced by factors such as soil quality, climate, and farmer knowledge. The review highlights the need for tailored, participatory approaches to ensure the widespread adoption and long-term sustainability of SI practices in diverse smallholder settings."}
