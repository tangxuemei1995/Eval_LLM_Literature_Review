{"Abstract": "This paper provides a comprehensive review of climate mitigation policies over the past three decades, examining the effectiveness of various policy instruments in achieving significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Through a detailed analysis of the literature, we assess the impact of regulatory measures, economic incentives, and voluntary actions on global and regional scales. The review highlights the evolution of climate policy from early, fragmented efforts to more coordinated international frameworks, such as the Paris Agreement. Key findings indicate that while some policies have led to notable abatement, overall progress remains insufficient to meet the ambitious targets set by the international community. The analysis also reveals that the success of climate policies is highly context-dependent, influenced by factors such as political will, economic conditions, and technological advancements. Furthermore, the paper identifies gaps in current policy approaches, including inadequate enforcement mechanisms, limited stakeholder engagement, and insufficient integration of adaptation strategies. Recommendations for enhancing policy effectiveness include the adoption of more stringent emission reduction targets, the development of robust monitoring and verification systems, and the promotion of cross-sectoral collaboration. This review underscores the urgent need for more ambitious and coordinated global efforts to address the escalating climate crisis."}
