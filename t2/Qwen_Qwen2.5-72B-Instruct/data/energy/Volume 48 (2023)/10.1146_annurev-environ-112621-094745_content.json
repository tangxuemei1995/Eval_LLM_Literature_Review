{"Abstract": "This study provides a comprehensive overview of the genesis of brine and its sustainable resource recovery from salt lakes worldwide. Brine, a highly concentrated solution of salts, is a critical resource for the extraction of valuable minerals such as potash and lithium. The formation of brine is influenced by geological, climatic, and hydrological factors, leading to diverse compositions and concentrations. Advanced processing techniques, including solar evaporation, ion exchange, and membrane filtration, have been developed to enhance the recovery efficiency and reduce environmental impacts. The comprehensive utilization of brine not only supports the production of essential minerals but also contributes to the development of a circular economy by minimizing waste and maximizing resource efficiency. Case studies from major salt lake regions, such as the Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia and the Qaidam Basin in China, illustrate the potential and challenges of sustainable brine resource management. This research underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in optimizing brine utilization and ensuring long-term environmental sustainability."}
