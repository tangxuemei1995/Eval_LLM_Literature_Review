{"Abstract": "Plastics, ubiquitous in modern society, have become a significant environmental concern due to their persistence and the widespread contamination they cause. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the environmental impacts of plastics, focusing on microplastics and the chemical pollutants associated with them. Microplastics, defined as plastic particles less than 5 mm in diameter, are found in various environmental compartments, including oceans, soil, and air. These particles originate from the degradation of larger plastic items and the direct release of microbeads from personal care products. The presence of microplastics in the environment poses a threat to wildlife, as they can be ingested by organisms, leading to physical harm and the transfer of toxic chemicals. Polymers, the building blocks of plastics, often contain additives such as plasticizers, flame retardants, and stabilizers, which can leach into the environment, further exacerbating contamination. The chemical pollutants associated with plastics, including bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, have been linked to endocrine disruption and other adverse health effects in both wildlife and humans. This review highlights the need for comprehensive strategies to reduce plastic waste, improve recycling processes, and develop biodegradable alternatives to mitigate the environmental impact of plastics."}
