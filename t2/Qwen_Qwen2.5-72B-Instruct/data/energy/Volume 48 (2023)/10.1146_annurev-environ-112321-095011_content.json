{"Abstract": "This study delves into the cognitive and imaginative processes involved in envisioning alternative futures within the Anthropocene, a geological epoch marked by significant human impact on the Earth's ecosystems. By integrating insights from scenario planning, cognitive science, and environmental studies, we explore how different future visions can catalyze transformative change. The research employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative analysis of future scenarios with quantitative surveys to assess public anticipation and cognitive responses. Key findings highlight the importance of diverse and inclusive imagination in shaping resilient and sustainable futures. The study underscores the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to foster a deeper understanding of how future visions can inform and inspire action towards a more equitable and sustainable world."}
