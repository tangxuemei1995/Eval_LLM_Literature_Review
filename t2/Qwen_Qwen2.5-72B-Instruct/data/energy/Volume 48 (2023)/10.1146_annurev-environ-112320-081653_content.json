{"Abstract": "Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (HCBs) pose significant threats to freshwater ecosystems and human health, exacerbated by climate change and eutrophication. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the biological traits and mechanisms that enable cyanobacteria to form blooms, the production and impacts of cyanotoxins, and the risks associated with HCBs. We also discuss various control strategies, including physical, chemical, and biological methods, to mitigate the occurrence and effects of HCBs. Understanding these aspects is crucial for developing effective management practices and policies to protect water quality and public health in the face of environmental challenges."}
