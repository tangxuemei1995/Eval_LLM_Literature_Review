{"Abstract": "This study investigates the attribution of extreme weather events to climate change, focusing on the methodologies and challenges in quantifying the influence of anthropogenic activities on the frequency and intensity of such events. By synthesizing data from multiple climate models and observational records, the research highlights the increasing vulnerability of regions to extreme events, such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, and droughts. The analysis employs statistical techniques to isolate the signal of climate change from natural variability, providing robust evidence that human-induced warming has significantly altered the probability and magnitude of these events. The findings underscore the critical need for enhanced climate resilience and adaptation strategies, particularly in vulnerable regions. The study also discusses the limitations of current attribution methods and suggests avenues for future research to improve the accuracy and reliability of climate change attribution studies."}
