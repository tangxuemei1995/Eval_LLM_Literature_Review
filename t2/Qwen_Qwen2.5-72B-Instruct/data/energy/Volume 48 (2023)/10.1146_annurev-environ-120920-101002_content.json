{"Abstract": "This study explores the multifaceted implications of green technologies for environmental justice, focusing on the concepts of just transition, electrification, modal shift, sustainable buildings, and distributional justice. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature, the research highlights how the adoption of green technologies can both mitigate and exacerbate environmental inequalities. The analysis reveals that while electrification and sustainable building practices offer significant environmental benefits, their implementation often disproportionately benefits affluent communities, leaving marginalized groups behind. The study also underscores the importance of a just transition in the energy and transportation sectors, emphasizing the need for policies that ensure equitable access to green technologies and the creation of green jobs. Recommendations include targeted interventions to address distributional justice, such as subsidies for low-income households and community-led initiatives to promote sustainable practices. This research contributes to the broader discourse on achieving a sustainable and equitable future."}
