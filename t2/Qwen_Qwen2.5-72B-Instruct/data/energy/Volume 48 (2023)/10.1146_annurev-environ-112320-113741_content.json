{"Abstract": "This review synthesizes current knowledge on the state of the world's arable land, emphasizing the interplay between land degradation, biodiversity loss, and greenhouse gas emissions. Land degradation, driven by intensive agricultural practices, deforestation, and urbanization, has led to significant declines in soil carbon and fertility, impacting rural economies and food security. The conversion of natural habitats to agricultural land has also resulted in biodiversity loss, further compromising ecosystem resilience. However, sustainable land management practices, such as conservation agriculture and agroforestry, offer promising solutions to mitigate these challenges. These practices not only enhance soil carbon sequestration and biodiversity but also contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The integration of these strategies into national and international policies is crucial for the sustainable management of arable land and the support of rural livelihoods."}
