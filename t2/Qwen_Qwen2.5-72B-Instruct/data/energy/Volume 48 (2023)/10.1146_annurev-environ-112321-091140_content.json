{"Abstract": "This study assesses the global technical, economic, and feasible potential of renewable electricity from solar photovoltaics (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP), wind, hydropower, geothermal, and ocean energy. The technical potential, defined as the maximum achievable energy generation based on resource availability and technological constraints, is estimated using high-resolution spatial data and advanced modeling techniques. Results indicate that the global technical potential for renewable electricity is vast, with solar PV and wind energy leading the way due to their widespread resource availability and rapidly declining costs. The economic potential, which considers the cost-effectiveness of renewable technologies relative to conventional energy sources, is analyzed through a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis, incorporating factors such as capital and operational costs, subsidies, and carbon pricing. The findings suggest that a significant portion of the technical potential is economically viable, particularly in regions with high insolation and wind speeds, and where fossil fuel subsidies are being phased out. The feasible potential, which accounts for additional constraints such as environmental, social, and grid integration challenges, is evaluated through a multi-criteria decision analysis. This analysis reveals that while the technical and economic potentials are substantial, the feasible potential is more limited due to factors like land use conflicts, grid stability issues, and regulatory barriers. However, strategic policy interventions and technological advancements can significantly enhance the feasible potential, paving the way for a sustainable and resilient global energy system. The study underscores the critical role of renewable energy in achieving global climate targets and energy security, while highlighting the need for integrated planning and international cooperation to overcome existing barriers."}
