{"Abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between groundwater quality and public health, focusing on both geogenic and emerging contaminants. Groundwater, a critical resource for drinking water, is increasingly threatened by natural and anthropogenic pollutants. Key substances such as arsenic, fluoride, and nitrate, which are often geogenic, pose significant health risks, including cancer and skeletal fluorosis. Emerging contaminants, including pharmaceuticals and microplastics, further complicate the issue, with potential long-term health effects that are not yet fully understood. The research employs a comprehensive approach, integrating hydrogeological modeling, chemical analysis, and epidemiological studies to assess the impact of these contaminants on human health. The findings highlight the need for sustainable groundwater management practices, including regular monitoring, advanced treatment technologies, and public awareness campaigns. This study underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to ensure the protection of groundwater resources and the health of communities reliant on them."}
