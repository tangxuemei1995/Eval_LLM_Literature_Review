{"Abstract": "This study aims to advance our understanding of global fungal diversity, distribution, and conservation by integrating metabarcoding techniques with traditional taxonomic approaches. We focus on key fungal groups, including Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and early diverging fungi, to provide a comprehensive overview of their diversity and endemicity. Using metabarcoding, we identified over 10,000 fungal taxa from various ecosystems, revealing novel species and undersampled regions. The fungus:plant ratio was found to be significantly higher in tropical and temperate forests, highlighting the importance of these biomes for fungal conservation. Our assessment of the IUCN Red List status for identified taxa indicates that a substantial proportion of fungi are threatened, with many species lacking adequate conservation measures. We propose a dual approach of in situ and ex situ conservation strategies to protect fungal biodiversity, emphasizing the need for integrated policies and collaborative efforts across international boundaries. This research underscores the critical role of fungi in ecosystem functioning and the urgent need for their conservation."}
