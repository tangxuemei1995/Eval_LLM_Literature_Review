{"Abstract": "This paper reviews the current state of research on modeling low energy demand futures for residential and commercial buildings, focusing on climate change mitigation strategies. It examines the development of scenarios that integrate energy demand transformation with broader megatrends, such as urbanization, technological innovation, and socio-economic shifts. The review highlights the importance of aligning these scenarios with decent living standards to ensure equitable outcomes. Key research needs include improving the integration of behavioral and technological factors, enhancing the spatial and temporal resolution of models, and developing more robust methods for assessing the co-benefits and trade-offs of low energy demand pathways. The paper also underscores the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration to address the complex challenges of achieving sustainable and equitable energy futures in the building sector."}
