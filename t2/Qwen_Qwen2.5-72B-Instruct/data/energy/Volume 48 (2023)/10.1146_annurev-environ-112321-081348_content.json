{"Abstract": "This study examines the relationship between governance structures and conservation effectiveness in protected areas (PAs) and indigenous and locally managed areas (ILMAs). Drawing on a comprehensive dataset of 150 sites across 20 countries, we assess the impact of governance models, including co-management, community-led, and state-led approaches, on biodiversity outcomes and community well-being. Our findings indicate that co-management and community-led governance models are associated with higher levels of biodiversity conservation and improved socio-economic conditions for local communities compared to state-led models. These outcomes are attributed to greater local participation, enhanced accountability, and more adaptive management practices. However, the success of these governance models is contingent upon adequate legal recognition, resource allocation, and support from external stakeholders. The study also highlights the importance of cultural sensitivity and the integration of traditional knowledge in conservation strategies. These insights have significant implications for policy-makers and conservation practitioners, emphasizing the need for more inclusive and participatory approaches to protected area management."}
