{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate dynamics of fire regimes and their implications for biodiversity, climate change, and social-ecological systems in the Anthropocene. By integrating data from global fire records, climate models, and socio-economic indicators, we elucidate the feedback mechanisms between human activities and natural fire processes. Our findings highlight the critical role of fire in shaping Earth System dynamics and the urgent need for adaptive management strategies to enhance sustainability. We propose a framework for integrating fire science into broader conservation and land-use planning, emphasizing the importance of community engagement and policy reform. This research underscores the necessity of a holistic approach to fire management, balancing ecological integrity with human well-being in an increasingly fire-prone world."}
