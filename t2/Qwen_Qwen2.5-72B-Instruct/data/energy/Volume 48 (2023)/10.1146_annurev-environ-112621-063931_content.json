{"Abstract": "This study explores the interlinkages between decarbonization efforts in urban areas and their co-benefits for health, climate resilience, and equity. By analyzing the urban metabolism and its alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the research identifies key strategies for achieving zero-carbon transitions that enhance well-being and social equity. The findings highlight the importance of integrated policy approaches that address energy, transportation, and urban planning to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while improving air quality, public health, and social inclusivity. Case studies from cities with advanced decarbonization initiatives demonstrate the potential for these co-benefits, offering insights for policymakers and urban planners. The study concludes that a holistic approach to urban sustainability can significantly advance the SDGs, particularly in areas related to health, climate action, and reduced inequalities."}
