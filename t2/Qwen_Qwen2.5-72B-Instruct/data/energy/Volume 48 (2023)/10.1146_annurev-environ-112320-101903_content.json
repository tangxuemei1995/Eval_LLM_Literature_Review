{"Abstract": "This study examines the escalating risks posed by climate change to critical infrastructure in coastal regions, emphasizing the need for enhanced resilience strategies. Utilizing a comprehensive review of recent literature and case studies from vulnerable coastal areas, the research identifies key vulnerabilities and cascading hazards that can amplify the impact of climate-related events such as sea-level rise, storm surges, and extreme weather. The findings highlight the interdependencies between different infrastructure systems, such as energy, transportation, and water supply, and how failures in one sector can lead to widespread disruptions. The study also assesses the effectiveness of current adaptation measures and proposes a framework for integrating climate resilience into infrastructure planning and management. This framework includes recommendations for policy makers, engineers, and urban planners to mitigate the cascading effects of climate hazards and ensure the long-term sustainability of coastal critical infrastructure."}
