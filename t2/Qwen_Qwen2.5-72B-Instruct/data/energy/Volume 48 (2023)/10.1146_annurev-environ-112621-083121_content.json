{"Abstract": "Soils play a critical role in the global carbon cycle, acting as both a significant store and sink for carbon. This review synthesizes current understanding of soil carbon dynamics, emphasizing the processes of decomposition, root turnover, and litter accumulation. Utilizing models such as the Century and Millennial models, we explore the expectations and patterns of soil carbon storage under varying climate scenarios. The review highlights the importance of soil health and management practices in enhancing carbon sequestration, which is crucial for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Soil mapping and policy interventions are discussed as essential tools for identifying and implementing effective strategies to maintain and increase soil carbon stocks. The prospects for transitions towards more sustainable land use practices are evaluated, underscoring the need for integrated approaches that consider both ecological and socio-economic factors."}
