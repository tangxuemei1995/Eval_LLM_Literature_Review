{"Abstract": "This study critically examines the feasibility of achieving deforestation-free commodity supply chains, focusing on the interplay between land use, forest governance, and sustainability policies. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, we assess the effectiveness of current zero deforestation commitments and policy mixes. Our findings suggest that while significant progress has been made, challenges such as inconsistent enforcement, lack of transparency, and complex supply chain dynamics hinder the realization of deforestation-free goals. We propose a multi-stakeholder approach that integrates robust monitoring systems, enhanced governance frameworks, and collaborative policy efforts to address these challenges. This research underscores the need for a holistic and adaptive strategy to achieve sustainable land use and forest conservation."}
