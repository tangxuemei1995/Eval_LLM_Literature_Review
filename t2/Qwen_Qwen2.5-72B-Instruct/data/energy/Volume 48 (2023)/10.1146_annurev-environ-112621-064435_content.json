{"Abstract": "This paper examines the current and evolving legal and regulatory framework governing nuclear waste management in the United States, with a focus on both existing and advanced reactors and their fuel cycles. It analyzes the Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste, highlighting its implications for retrievability and long-term storage. The study also explores regulatory challenges and opportunities for advanced reactors, including the need for flexible and adaptive regulations to accommodate new fuel cycles and waste streams. Key findings include the importance of stakeholder engagement, technological innovation, and policy coherence to ensure safe and sustainable nuclear waste management."}
