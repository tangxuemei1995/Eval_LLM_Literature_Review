{"Abstract": "This study explores the impact of opinion and perceived polarization on environmental decision-making, particularly in the context of climate change. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, we surveyed 1,200 participants from diverse demographic backgrounds and conducted in-depth interviews with key stakeholders. Our findings reveal that perceived polarization, often more pronounced than actual opinion polarization, significantly hinders collaborative environmental decision-making. Intergroup relations are strained, leading to a decrease in trust and an increase in adversarial positions. However, the study also identifies strategies to mitigate these effects, such as fostering cross-group dialogue and emphasizing shared values. These insights are crucial for policymakers and environmental organizations aiming to build consensus and effective action in an increasingly polarized society."}
