{"Abstract": "This paper explores the multifaceted dimensions of the commons, focusing on the governance and management of common-pool resources (CPRs). Drawing from a wide array of case studies, the research highlights the critical role of collective action in sustaining common property regimes. It examines the principles of commoning, which emphasize community participation, equitable access, and adaptive management practices. The study also delves into the challenges posed by natural resource policy, including issues of overexploitation, external pressures, and institutional failures. By integrating insights from resource governance frameworks, the paper proposes a set of policy recommendations aimed at enhancing the resilience and sustainability of commons. These recommendations include the establishment of robust monitoring systems, the promotion of local knowledge, and the fostering of collaborative partnerships between communities and government agencies. The findings underscore the importance of a nuanced understanding of the social-ecological dynamics that underpin the commons, offering a foundation for more effective and equitable resource management."}
