{"Abstract": "This paper critically examines the concept of Great Green Walls (GGWs) as a strategy for combating desertification and promoting environmental rehabilitation in drylands, with a focus on the initiatives in the Sahel and China. While the idea of planting vast stretches of trees to halt desertification has gained significant traction and public imagination, the scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of GGWs is mixed. The paper reviews the ecological, social, and economic impacts of GGWs, highlighting both successes and challenges. Case studies from Algeria and China illustrate the complexities of implementing such large-scale afforestation projects, including issues of species selection, water management, and community engagement. The findings suggest that while GGWs can contribute to environmental rehabilitation, their success depends on a nuanced, context-specific approach that integrates local knowledge and adaptive management practices."}
