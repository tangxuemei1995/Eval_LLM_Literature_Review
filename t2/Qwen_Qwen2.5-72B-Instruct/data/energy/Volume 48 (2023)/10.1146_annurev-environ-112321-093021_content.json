{"Abstract": "Urban overheating, characterized by the urban heat island (UHI) effect, is a critical environmental issue exacerbating thermal discomfort and energy consumption in cities. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the magnitude and characteristics of urban overheating, its impacts on human health, infrastructure, and energy systems, and evaluates mitigation and adaptation strategies. The UHI effect can elevate urban temperatures by up to 10Â°C compared to rural areas, leading to increased mortality, higher energy demands, and reduced air quality. Mitigation strategies, such as green infrastructure, cool pavements, and urban planning, have shown promise in reducing surface and air temperatures. Adaptation measures, including heat action plans and public awareness campaigns, are essential for enhancing community resilience. Future challenges include integrating these strategies into urban development policies and addressing the disproportionate impacts on vulnerable populations. This comprehensive analysis highlights the need for interdisciplinary approaches to combat urban overheating and ensure sustainable urban environments."}
