{"Abstract": "The 30×30 initiative, which aims to conserve 30% of the Earth’s land and ocean by 2030, represents a significant milestone in the integration of climate change considerations into conservation strategies. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the historical context, current status, and future directions of climate change–integrated conservation efforts, with a particular focus on the 30×30 initiative. Historically, conservation efforts have often been reactive, addressing immediate threats to biodiversity without fully considering the long-term impacts of climate change. However, the increasing recognition of climate change as a primary driver of biodiversity loss has led to a paradigm shift towards more proactive and adaptive conservation strategies. The 30×30 initiative is a prime example of this shift, emphasizing the need for large-scale, interconnected protected areas that can support species migration and adaptation. The paper discusses the scientific underpinnings of the 30×30 target, including the role of systematic conservation planning in identifying priority areas for protection. It also highlights the importance of regional coordination and cross-border collaboration in ensuring the effectiveness of conservation efforts in the face of climate change. Case studies from various regions, such as the Amazon Basin and the Coral Triangle, illustrate the challenges and successes of implementing climate-resilient conservation strategies. Finally, the paper explores the future of climate change–integrated conservation, emphasizing the need for continued research, policy development, and community engagement to achieve the 30×30 goal and beyond. The integration of climate change biology into conservation planning is crucial for the long-term survival of species and the maintenance of ecosystem services, making the 30×30 initiative a pivotal step towards a more resilient and sustainable future."}
