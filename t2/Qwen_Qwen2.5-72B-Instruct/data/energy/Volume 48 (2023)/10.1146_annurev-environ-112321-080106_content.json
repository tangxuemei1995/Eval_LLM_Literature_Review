{"Abstract": "This paper explores recent advancements in qualitative methods within environmental research, emphasizing their role in understanding complex socioecological systems and the impacts of climate change. Qualitative approaches, including participatory research, ethnography, and narrative analysis, are increasingly recognized for their ability to capture the nuanced perspectives and lived experiences of individuals and communities. These methods facilitate a deeper understanding of how environmental changes are perceived and managed at local levels, providing critical insights that complement quantitative data. The paper also discusses the integration of qualitative methods with other research paradigms, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in addressing environmental challenges. Case studies from diverse geographical contexts illustrate the effectiveness of these methods in informing policy and practice, underscoring their potential to enhance the resilience and sustainability of socioecological systems."}
