{"Abstract": "This study examines the role of the Sea Around Us project in documenting and addressing human impacts on marine ecosystems through the lens of global fisheries science. By integrating data from artisanal, subsistence, and large-scale fisheries, the project provides a comprehensive assessment of the state of the world's oceans. Utilizing advanced data science techniques, the research highlights the critical importance of open data in supporting civil society and informing policy. The findings reveal significant declines in fish stocks and ecosystem health, emphasizing the need for sustainable practices and robust governance. The study underscores the project's contributions to global studies and its potential to drive positive change in marine conservation and fisheries management in the twenty-first century."}
