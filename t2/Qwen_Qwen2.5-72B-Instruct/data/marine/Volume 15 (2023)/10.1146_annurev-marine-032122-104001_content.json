{"Abstract": "This study explores the utility of nitrogen isotopes (δ15N) preserved in biomineralized fossils, specifically diatoms, foraminifera, and corals, to reconstruct ancient nutrient cycling and environmental conditions. By analyzing δ15N values in these microfossils from various geological periods, we gain insights into past oceanic nitrogen dynamics and their implications for paleoceanography. Diatoms, known for their silica-based frustules, provide a continuous record of surface ocean conditions, while foraminifera and corals offer deeper water column and reef environment perspectives. Our results indicate significant variations in δ15N values across different taxa and time periods, reflecting changes in nitrogen fixation, denitrification, and upwelling processes. These findings enhance our understanding of the interplay between biological productivity and oceanographic conditions in the past, and provide a robust framework for interpreting modern and future changes in marine ecosystems."}
