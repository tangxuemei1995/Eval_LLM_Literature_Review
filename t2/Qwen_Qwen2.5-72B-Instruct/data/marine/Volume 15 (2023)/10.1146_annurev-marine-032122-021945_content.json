{"Abstract": "Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS) are critical marine ecosystems that support high biological productivity and fisheries. This study investigates the impacts of climate change on EBUS, focusing on changes in wind patterns, sea surface temperature, and nutrient availability. Using a combination of historical data analysis, climate models, and field observations, we assess the variability and trends in upwelling intensity and timing. Results indicate a significant shift in upwelling dynamics, with potential implications for marine biodiversity and fisheries. Increased sea surface temperatures and altered wind patterns are projected to reduce upwelling intensity in some regions, while enhancing it in others. These changes could lead to shifts in species distribution and abundance, affecting the resilience of these ecosystems. The study highlights the need for adaptive management strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on EBUS and the communities that depend on them."}
