{"Abstract": "This study provides novel insights into marine iron (Fe) biogeochemistry by integrating iron isotope data from various marine environments, including dust, sediments, and hydrothermal vents. Utilizing the GEOTRACES framework, we elucidate the complex cycling of Fe in the ocean, highlighting the role of isotope fractionation in differentiating between natural and anthropogenic sources. Our findings reveal that dust inputs and hydrothermal vents contribute distinct Fe isotopic signatures, which are preserved in marine sediments. These signatures offer a powerful tool for tracing Fe sources and understanding their impact on marine productivity and carbon cycling. The results underscore the importance of iron isotopes in advancing our knowledge of ocean biogeochemistry and the global iron cycle."}
