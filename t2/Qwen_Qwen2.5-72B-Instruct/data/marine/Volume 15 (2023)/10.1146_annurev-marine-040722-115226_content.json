{"Abstract": "The ocean's biological pump plays a critical role in the global carbon cycle by sequestering atmospheric CO2 into the deep ocean. This study integrates satellite oceanography and biogeochemical modeling to quantify the efficiency and variability of the biological pump on global scales. We analyze carbon export pathways and their seasonal dynamics, revealing significant regional differences in carbon sequestration rates. Our findings highlight the importance of phytoplankton productivity and particle aggregation in enhancing carbon export. The model simulations suggest that changes in ocean temperature and nutrient availability could alter the pump's efficiency, with implications for future climate scenarios. This research provides a comprehensive assessment of the biological pump's impact on the ocean carbon cycle, emphasizing the need for continued monitoring and modeling efforts to predict its response to environmental changes."}
