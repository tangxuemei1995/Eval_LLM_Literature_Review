{"Abstract": "This study synthesizes proxy data and model simulations to reconstruct the global burial of marine carbonates during the Quaternary, focusing on glacial-interglacial cycles. The analysis reveals significant variability in carbonate burial rates, influenced by changes in ocean chemistry, sea level, and biological productivity. During glacial periods, reduced sea levels and altered ocean circulation patterns led to decreased carbonate burial in shallow marine environments, while interglacial periods saw enhanced burial due to higher sea levels and increased nutrient availability. Despite these insights, substantial uncertainties remain, particularly regarding the impact of ocean acidification and the role of deep-sea carbonate dissolution. Future research should aim to refine proxy records and improve model parameterizations to better constrain the long-term carbon cycle and its feedbacks with climate. This work underscores the importance of marine carbonates in the global carbon cycle and highlights the need for continued interdisciplinary research to address persisting uncertainties."}
