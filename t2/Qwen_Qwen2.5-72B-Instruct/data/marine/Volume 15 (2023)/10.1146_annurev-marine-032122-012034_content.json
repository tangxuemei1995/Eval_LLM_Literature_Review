{"Abstract": "The Beaufort Gyre, a key component of the Arctic Ocean's circulation system, plays a critical role in the distribution of freshwater and ocean heat content. This study examines the gyre's dynamics, influenced by wind patterns and sea ice cover, and its impact on the broader Arctic environment. Using a combination of in-situ observations and satellite data, we analyze the gyre's variability over the past two decades, highlighting significant changes in freshwater storage and heat fluxes. The findings underscore the gyre's sensitivity to climate change and its potential to affect global ocean circulation and climate patterns."}
