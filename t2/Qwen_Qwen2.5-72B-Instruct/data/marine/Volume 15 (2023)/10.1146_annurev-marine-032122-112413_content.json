{"Abstract": "This study employs nuclear reprocessing tracers, specifically 129I, to elucidate the complex flow features and connectivity between the Arctic and Subpolar North Atlantic Oceans. By analyzing the transit time distribution of 129I, we gain insights into the pathways and timescales of water mass transport. The results highlight the significance of the Fram Strait and the Greenland-Scotland Ridge in mediating the exchange of water masses. Enhanced tracer concentrations in specific regions suggest the presence of previously unidentified circulation patterns, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the Arctic-Atlantic circulation system. These findings have implications for climate modeling and the prediction of oceanic responses to environmental changes."}
