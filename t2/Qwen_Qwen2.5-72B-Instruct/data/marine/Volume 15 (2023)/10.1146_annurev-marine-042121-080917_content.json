{"Abstract": "Coral reef ecosystems are highly sensitive to environmental changes, and the interactions between microbes and dissolved organic matter (DOM) play a crucial role in their function and resilience. This study investigates how microbial communities process DOM, influencing nutrient cycling and oxygen dynamics. Microbiomes associated with coral reefs were found to rapidly degrade DOM, which can lead to localized deoxygenation events, particularly in areas with high organic matter input. These processes are essential for maintaining the balance of nutrients and can affect the overall health and resilience of coral reef ecosystems. Understanding these microbial interactions is vital for predicting and mitigating the impacts of environmental stressors on coral reefs, such as climate change and pollution."}
