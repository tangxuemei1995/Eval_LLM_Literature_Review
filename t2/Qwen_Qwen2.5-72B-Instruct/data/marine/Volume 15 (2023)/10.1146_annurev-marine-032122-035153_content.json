{"Abstract": "The biological carbon pump (BCP) plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle by transferring organic carbon from the surface ocean to the deep sea. This process, primarily driven by marine snow and fecal pellets, is subject to flux attenuation due to microbial degradation and zooplankton feeding. Marine snow, composed of aggregates of organic matter, serves as a vehicle for carbon export, while fecal pellets produced by zooplankton are more dense and sink faster, enhancing carbon sequestration. Microbial degradation, however, can significantly reduce the amount of carbon reaching the deep ocean. Understanding the dynamics of these processes is essential for predicting the efficiency of the BCP and its impact on climate regulation. This review synthesizes recent findings on the mechanisms governing carbon export, highlighting the interplay between biological, chemical, and physical factors that influence the BCP."}
