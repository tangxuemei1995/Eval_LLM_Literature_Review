{"Abstract": "This study explores the distribution, diversity, and metabolic activity of prokaryotes in the deep ocean's water column, a vast and largely unexplored habitat. Using advanced molecular techniques and in situ measurements, we characterized the bacterial and archaeal communities at various depths, revealing a high degree of vertical stratification and niche specialization. Our findings indicate that despite the extreme conditions, including high pressure and low nutrient availability, these microorganisms exhibit significant metabolic activity, contributing to key biogeochemical cycles. The discovery of novel taxa and metabolic pathways underscores the deep ocean's role as a reservoir of microbial diversity and functional potential, with implications for understanding the global carbon cycle and the limits of life on Earth."}
