{"Abstract": "Marine organisms exhibit a variety of biological rhythms that are synchronized with environmental cycles, including daily (circadian), tidal (circatidal), lunar (circalunar), and annual (circannual) rhythms. These rhythms are regulated by endogenous oscillators that allow organisms to anticipate and adapt to predictable changes in their environment. Recent studies have highlighted the complexity and diversity of these timing mechanisms across different marine taxa, from algae to animals. For instance, circadian rhythms in photosynthetic activity and gene expression have been well-documented in marine algae, while circatidal rhythms in behavior and physiology are prevalent in intertidal animals. Circalunar rhythms, such as reproductive cycles and migration patterns, are also crucial for many marine species. However, the impacts of climate change, including altered temperature and light regimes, pose significant challenges to these finely tuned biological clocks. Research is increasingly focusing on how these environmental perturbations affect the synchronization of endogenous oscillators and the potential consequences for marine ecosystems. Understanding these rhythms and their responses to environmental changes is essential for predicting and mitigating the effects of climate change on marine biodiversity."}
