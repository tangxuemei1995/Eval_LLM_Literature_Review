{"Abstract": "This study explores the modes and mechanisms of Pacific decadal-scale variability, focusing on the interplay between oceanic and atmospheric processes in the Pacific Ocean. Decadal-scale variability in the Pacific, characterized by shifts in sea surface temperature (SST) and atmospheric circulation patterns, significantly influences global climate patterns and regional weather phenomena. The research integrates observational data and climate model simulations to elucidate the role of ocean–atmosphere teleconnections, particularly the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), in modulating decadal variability. Key findings highlight the importance of subsurface ocean heat content, wind stress anomalies, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) in driving long-term climate fluctuations. The study also examines the potential impacts of anthropogenic climate change on the frequency and intensity of decadal-scale events, suggesting that warming trends may alter the traditional patterns of Pacific variability. These insights are crucial for improving climate prediction models and enhancing our understanding of the complex interactions within the Earth's climate system."}
