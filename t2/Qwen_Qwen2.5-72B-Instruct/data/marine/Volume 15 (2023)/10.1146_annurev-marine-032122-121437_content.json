{"Abstract": "Marine heatwaves (MHWs), defined as prolonged periods of anomalously high sea surface temperatures, are increasing in frequency and intensity due to climate change. This study synthesizes recent research on the biological impacts of MHWs across various marine ecosystems, including coral reefs, kelp forests, and open ocean environments. The findings highlight significant disruptions to ecosystem services, such as fisheries productivity and carbon sequestration, as well as shifts in species distributions and community compositions. MHWs have been linked to mass mortality events, reduced reproductive success, and altered phenological patterns in marine organisms. The cumulative effects of these extreme events exacerbate the challenges posed by ongoing ocean warming, leading to long-term environmental changes that may be irreversible. This review underscores the urgent need for adaptive management strategies and global efforts to mitigate climate change to preserve the integrity and resilience of marine ecosystems."}
