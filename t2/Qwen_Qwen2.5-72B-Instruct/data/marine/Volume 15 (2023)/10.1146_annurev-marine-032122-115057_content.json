{"Abstract": "This study investigates the mechanisms and dynamics of cross-shore exchange processes in the nearshore region, focusing on the transport of plankton, pollutants, and particles. Utilizing a combination of field observations and numerical modeling, we examine the roles of turbulence, wind, surface waves, and internal waves in facilitating these exchanges. Results indicate that surface waves and internal waves significantly enhance the vertical mixing and horizontal transport of particles, while wind-driven currents play a crucial role in the lateral distribution of pollutants. The study highlights the importance of these physical processes in shaping the nearshore ecosystem and the potential implications for environmental management and coastal zone protection."}
