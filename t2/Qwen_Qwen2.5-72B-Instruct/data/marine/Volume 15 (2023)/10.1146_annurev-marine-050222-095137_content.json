{"Abstract": "This paper presents an interdisciplinary journey from the collection of stamps to the exploration of parabolic shapes in nature, weaving together threads from oceanography, meteorology, geology, and paleontology. The narrative begins with a personal account of the author’s early fascination with stamp collecting, which sparked a lifelong curiosity about the natural world. This curiosity eventually led to a career in scientific research, where the author has made significant contributions to understanding the parabolic patterns observed in ocean currents, atmospheric phenomena, and geological formations. The paper highlights key findings from the author’s research, including the identification of parabolic structures in ancient sedimentary layers and the role of parabolic trajectories in the dispersal of prehistoric organisms. Additionally, the paper discusses the importance of education and outreach in fostering a broader appreciation for the interconnectedness of scientific disciplines. Through collaborative projects and public engagement initiatives, the author has worked to bridge the gap between academic research and public understanding, emphasizing the value of interdisciplinary approaches in addressing complex environmental and geological challenges. This autobiographical reflection serves as an inspiration for the next generation of scientists, encouraging them to pursue their passions and explore the rich tapestry of natural phenomena that surround us."}
