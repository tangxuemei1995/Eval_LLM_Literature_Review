{"Abstract": "This study evaluates the effectiveness of tidal wetlands, specifically marshes and mangroves, as nature-based solutions for coastal storm protection. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, we analyze the physical mechanisms by which these ecosystems mitigate the impacts of cyclones and hurricanes, including wave attenuation, storm surge reduction, and erosion control. The research highlights the critical role of vegetation structure and density in enhancing these protective functions. Additionally, we explore the integration of marshes and mangroves into coastal engineering strategies, emphasizing their potential to complement traditional hard infrastructure. The findings suggest that preserving and restoring these natural buffers can significantly enhance flood protection, offering a sustainable and cost-effective approach to coastal resilience. The study also identifies key challenges and opportunities for policymakers and practitioners in implementing nature-based solutions at scale."}
