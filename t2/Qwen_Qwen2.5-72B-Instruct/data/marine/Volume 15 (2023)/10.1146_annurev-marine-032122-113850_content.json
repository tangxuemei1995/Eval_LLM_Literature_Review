{"Abstract": "This paper explores the sociotechnical dimensions of ocean carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategies, integrating insights from climate finance, public perception, and environmental ethics. Ocean CDR, including methods such as seaweed cultivation and ocean alkalinity enhancement, holds significant potential for mitigating climate change. However, these technologies are not without controversy. The paper examines the financial mechanisms required to support large-scale deployment, the public's attitudes towards these interventions, and the ethical implications of altering marine ecosystems. It highlights the need for transparent governance frameworks and inclusive stakeholder engagement to ensure that ocean CDR aligns with broader sustainability goals. The findings underscore the importance of a balanced approach that considers both the technical feasibility and the social acceptability of these emerging technologies."}
