{"Abstract": "The Deepwater Horizon blowout in 2010 released an unprecedented amount of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, leading to extensive research on the mechanisms of oil transport and dispersion. This study investigates the key processes governing the spreading and dispersion of oil droplets, focusing on droplet formation and the role of eddy diffusivity in the marine environment. Using a combination of field data, laboratory experiments, and numerical simulations, we analyze the size distribution of oil droplets and their subsequent transport by ocean currents. Our findings indicate that the initial droplet size distribution is significantly influenced by the pressure and flow rate at the wellhead, while subsequent dispersion is dominated by turbulent mixing and eddy diffusivity. The results highlight the importance of these factors in predicting the fate and impact of oil spills, providing valuable insights for environmental monitoring and response strategies."}
