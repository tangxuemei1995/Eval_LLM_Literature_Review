{"Abstract": "Lipid biogeochemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the metabolic processes and environmental interactions of microorganisms in marine ecosystems. Recent advancements in lipidomic techniques, including high-resolution mass spectrometry and meta-omics approaches, have significantly enhanced our ability to identify and quantify complex lipid mixtures in environmental samples. These techniques provide insights into the biosynthesis, degradation, and cycling of lipids, which are essential biomarkers for microbial activity and community structure. This review highlights the integration of lipidomics with microbial oceanography and biogeochemistry, emphasizing the application of these tools to study lipid geochemistry in diverse marine environments. The synergistic use of lipidomics and meta-omics data offers a comprehensive view of the functional and ecological roles of lipids in marine biogeochemical cycles, contributing to a deeper understanding of the Earth's carbon and nutrient cycles."}
