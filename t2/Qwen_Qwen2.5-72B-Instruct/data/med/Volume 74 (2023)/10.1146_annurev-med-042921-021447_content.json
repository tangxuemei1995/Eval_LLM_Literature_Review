{"Abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. CFTR modulators, a class of drugs designed to correct the defective CFTR protein, have revolutionized CF treatment. This review summarizes the current landscape of CFTR modulator therapies, including their mechanisms of action, clinical efficacy, and safety profiles. Recent advancements in combination therapies have shown significant improvements in lung function and quality of life for CF patients, highlighting the potential for personalized medicine approaches in CF care."}
