{"Abstract": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) poses significant challenges to global public health efforts aimed at controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. These variants exhibit increased transmissibility, potential for immune evasion, and may lead to more severe disease outcomes. This review discusses the genetic characteristics of prominent VOCs, their impact on vaccine efficacy, and the implications for diagnostic testing and therapeutic strategies. Understanding the evolution and spread of these variants is crucial for developing adaptive public health interventions and mitigating the ongoing threat of COVID-19."}
