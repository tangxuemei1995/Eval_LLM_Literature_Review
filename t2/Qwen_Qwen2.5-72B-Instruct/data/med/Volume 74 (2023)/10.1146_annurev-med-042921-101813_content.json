{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in genomics, particularly through the application of massively parallel sequencing, have illuminated the unexpected role of rare genetic disorders in the etiology of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study employs collapsing analysis to aggregate rare variants within genes, revealing a significant association between specific genetic mutations and the development of CKD. The findings underscore the potential of precision medicine in tailoring therapeutic interventions for patients with genetic kidney diseases, highlighting the importance of comprehensive genetic screening in clinical practice. These insights not only enhance our understanding of the genetic architecture of CKD but also pave the way for more personalized and effective treatment strategies."}
