{"Abstract": "The emergence of COVID-19 has significantly impacted patients with kidney disease, particularly those with chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), and those undergoing dialysis or who have received a kidney transplant. This review synthesizes current evidence on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and kidney function, highlighting the increased risk of severe outcomes and mortality in these vulnerable populations. Data indicate that patients with CKD and ESKD are more susceptible to COVID-19 complications, including acute kidney injury and kidney failure requiring replacement therapy (KFRT). Additionally, the pandemic has disrupted routine care, leading to delayed treatments and potential exacerbation of underlying conditions. Strategies to mitigate these risks, such as prioritizing vaccination and optimizing telehealth services, are discussed. Understanding the specific challenges faced by kidney disease patients during the pandemic is crucial for improving clinical outcomes and healthcare delivery."}
