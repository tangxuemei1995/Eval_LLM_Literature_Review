{"Abstract": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disorder characterized by chronic inflammation and multi-organ involvement. Recent advancements in understanding the pathogenic role of interferon in SLE have paved the way for novel diagnostic biomarkers and targeted biologic therapies. This review highlights the latest diagnostic tools, including interferon signature testing, which can improve early detection and disease stratification. Additionally, emerging biologic agents, such as anti-interferon antibodies and B-cell depleting therapies, offer promising therapeutic options that may reduce disease activity and improve patient outcomes. These advancements underscore the importance of personalized medicine in the management of SLE, aiming to tailor treatments to individual patient profiles."}
