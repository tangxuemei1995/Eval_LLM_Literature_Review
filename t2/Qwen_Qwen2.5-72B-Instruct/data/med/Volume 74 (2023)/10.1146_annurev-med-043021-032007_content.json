{"Abstract": "This review summarizes current concepts in the gender-affirming care of transgender and gender-diverse youth, focusing on the use of pubertal blockers and gender-affirming hormone treatment. Pubertal blockers, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, are used to delay puberty and reduce gender dysphoria, providing time for psychological assessment and support. Gender-affirming hormone treatment, including estrogen or testosterone, is initiated to align physical characteristics with gender identity, improving mental health outcomes and quality of life. The review highlights the importance of multidisciplinary care, including psychological, medical, and social support, to ensure comprehensive and individualized care for these youth."}
