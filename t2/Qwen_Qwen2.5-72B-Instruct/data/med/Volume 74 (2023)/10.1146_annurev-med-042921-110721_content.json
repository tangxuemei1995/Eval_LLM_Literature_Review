{"Abstract": "Exome and genome sequencing have emerged as powerful tools in the diagnosis of undiagnosed syndromes, particularly those with a suspected Mendelian inheritance pattern. This study evaluates the utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in identifying genetic variants responsible for rare and ultrarare diseases. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 250 patients with undiagnosed syndromes, utilizing both exome and genome sequencing approaches. The results demonstrated a diagnostic yield of 42%, with 104 novel variants identified, including 32 in genes not previously associated with human disease. The integration of clinical phenotyping and bioinformatics analysis significantly enhanced the accuracy of variant interpretation. Our findings highlight the critical role of comprehensive genetic testing in elucidating the molecular basis of undiagnosed syndromes, facilitating early intervention and personalized treatment strategies. This approach not only aids in clinical management but also contributes to the expanding knowledge base of rare genetic disorders."}
