{"Abstract": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy represents a promising approach for treating hemophilia A and B, characterized by deficiencies in factor VIII and factor IX, respectively. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated sustained therapeutic levels of clotting factors following a single administration of AAV vectors, leading to reduced bleeding episodes and improved quality of life. However, challenges such as immune responses, vector manufacturing, and long-term safety remain. This review summarizes the current state of AAV gene therapy for hemophilia, highlighting recent advancements and discussing future directions to optimize therapeutic outcomes."}
