{"Abstract": "Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have emerged as a promising class of medications for improving kidney outcomes in both diabetic and nondiabetic kidney disease. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated significant reductions in the risk of kidney failure, albuminuria progression, and acute kidney injury. These benefits extend beyond glycemic control, suggesting a multifaceted mechanism of action that includes hemodynamic, anti-inflammatory, and metabolic effects. This review summarizes the current evidence supporting the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in kidney disease, highlighting their potential to reduce the burden of renal complications and improve patient outcomes."}
