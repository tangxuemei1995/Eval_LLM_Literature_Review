{"Abstract": "Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a recently recognized condition characterized by the expansion of hematopoietic stem cells with somatic mutations. This phenomenon is increasingly prevalent with age and has been linked to a higher risk of developing coronary artery disease (CAD), malignancies, and other adverse health outcomes. Recent studies have highlighted the role of DNA methylation in the clonal trajectories of CHIP, suggesting that epigenetic changes may contribute to the pathogenesis of associated diseases. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the mechanisms underlying CHIP, its impact on human health, and potential therapeutic strategies. By integrating genetic and epigenetic data, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how CHIP influences the risk of CAD and malignancy, and to identify biomarkers that could facilitate early detection and intervention."}
