{"Abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been associated with a high incidence of thrombotic complications, contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. This review summarizes the current understanding of the pathophysiology of thrombosis in COVID-19 and evaluates the efficacy and safety of anticoagulants and platelet aggregation inhibitors in managing these complications. Emerging evidence suggests that hypercoagulability in COVID-19 is multifactorial, involving inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and immune activation. Clinical trials have demonstrated that prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation can reduce the risk of venous and arterial thromboembolic events, although the optimal dosing and duration of treatment remain areas of active investigation. Platelet aggregation inhibitors, such as aspirin, have also shown promise, particularly in outpatient settings. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the therapeutic strategies and highlights the need for personalized approaches to antithrombotic therapy in COVID-19 patients."}
