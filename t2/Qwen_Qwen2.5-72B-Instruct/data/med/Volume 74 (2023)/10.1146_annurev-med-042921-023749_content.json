{"Abstract": "Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Despite significant advances, the detection and quantification of tau pathology in living patients remain challenging. This review highlights recent developments in tau biomarkers, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood-based assays, as well as imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET). These biomarkers offer promising tools for early diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. Additionally, the therapeutic landscape for tau-targeted interventions is evolving, with several compounds in clinical trials showing potential to reduce tau pathology and improve cognitive function. However, further research is needed to optimize these biomarkers and therapeutics for clinical use."}
