{"Abstract": "The global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has highlighted the complex interplay between the endocrine system and viral infections. This review examines the impact of COVID-19 on various endocrine disorders, including obesity, thyroid dysfunction, adrenal insufficiency, and pituitary disorders, as well as its effects on reproductive health. Emerging evidence suggests that individuals with pre-existing endocrine conditions are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes. The virus's interaction with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and its potential to induce cytokine storms contribute to endocrine dysregulation. Additionally, the psychological stress and lifestyle changes associated with the pandemic have exacerbated endocrine disorders. This review synthesizes current knowledge and identifies gaps in understanding, emphasizing the need for tailored management strategies to mitigate the endocrine complications of COVID-19."}
