{"Abstract": "Chronic neuromuscular respiratory failure necessitates long-term ventilatory support, often achieved through home assisted ventilation (HAV). This review examines the efficacy and patient outcomes of HAV, particularly focusing on noninvasive ventilation (NIV) methods. Studies indicate that NIV significantly improves quality of life, reduces hospital admissions, and enhances survival rates in patients with neuromuscular disorders. However, successful implementation of HAV requires careful patient selection, appropriate equipment, and ongoing monitoring to ensure optimal outcomes. This paper also discusses the challenges and considerations in the management of HAV, including patient adherence, technical issues, and the need for multidisciplinary care."}
