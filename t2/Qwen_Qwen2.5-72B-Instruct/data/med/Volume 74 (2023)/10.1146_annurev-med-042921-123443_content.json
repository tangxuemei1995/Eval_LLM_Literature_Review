{"Abstract": "Club cell secretory protein (CCSP), also known as CC10, uteroglobin, or secretoglobin 1A1 (SCGB1A1), is a multifunctional protein with significant roles in lung biology and disease. Emerging research highlights its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and protective properties in the airway epithelium. CCSP has been identified as a potential biomarker for various lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and lung cancer. Recent studies have explored its therapeutic potential, suggesting that CCSP could be used to modulate inflammatory responses and promote lung repair. This review summarizes the current understanding of CCSP's functions, its role as a biomarker, and its potential as a therapeutic target in lung diseases, providing insights into new treatment strategies."}
