{"Abstract": "Maternal mortality in the United States remains a significant public health concern, with persistent disparities across racial and socioeconomic groups. This study examines recent trends in maternal mortality rates and identifies key factors contributing to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Through a comprehensive review of national health data and literature, we highlight the critical role of preconception health and counseling in mitigating risks. Our findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to improve access to quality healthcare, particularly for high-risk populations. By addressing systemic barriers and enhancing preconception care, there is a substantial opportunity to reduce maternal mortality and improve maternal health outcomes in the United States."}
