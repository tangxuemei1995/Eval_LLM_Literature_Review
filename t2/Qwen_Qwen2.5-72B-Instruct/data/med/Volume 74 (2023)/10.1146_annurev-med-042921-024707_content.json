{"Abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a malignancy of the bile ducts, exhibits a high degree of genetic heterogeneity, with frequent alterations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene, including mutations, fusions, and amplifications. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of FGFR2 inhibition in CCA, focusing on the mechanisms of resistance and the efficacy of combination therapies. We analyzed a cohort of CCA patients and identified FGFR2 alterations in 15% of cases, including in-frame deletions and fusions with various partners. Treatment with FGFR2 inhibitors led to significant tumor regression in preclinical models, but resistance emerged through activation of alternative signaling pathways, such as RAS and EGFR. Combination therapy with MEK inhibitors and EGFR inhibitors was found to overcome resistance and enhance the therapeutic response. These findings highlight the importance of a comprehensive understanding of the genetic landscape of CCA and the development of targeted combination therapies to improve patient outcomes."}
