{"Abstract": "The ISCHEMIA trial provides critical insights into the management of stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD), comparing invasive and conservative approaches. The study, involving over 5,000 patients with stable angina and myocardial ischemia, demonstrated that optimal medical therapy (OMT) alone was non-inferior to an initial invasive strategy in reducing major cardiovascular events. Key lessons include the efficacy of OMT in managing symptoms and improving quality of life, the importance of patient selection for invasive procedures, and the need for personalized treatment plans. These findings underscore the value of a conservative approach as a first-line strategy in SIHD management."}
