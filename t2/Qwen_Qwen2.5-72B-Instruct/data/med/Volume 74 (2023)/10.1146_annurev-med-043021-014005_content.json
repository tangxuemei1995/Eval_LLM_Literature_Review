{"Abstract": "Sepsis and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) are complex critical care conditions characterized by heterogeneous clinical presentations. Recent advances in biological phenotyping have identified distinct subphenotypes that correlate with differential outcomes and treatment responses. This review synthesizes current literature on the identification and validation of these subphenotypes, emphasizing their potential to enhance precision medicine approaches. By integrating genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data, researchers have begun to delineate the molecular underpinnings of these subphenotypes, offering new insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets. Future studies should focus on validating these findings in diverse patient populations and translating them into clinical practice to improve patient outcomes."}
