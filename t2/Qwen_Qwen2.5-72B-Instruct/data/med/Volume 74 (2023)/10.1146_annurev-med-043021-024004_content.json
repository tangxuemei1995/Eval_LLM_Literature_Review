{"Abstract": "This study examines the origins and implications of racial and ethnic bias in pulmonary technologies, focusing on pulse oximetry and pulmonary function testing. We review the historical context and structural racism that have influenced the development and validation of these medical devices and algorithms. Disparities in accuracy and outcomes are analyzed, highlighting the need for more inclusive and representative data in the design and testing phases. The findings underscore the importance of addressing these biases to improve health equity and the reliability of pulmonary diagnostics across diverse populations."}
