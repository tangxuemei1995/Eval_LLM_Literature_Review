{"Abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin, leading to chronic hemolytic anemia and vaso-occlusive pain. Recent advancements in gene therapy offer promising therapeutic strategies to address the root cause of SCD. This review highlights diverse approaches, including hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplant, gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9, and gene addition via lentiviral vectors. HSC transplant has shown efficacy in correcting the disease, but its application is limited by the availability of matched donors. Gene editing techniques, particularly CRISPR, enable precise correction of the sickle mutation in HSCs, while lentiviral vectors facilitate the introduction of a functional Î²-globin gene. These approaches aim to achieve long-term correction and reduce the clinical burden of SCD, with ongoing clinical trials demonstrating initial success and safety profiles."}
