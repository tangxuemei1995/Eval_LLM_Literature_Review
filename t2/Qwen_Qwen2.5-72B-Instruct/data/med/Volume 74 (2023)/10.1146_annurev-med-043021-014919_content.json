{"Abstract": "This review explores the emerging role of GLP-1 receptor agonists and nutrient-stimulated hormone (NuSH)-based therapies in the treatment of obesity. Recent advancements in dual and triple receptor agonists have shown promising results in enhancing weight loss and metabolic control. These novel therapeutics, which mimic the effects of multiple gut hormones, offer a more comprehensive approach to managing obesity and related comorbidities. The integration of NuSH-based therapies further expands the therapeutic landscape, providing new opportunities for personalized and effective obesity treatment."}
