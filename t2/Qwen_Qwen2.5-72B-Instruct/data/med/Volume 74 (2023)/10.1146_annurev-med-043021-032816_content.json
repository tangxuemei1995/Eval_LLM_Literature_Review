{"Abstract": "Hepcidin, a peptide hormone primarily produced by the liver, plays a central role in regulating systemic iron homeostasis. This review explores the intricate relationship between hepcidin and iron metabolism in both health and disease. Under normal conditions, hepcidin maintains iron balance by inhibiting iron absorption from the diet and release from macrophages. However, dysregulation of hepcidin can lead to iron disorders such as anemia and iron overload. Inflammatory conditions, in particular, can elevate hepcidin levels, exacerbating anemia of chronic disease. Understanding the mechanisms of hepcidin regulation and its impact on iron metabolism is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies to treat iron-related disorders."}
