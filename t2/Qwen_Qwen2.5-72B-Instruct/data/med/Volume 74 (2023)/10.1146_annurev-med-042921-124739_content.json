{"Abstract": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains a significant complication in both solid organ transplant (SOT) and hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. Letermovir, a novel antiviral agent, has emerged as a promising therapeutic option for CMV prophylaxis and treatment. This review summarizes the current evidence on the efficacy and safety of letermovir in transplant recipients. Clinical trials have demonstrated that letermovir significantly reduces the incidence of CMV infection and disease in high-risk HCT patients, with a favorable safety profile. In SOT recipients, preliminary data suggest similar benefits, although more extensive studies are needed. Letermovir's unique mechanism of action, targeting the viral terminase complex, minimizes the risk of resistance and offers a valuable addition to the existing antiviral arsenal. This paper also discusses the optimal dosing strategies and potential drug interactions, highlighting the role of letermovir in the comprehensive management of CMV in transplant recipients."}
