{"Abstract": "Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) is a clinically significant condition that challenges traditional understandings of myocardial infarction (MI). This review synthesizes current knowledge on MINOCA, highlighting its prevalence, diagnostic criteria, and underlying mechanisms. MINOCA accounts for approximately 5-10% of all MIs and is associated with a diverse array of etiologies, including coronary spasm, takotsubo syndrome, and microvascular dysfunction. Advanced imaging techniques, such as coronary angiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, play crucial roles in diagnosing MINOCA and differentiating it from other forms of myocardial injury. The management of MINOCA is multifaceted, focusing on symptom relief, risk factor modification, and targeted therapies to address specific underlying causes. Future research is needed to elucidate the pathophysiology of MINOCA and to develop more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."}
