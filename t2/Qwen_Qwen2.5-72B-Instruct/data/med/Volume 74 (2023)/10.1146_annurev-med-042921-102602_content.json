{"Abstract": "The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway plays a crucial role in the regulation of erythropoiesis, particularly in conditions such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) where erythropoietin (EPO) production is impaired. Genetic and pharmacological perturbations of the HIF pathway have been explored to enhance erythropoiesis and mitigate anemia. HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs) stabilize HIF proteins, leading to increased EPO production and improved hematopoietic function. However, these interventions can also elevate the risk of thromboembolic events, highlighting the need for careful dose titration and patient monitoring. This review summarizes the current understanding of the HIF pathway's role in erythropoiesis, the mechanisms of action of HIF-PHIs, and the clinical implications of their use, including the potential for thromboembolism. The findings underscore the importance of balancing therapeutic benefits with safety considerations in the management of anemia associated with CKD and other hypoxic conditions."}
