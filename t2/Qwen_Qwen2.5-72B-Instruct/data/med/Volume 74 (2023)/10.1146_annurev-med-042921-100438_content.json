{"Abstract": "Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a common cause of secondary hypertension, characterized by excessive aldosterone production, leading to cardiovascular and renal complications. This review examines the role of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) in mitigating the adverse effects of PA on the heart and kidneys. MRAs, such as spironolactone and eplerenone, have been shown to reduce blood pressure, improve left ventricular hypertrophy, and slow the progression of chronic kidney disease. Clinical trials and observational studies highlight the efficacy and safety of MRAs in PA patients, emphasizing their potential to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, careful monitoring of potassium levels and renal function is essential to prevent hyperkalemia and renal impairment. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current evidence supporting the use of MRAs in the management of PA and its associated comorbidities."}
