{"Abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown remarkable efficacy in treating B-cell lymphomas; however, antigen loss remains a significant mechanism of resistance. This study explores the potential of multispecific CAR T cells, including bispecific and trispecific constructs, to overcome antigen escape. We engineered CAR T cells targeting CD19, CD20, and CD22, and evaluated their efficacy in vitro and in vivo. Multispecific CAR T cells demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity and persistence compared to single-target CAR T cells, effectively eliminating lymphoma cells that had lost one or more antigens. In a murine model of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, trispecific CAR T cells significantly prolonged survival and reduced tumor burden, even in the presence of antigen-heterogeneous tumors. These findings suggest that multispecific CAR T cells may provide a robust strategy to prevent antigen loss and improve clinical outcomes in lymphoma patients."}
