{"Abstract": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, with a substantial genetic component. Recent advances in genomics have enabled the development of polygenic scores (PGS) that quantify an individual's genetic risk for CAD. These scores, derived from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS), integrate the effects of multiple genetic variants to provide a more comprehensive risk assessment. This review highlights the latest developments in PGS for CAD, including improvements in score accuracy and the integration of environmental and lifestyle factors. We discuss the clinical applications of PGS in risk stratification, early intervention, and personalized prevention strategies. Additionally, we address the challenges and ethical considerations associated with the implementation of PGS in clinical practice, emphasizing the need for robust validation and equitable access. The potential of PGS to enhance CAD risk prediction and inform preventive measures underscores the importance of continued research in this field."}
