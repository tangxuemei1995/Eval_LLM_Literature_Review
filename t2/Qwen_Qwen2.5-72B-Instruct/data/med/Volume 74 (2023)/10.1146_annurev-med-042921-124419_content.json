{"Abstract": "This review examines the historical and contemporary use of race in kidney function estimation, highlighting the ethical and clinical implications of race-based adjustments in clinical algorithms. We discuss the scientific limitations and the perpetuation of health disparities associated with these practices. The paper advocates for the development and implementation of race-free equations to promote equity in kidney care, emphasizing the need for a multidisciplinary approach to address systemic biases and advance health justice."}
