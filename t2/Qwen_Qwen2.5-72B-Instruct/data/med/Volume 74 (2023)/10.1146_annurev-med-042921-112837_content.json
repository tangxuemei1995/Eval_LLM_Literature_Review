{"Abstract": "Cytokine Storm Syndrome (CSS) is a life-threatening condition characterized by an excessive and uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to systemic hyperinflammation. This syndrome encompasses a spectrum of disorders, including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), which are often triggered by infections, malignancies, or autoimmune diseases. The pathophysiology of CSS involves the activation of immune cells, such as macrophages and T lymphocytes, resulting in the overproduction of cytokines like IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-Î±. This cytokine surge can cause multi-organ dysfunction, cytolytic activity, and severe tissue damage. Early diagnosis and prompt therapeutic intervention, including immunomodulatory agents and cytokine-directed therapies, are crucial for improving outcomes in patients with CSS. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying CSS is essential for developing targeted treatments and preventing the devastating consequences of this syndrome."}
