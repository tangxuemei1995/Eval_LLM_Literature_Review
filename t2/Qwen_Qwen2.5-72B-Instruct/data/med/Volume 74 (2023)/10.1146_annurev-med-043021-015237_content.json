{"Abstract": "Vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare but serious adverse event associated with adenovirus vector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. This condition is characterized by the formation of autoantibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4), leading to platelet activation, thrombocytopenia, and thrombosis. Clinical manifestations of VITT can include cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. The incidence of VITT is estimated to be around 1 in 100,000 vaccine recipients, with a higher risk observed in younger individuals. Early recognition and prompt treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and non-heparin anticoagulants are critical for improving outcomes. This review summarizes the current understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of VITT, highlighting the importance of continued surveillance and research to mitigate this immunologic complication."}
