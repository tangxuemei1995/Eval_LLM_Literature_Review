{"Abstract": "This review provides an overview of the current state and future prospects of in situ sensors for coastal and ocean monitoring. The integration of advanced sensor networks has significantly enhanced our ability to collect real-time data on various oceanographic parameters, including temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen. However, challenges such as biofouling, power supply, and data transmission remain critical issues that limit the long-term deployment and reliability of these sensors. The review discusses recent advancements in sensor technology, including the development of anti-fouling coatings and energy-efficient designs, which are crucial for improving the performance and longevity of sensor networks. Additionally, the paper highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in addressing the complex challenges of coastal and ocean monitoring, emphasizing the need for robust data management and analysis frameworks to support informed decision-making in marine resource management and environmental conservation."}
