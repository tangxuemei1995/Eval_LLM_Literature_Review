{"Abstract": "This paper explores the integration of biosensors into a comprehensive knowledge network to enhance decision support and ensure meaningful use in healthcare settings. By leveraging advanced biosensor technology, the system captures real-time physiological data, which is then processed and analyzed to provide actionable insights. The focus is on improving the quality of service through continuous monitoring and predictive analytics, enabling healthcare providers to make informed decisions promptly. The study also addresses the challenges of data privacy, accuracy, and interoperability, proposing a robust framework to ensure the seamless integration of biosensors into existing healthcare infrastructures. The results highlight the potential of biosensor-driven knowledge networks to transform patient care and optimize resource utilization, ultimately leading to better health outcomes and enhanced patient satisfaction."}
