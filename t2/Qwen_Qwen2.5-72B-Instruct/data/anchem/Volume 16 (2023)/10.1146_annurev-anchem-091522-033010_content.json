{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of (photo)luminescent probes in data-enabled sensing, leveraging multidimensional fluorescence and phosphorescence techniques. By integrating advanced multivariate and N-way analysis methods, we enhance the sensitivity and specificity of luminescent probes for complex sample analysis. The use of image analysis further refines the detection capabilities, enabling the precise quantification and localization of target analytes in diverse environments. This approach not only improves the accuracy of sensing but also broadens the scope of applications in environmental monitoring, biomedical diagnostics, and material science."}
