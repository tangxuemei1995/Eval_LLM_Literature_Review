{"Abstract": "This study explores efficient validation strategies for the detection and quantification of organic micropollutants in water samples, emphasizing the integration of advanced chromatographic techniques and mass spectrometry. Method validation is crucial for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of analytical results, particularly in environmental monitoring. The research outlines a comprehensive approach to quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC), including the assessment of method precision, accuracy, linearity, limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantification (LOQ). Liquid and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS and GC-MS) are highlighted for their sensitivity and selectivity in analyzing a wide range of organic micropollutants, such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and industrial chemicals. The study also discusses the importance of matrix effects and the use of internal standards to mitigate potential interferences. Practical recommendations for implementing these validation strategies in routine environmental monitoring are provided, aiming to enhance the overall robustness and reproducibility of analytical methods."}
