{"Abstract": "The Deepwater Horizon oil spill released vast amounts of petroleum and petroleum-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) into the Gulf of Mexico, necessitating advanced analytical techniques to assess its environmental impact. This study explores emerging chemical methods, including inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and fluorescence spectroscopy, to characterize petrogenic DOM and black carbon. ICP-MS provides elemental and isotopic signatures, enabling the differentiation of natural and anthropogenic sources. Fluorescence spectroscopy offers a non-destructive approach to identify specific molecular components and track the transformation of DOM over time. These methods collectively enhance our understanding of the fate and behavior of petrogenic DOM in marine environments, contributing to more effective monitoring and remediation strategies following oil spills."}
