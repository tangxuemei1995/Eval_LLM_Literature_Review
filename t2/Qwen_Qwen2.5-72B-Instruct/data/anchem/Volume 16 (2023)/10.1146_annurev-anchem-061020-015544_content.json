{"Abstract": "This review highlights recent advancements and emerging medical applications of direct mass spectrometry (MS) technologies for tissue analysis, focusing on mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), ambient ionization techniques, and handheld MS-based devices. These technologies enable rapid, label-free molecular profiling of tissues, facilitating real-time clinical diagnostics and intraoperative decision-making. Ambient ionization methods, such as desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) and laser ablation electrospray ionization (LAESI), have been particularly impactful in clinical settings due to their ease of use and minimal sample preparation. Handheld MS devices, designed for point-of-care applications, offer the potential for on-site analysis, enhancing the accessibility and speed of diagnostic procedures. The integration of these MS technologies into clinical workflows promises to improve patient outcomes by providing more accurate and timely molecular information. This review also discusses the challenges and future directions in translating these innovative tools from the research laboratory to the clinical environment."}
