{"Abstract": "This review explores the application of advanced scanning probe methods, including atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM), scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), and scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM), in the electrochemical imaging of interfaces in energy storage systems, particularly batteries. These techniques offer high spatial resolution and the ability to probe local electrochemical activity, enabling a deeper understanding of interfacial phenomena. Recent advancements in automation and deep learning have further enhanced the capabilities of these methods, facilitating more efficient and accurate data acquisition and analysis. The review highlights key applications in battery research, such as the investigation of electrode degradation, electrolyte stability, and the formation of solid-electrolyte interphases. Future prospects, including the integration of multiple imaging modalities and the development of in situ and operando techniques, are also discussed, underscoring the potential for these methods to drive innovation in energy storage technology."}
