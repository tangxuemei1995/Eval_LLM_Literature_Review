{"Abstract": "This study presents a novel wearable microfluidic device designed for continuous biomarker sensing, integrating the principles of lab-on-chip technology with advanced microfluidic design. The device, fabricated using flexible materials, allows for real-time monitoring of physiological parameters, such as glucose, lactate, and electrolytes, directly from sweat or interstitial fluid. The microfluidic channels are optimized for minimal sample volume and rapid analyte detection, ensuring high sensitivity and specificity. The wearable nature of the device enhances user comfort and compliance, making it suitable for long-term health monitoring. Initial testing on human subjects demonstrated reliable and consistent performance, with the device showing potential for applications in chronic disease management, sports performance monitoring, and personalized medicine. The integration of wireless communication capabilities further enables seamless data transmission to mobile devices or cloud-based platforms for real-time analysis and feedback."}
