{"Abstract": "Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) is emerging as a powerful tool for nondestructive 3D pathology, offering high-resolution imaging with minimal tissue damage. This technique, combined with advanced computational and digital pathology methods, enables the detailed visualization of complex tissue structures and cellular interactions. LSFM facilitates optical-sectioning microscopy, which is crucial for spatial biology studies, allowing researchers to map the precise location and context of cellular events within tissues. This approach is particularly valuable in precision medicine, where accurate and comprehensive tissue analysis is essential for personalized treatment strategies. By integrating LSFM with translational research and clinical assays, this technology has the potential to significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic outcomes, paving the way for more effective and targeted medical interventions."}
