{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of nanoparticles as advanced tools for the interrogation of cell signaling pathways. By leveraging the unique properties of nanoparticles, including their ability to be manipulated magnetically and optically, we have developed a platform for intracellular sensing and quantitative imaging. These nanoparticles were designed to specifically target key signaling molecules, allowing for real-time monitoring of their activity within living cells. The magnetic manipulation capability enables precise control over the spatial distribution of the nanoparticles, facilitating the study of localized signaling events. Optical manipulation, on the other hand, provides a non-invasive means to activate or inhibit signaling pathways, offering unprecedented control over cellular processes. Our results demonstrate the potential of these nanoparticles to enhance our understanding of complex cell signaling networks, with implications for both fundamental research and therapeutic applications."}
