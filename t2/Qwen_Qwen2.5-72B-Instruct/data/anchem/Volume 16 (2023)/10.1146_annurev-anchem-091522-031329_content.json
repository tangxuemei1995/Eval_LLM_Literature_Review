{"Abstract": "This study explores the integration of next-generation ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) with mass spectrometry (MS) to enhance the depth and resolution of multidimensional analyses for biomolecules. By leveraging advanced IMS techniques, we achieve improved separation and structural elucidation of complex mixtures, facilitating more accurate molecular identification. The combined approach offers significant advantages in resolving isomers and conformers, providing deeper insights into the structural dynamics of biomolecules. This methodology is particularly valuable in proteomics and metabolomics, where detailed structural information is crucial for understanding biological processes and disease mechanisms."}
