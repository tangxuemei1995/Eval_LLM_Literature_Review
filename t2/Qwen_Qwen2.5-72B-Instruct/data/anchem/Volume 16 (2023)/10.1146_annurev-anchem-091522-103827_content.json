{"Abstract": "This review explores the application of microfluidic platforms in the study of biofilms, focusing on flow dynamics and shear stress effects. Microfluidic devices enable precise control over environmental conditions, facilitating in situ visualization of biofilm formation and development. These systems are crucial for understanding antifouling mechanisms and antimicrobial resistance, offering a high-throughput approach to screen potential therapeutic agents. Additionally, the integration of microfluidics with organ-on-chip and biosensor technologies enhances the physiological relevance of biofilm models, providing valuable insights into host-pathogen interactions and drug efficacy. This interdisciplinary approach paves the way for innovative solutions in biotechnology and medical research."}
