{"Abstract": "Recent advances in single-molecule tracking (SMT) and imaging techniques have significantly enhanced our ability to study the dynamics and interactions of individual molecules in complex biological systems. Techniques such as feedback-control tracking and point-spread-function (PSF) engineering have improved the precision and resolution of SMT, allowing for the accurate localization of molecules with nanometer-scale precision. Multiple plane microscopy (MPM) has further expanded the capabilities of SMT by enabling the simultaneous tracking of molecules in multiple focal planes, thus providing a more comprehensive view of molecular behavior in three-dimensional space. Advanced trajectory and clustering analysis methods have also been developed to extract meaningful information from the large datasets generated by these techniques, facilitating the identification of molecular interactions and the characterization of dynamic processes. These advancements collectively represent a significant leap forward in the field of single-molecule biophysics, opening new avenues for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of cellular processes."}
