{"Abstract": "Digital histopathology has been revolutionized by the integration of infrared spectroscopic imaging, offering a non-destructive, label-free method for detailed tissue analysis. This study explores the application of infrared spectroscopic imaging in conjunction with advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of digital pathology. By leveraging the chemical specificity of infrared spectroscopy, this approach provides high-resolution chemical images that can distinguish between healthy and diseased tissues with unprecedented precision. The integration of deep learning algorithms further automates the process, enabling rapid and accurate diagnosis. This research demonstrates the potential of infrared spectroscopic imaging to transform digital pathology, improving patient outcomes through more precise and timely diagnoses."}
