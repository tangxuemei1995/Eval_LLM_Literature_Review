{"Abstract": "This review examines the application of gels in microscale electrophoresis, focusing on capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) and microfluidic gel electrophoresis. Gels serve as sieving matrices, enabling the separation of biomolecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and glycans based on size and charge. The use of microscale formats offers enhanced resolution, faster analysis times, and reduced sample and reagent consumption. Recent advancements in gel formulations and microfabrication techniques have further improved the efficiency and versatility of these methods. This paper discusses the principles, advantages, and challenges of using gels in microscale electrophoresis, highlighting key applications in genomics, proteomics, and glycomics. The integration of these techniques with other microfluidic components is also explored, underscoring their potential for high-throughput and point-of-care diagnostics."}
