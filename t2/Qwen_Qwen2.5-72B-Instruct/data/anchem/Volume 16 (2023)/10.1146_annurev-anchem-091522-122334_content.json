{"Abstract": "This review provides an introductory overview of micro- and nanoscale electrochemical additive manufacturing (AM) techniques, focusing on electrodeposition, meniscus-confined electrodeposition (MCED), and electrohydrodynamic redox printing (EHD-RP). These methods leverage advanced tools such as nanopipettes, FluidFM, and scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) to achieve precise control over material deposition at the micro- and nanoscale. The article discusses the principles, advantages, and limitations of each technique, highlighting recent advancements and potential applications in fields such as microelectronics, biotechnology, and materials science. The aim is to serve as a comprehensive guide for researchers and engineers new to the field, facilitating the adoption and innovation of these cutting-edge AM technologies."}
