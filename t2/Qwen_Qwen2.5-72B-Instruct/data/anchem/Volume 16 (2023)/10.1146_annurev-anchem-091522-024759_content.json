{"Abstract": "This study explores the development and application of low-cost microfluidic systems for the rapid and accurate detection of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Utilizing paper-based microfluidics, we have designed and optimized a series of point-of-care (POC) testing devices that integrate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunochromatographic test (ICT) principles. These devices are capable of detecting specific biomarkers associated with NTDs such as leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis, and Chagas disease. The microfluidic platforms were validated using clinical samples, demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity comparable to conventional laboratory methods. The simplicity and cost-effectiveness of these POC tests make them particularly suitable for resource-limited settings, where NTDs are most prevalent. This research highlights the potential of microfluidic technology to improve clinical diagnosis and surveillance of NTDs, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes and disease control."}
