{"Abstract": "Insect populations worldwide are experiencing significant declines, prompting urgent calls for effective conservation strategies. This study employs population genomics to elucidate the genetic underpinnings of insect declines and to inform conservation efforts. Using advanced genome assembly techniques, we sequenced and analyzed the genomes of several key insect species, including bees, butterflies, and beetles, from diverse habitats. Our results reveal a high prevalence of deleterious mutations in declining populations, suggesting a reduced capacity for genetic adaptation to environmental changes. We also identified specific genomic regions under selection, which may be crucial for survival in fragmented and degraded habitats. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining genetic diversity and connectivity in insect populations to enhance their resilience. Furthermore, the study provides a framework for the application of conservation genomics in monitoring and managing insect populations, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches that combine genetic data with ecological and environmental information. This research contributes to a broader understanding of the genetic factors influencing insect conservation and offers practical insights for the development of targeted conservation strategies."}
