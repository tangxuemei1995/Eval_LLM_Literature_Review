{"Abstract": "The naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) is a unique rodent species that exhibits exceptional longevity and resistance to age-related diseases, including cancer. This review highlights the key biological mechanisms that contribute to the naked mole-rat's healthy aging, such as enhanced DNA repair, protein stability, and antioxidant defenses. The social structure of naked mole-rats, characterized by a eusocial organization, also plays a crucial role in their longevity and health. Additionally, their ability to tolerate hypoxic conditions provides insights into metabolic adaptations that may be harnessed to improve human healthspan. By elucidating these mechanisms, the naked mole-rat serves as a valuable model for understanding the genetic and environmental factors that promote healthy aging and could inform the development of therapeutic strategies to extend human longevity."}
