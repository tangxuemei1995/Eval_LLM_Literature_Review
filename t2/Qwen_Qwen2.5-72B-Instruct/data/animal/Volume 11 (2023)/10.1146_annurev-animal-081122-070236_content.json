{"Abstract": "This review synthesizes current scientific evidence on the efficacy and safety of cannabidiol (CBD) for managing diseases in dogs and cats, focusing on pharmacokinetics, anxiolytic effects, anti-inflammatory properties, and regulatory considerations. Recent studies have demonstrated that CBD can effectively reduce anxiety and inflammation, with promising results in managing epilepsy. Pharmacokinetic data indicate that CBD is well-absorbed and has a favorable safety profile, although dose-dependent side effects and drug interactions must be considered. Regulatory frameworks are evolving, reflecting the growing acceptance of CBD in veterinary medicine. However, further research is needed to establish standardized dosing protocols and to address long-term safety and efficacy. This review highlights the potential of CBD as a therapeutic option for various conditions in companion animals, while emphasizing the need for rigorous clinical trials to support its widespread use."}
