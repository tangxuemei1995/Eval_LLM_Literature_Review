{"Abstract": "Cephalopods, including octopuses, squids, and cuttlefish, exhibit a remarkable capacity for neural plasticity and complex behaviors. This study reveals extensive RNA editing, primarily mediated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR), which recodes the neural proteome in these animals. We identified a high frequency of RNA editing sites in cephalopod nervous systems, significantly more than in other invertebrates and vertebrates. These editing events often alter amino acid sequences, leading to functional changes in proteins crucial for neural function. The prevalence of RNA editing in cephalopods suggests a potential mechanism for rapid adaptation and behavioral flexibility. Our findings highlight the evolutionary significance of RNA editing in cephalopods and provide insights into the molecular basis of their unique cognitive abilities."}
