{"Abstract": "Biologging and biotelemetry technologies have revolutionized our understanding of marine animal behavior, physiology, and ecology. These tools enable the continuous monitoring of movement patterns, diving behavior, and physiological responses in natural environments, providing critical insights into movement ecology, field physiology, predatorâ€“prey interactions, and social dynamics. Recent advancements in miniaturization and data transmission have expanded the scope of studies to include a broader range of species, from small fish to large marine mammals. This review highlights key findings from biologging and biotelemetry studies, emphasizing the role of these technologies in elucidating the impacts of anthropogenic stressors such as climate change, pollution, and human disturbance on marine ecosystems. By integrating data from multiple sources, researchers can develop more comprehensive models of marine animal behavior and inform conservation strategies to protect vulnerable species and their habitats."}
