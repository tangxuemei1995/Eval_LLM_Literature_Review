{"Abstract": "This study explores the mechanisms that maintain recessive lethal alleles in natural populations, focusing on mutation–selection balance, heterozygote advantage, and linked selection. Using a combination of population genetic models and empirical data, we investigate how these processes interact to preserve genetic variation despite the fitness costs associated with lethal mutations. Our findings suggest that while mutation–selection balance plays a fundamental role, heterozygote advantage and associative overdominance due to linked selection can significantly contribute to the persistence of recessive lethals. These results highlight the importance of considering the broader genetic architecture, including the presence of supergenes, in understanding the maintenance of deleterious alleles. The implications of these findings extend to conservation genetics and the management of genetic disorders in both wild and managed populations."}
