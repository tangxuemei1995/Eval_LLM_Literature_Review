{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of forensic techniques, particularly DNA analysis, in the prosecution of wildlife poaching cases. By examining case studies from various jurisdictions, the research highlights the challenges and successes of using scientific evidence to identify poachers and protect endangered species. The findings underscore the critical role of interdisciplinary collaboration between law enforcement, forensic scientists, and legal professionals in strengthening the legal framework for wildlife crime. The study also discusses the ethical considerations and potential improvements in evidence collection and preservation to enhance the admissibility and impact of forensic evidence in court."}
