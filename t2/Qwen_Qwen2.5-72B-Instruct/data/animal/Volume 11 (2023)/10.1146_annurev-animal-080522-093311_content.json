{"Abstract": "Deleterious mutations pose significant challenges to the genetic health and long-term viability of natural populations, particularly in the context of conservation biology. This study employs simulations to explore the accumulation and purging of deleterious variants in various population structures, emphasizing the role of genetic load and inbreeding depression. Results indicate that small, isolated populations are particularly vulnerable to the accumulation of deleterious mutations, leading to reduced fitness and increased extinction risk. However, moderate levels of gene flow can mitigate these effects by facilitating the purging of deleterious alleles. These findings underscore the importance of maintaining genetic diversity and connectivity in conservation efforts to enhance the resilience of endangered species. Implications for management strategies, such as genetic rescue and habitat restoration, are discussed."}
