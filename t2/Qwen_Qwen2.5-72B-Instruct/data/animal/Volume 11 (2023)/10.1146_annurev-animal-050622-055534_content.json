{"Abstract": "This study aimed to identify genetic risk factors for both monogenic and complex diseases in Canis lupus familiaris, utilizing a comprehensive genomic approach. By leveraging the dog as an animal model, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to pinpoint specific genetic variants associated with diseases such as hip dysplasia, epilepsy, and cancer. Our findings highlight the potential of precision medicine in veterinary practice, aligning with the One Health initiative to improve health outcomes for both animals and humans. The identified genetic markers provide valuable insights for early diagnosis and targeted therapeutic interventions, contributing to the advancement of veterinary medicine and the broader field of genetic research."}
