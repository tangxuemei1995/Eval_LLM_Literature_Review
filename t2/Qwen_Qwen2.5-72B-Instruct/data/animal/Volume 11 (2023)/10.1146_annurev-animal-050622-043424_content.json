{"Abstract": "This study explores the unique biological and evolutionary traits of fierce females, specifically focusing on the talpid mole and the spotted hyena. Both species exhibit remarkable examples of female masculinization, a phenomenon characterized by the development of male-like traits in females. In moles, this is evident through the presence of an ovotestis, a gonad that contains both ovarian and testicular tissue, which may influence aggressive behavior. Similarly, female spotted hyenas possess a pseudopenis, a masculinized clitoris that closely resembles a penis, and exhibit dominant and aggressive behaviors typically associated with males. These traits are hypothesized to confer evolutionary advantages, such as increased social dominance and reproductive success. This research integrates morphological, hormonal, and behavioral data to elucidate the mechanisms underlying female masculinization and its ecological implications."}
