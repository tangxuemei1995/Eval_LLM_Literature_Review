{"Abstract": "This study explores the evolutionary history of key vertebrate hormones and their receptors, focusing on leptin, oxytocin, vasopressin, prolactin, and ghrelin, by analyzing the genomes of non-osteichthyan vertebrates, including cartilaginous fishes and cyclostomes. Comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses reveal the presence of orthologs and paralogs of these hormones and their receptors, providing insights into their ancestral functions and the timing of gene duplications. The findings suggest that the hormonal systems in these early vertebrates were more complex than previously thought, with implications for the evolution of endocrine regulation in vertebrates. This research enhances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the diversification of hormonal signaling pathways and their roles in the adaptation of vertebrates to various ecological niches."}
