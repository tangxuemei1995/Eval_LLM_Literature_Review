{"Abstract": "This review examines the role of domestic animals as reservoir hosts for zoonotic viral diseases, highlighting their significance in the emergence and maintenance of both endemic and novel viral pathogens. Domestic animals, including livestock and pets, can serve as intermediate hosts, facilitating the spillover of viruses from wildlife to humans. The study synthesizes data from recent outbreaks, such as influenza, coronaviruses, and henipaviruses, to illustrate the complex interplay between animal husbandry practices, environmental factors, and human behavior. The One Health approach is emphasized as a critical framework for integrated surveillance, prevention, and control strategies to mitigate the risk of future pandemics. The findings underscore the need for enhanced monitoring and collaborative efforts across veterinary, public health, and ecological disciplines to address the growing threat of zoonotic diseases."}
