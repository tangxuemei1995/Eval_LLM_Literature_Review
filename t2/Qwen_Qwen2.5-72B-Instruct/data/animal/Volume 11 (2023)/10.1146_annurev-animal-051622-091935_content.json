{"Abstract": "This review explores the integration of Indigenous perspectives within the field of animal biosciences, emphasizing the contributions of American Indian and Native American communities. Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) offers a holistic approach to animal health and management, aligning with the One Health framework that recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health. The review highlights case studies where TEK has been successfully applied, such as in wildlife conservation, livestock management, and disease surveillance. It also addresses the challenges and barriers to incorporating Indigenous knowledge into mainstream animal biosciences, including issues of cultural appropriation, intellectual property rights, and the need for respectful, collaborative research practices. The paper concludes with recommendations for fostering greater collaboration between Indigenous communities and the scientific community to enhance the sustainability and ethical standards of animal biosciences."}
