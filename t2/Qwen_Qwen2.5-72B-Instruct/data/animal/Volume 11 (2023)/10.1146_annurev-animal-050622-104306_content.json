{"Abstract": "This paper explores the evolving role of zoos and aquariums in the context of global biodiversity conservation, environmental education, and scientific research. As natural habitats face increasing threats, these institutions have become crucial for captive breeding programs and species reintroduction efforts, contributing to the preservation of endangered species. Additionally, they serve as vital educational platforms, raising public awareness about environmental issues and fostering a deeper understanding of the natural world. However, the paper also addresses the ethical considerations surrounding animal welfare in captivity, emphasizing the need for continuous improvement in living conditions and enrichment programs. Through a review of recent literature, this study highlights the multifaceted contributions of zoos and aquariums and suggests strategies for enhancing their impact in a rapidly changing world."}
