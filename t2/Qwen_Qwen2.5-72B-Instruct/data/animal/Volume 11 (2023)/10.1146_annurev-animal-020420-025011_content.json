{"Abstract": "Emerging human-infecting coronaviruses (CoVs) pose significant public health threats, often originating from zoonotic reservoirs and crossing species barriers through complex mechanisms. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the role of animal models in understanding the biology and transmission dynamics of these viruses. We highlight the importance of bats, rodents, and various domestic and wild animals as potential reservoirs, emphasizing the role of recombination events in generating novel viral strains. The use of animal models, including mice, ferrets, and non-human primates, has been crucial in elucidating viral pathogenesis, immune responses, and the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Surveillance strategies are discussed, focusing on the identification of high-risk interfaces where cross-species transmission is most likely to occur. Understanding these processes is essential for developing effective prevention and control measures to mitigate the impact of future zoonotic outbreaks."}
