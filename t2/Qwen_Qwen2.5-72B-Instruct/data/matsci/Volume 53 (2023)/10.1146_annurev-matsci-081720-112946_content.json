{"Abstract": "The use of tailor-made additives in the melt crystallization process of molecular crystals is explored to understand their impact on crystal morphology and properties. This study investigates the role of additives in the formation of spherulites and twisted crystals, with a particular focus on the influence of chirality and polarity. Through a combination of experimental techniques and computational modeling, we demonstrate that the strategic introduction of additives can significantly alter the growth kinetics and the final crystal structure. The results indicate that additives with complementary chirality and polarity to the host molecules can promote the formation of unique crystal morphologies, such as twisted spherulites, which exhibit enhanced optical and mechanical properties. However, the effectiveness of these additives is highly dependent on their concentration and the specific molecular interactions within the crystalline system. This research provides valuable insights into the design of additives for the controlled growth of molecular crystals, highlighting both the potential benefits and the challenges associated with this approach."}
