{"Abstract": "This study investigates the unique properties of low-dimensional and confined ice, focusing on its crystal growth, morphology, and physical properties. Using advanced characterization techniques, we explore how confinement in nanoscale environments affects the formation and stability of ice structures. Our findings reveal that the morphology of ice in confined spaces deviates significantly from bulk ice, exhibiting distinct low-dimensional structures. These structures display altered optical and mechanical properties, which are crucial for understanding ice behavior in various natural and technological contexts. The interface between ice and confining materials plays a critical role in determining the growth kinetics and final morphology of the ice crystals. This research provides valuable insights into the fundamental aspects of ice formation and has implications for fields such as materials science, environmental science, and cryobiology."}
