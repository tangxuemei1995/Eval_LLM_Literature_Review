{"Abstract": "This review focuses on the recent advancements in the application of hydrous transition metal oxides (HTMOs) for electrochemical energy storage and conversion, as well as environmental remediation. HTMOs, characterized by their unique structural water content, exhibit remarkable electrochemical properties that make them promising candidates for various applications. The presence of structural water facilitates ion insertion and de-insertion processes, enhancing the rate capability and cycling stability of these materials. This work highlights the role of structural water in modulating the electrochemical performance of HTMOs, including their use in supercapacitors, batteries, and water splitting. Additionally, the environmental applications of HTMOs, such as the removal of heavy metals and organic pollutants from water, are discussed. The review also addresses the challenges and future perspectives in the design and synthesis of HTMOs to optimize their performance for practical applications."}
