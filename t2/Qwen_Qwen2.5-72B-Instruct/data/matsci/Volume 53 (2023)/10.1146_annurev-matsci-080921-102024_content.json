{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of dynamic in situ electron microscopy (DISEM) to observe live-action single-atom catalysis, marking a significant advancement in the field of chemical research. By integrating advanced microscopy techniques with real-time catalytic processes, we were able to visualize the structural and chemical transformations of single-atom catalysts under reaction conditions. The results provide unprecedented insights into the mechanisms of catalytic activity and stability, revealing the dynamic nature of single-atom sites and their interactions with reactants. This approach not only enhances our fundamental understanding of catalytic processes but also opens new avenues for the design and optimization of more efficient and robust catalysts. The implications of these findings are far-reaching, potentially impacting areas such as energy conversion, environmental remediation, and industrial chemistry."}
