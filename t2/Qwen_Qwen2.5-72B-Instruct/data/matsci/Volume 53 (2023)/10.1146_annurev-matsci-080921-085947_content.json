{"Abstract": "The success of machine learning (ML) in materials science hinges on the effective representation of materials' properties and structures. This review explores various representation methods, including feature engineering techniques that capture the essential characteristics of materials, such as chemical composition, crystal structure, and electronic properties. We discuss the application of generative models to create new materials with desired properties, and the integration of graph-based and spectral methods to represent complex crystal structures. The review highlights the importance of domain-specific knowledge in feature selection and the potential of deep learning approaches to automate the representation process. Case studies demonstrate the impact of these methods on predicting material properties and accelerating materials discovery."}
