{"Abstract": "Polar metals, a class of materials that simultaneously exhibit metallic conductivity and spontaneous electric polarization, have emerged as a fascinating subject of condensed matter physics. This review explores the fundamental principles and recent advancements in the field of polar metals, with a focus on perovskite-based materials. The coexistence of ferroelectricity and metallicity, often mutually exclusive properties, is discussed in the context of improper ferroelectricity, where the polarization arises from a structural distortion rather than a direct charge displacement. Recent experimental and theoretical studies have unveiled the unique electronic and magnetic properties of these materials, opening new avenues for applications in next-generation electronic devices. The prospects for engineering polar metals with tailored functionalities through strain engineering and interface design are also highlighted, underscoring the potential of these materials in advanced technological applications."}
