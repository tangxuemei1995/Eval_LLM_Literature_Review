{"Abstract": "This study investigates the mechanisms and microstructural outcomes of extreme abnormal grain growth (EAGG) in polycrystalline materials. By examining the interplay between grain boundary energy and mobility, we elucidate the conditions under which EAGG occurs, leading to the formation of exceptionally large grains. The role of Zener pinning, where second-phase particles impede grain boundary motion, is critically assessed to understand its impact on the grain growth kinetics. Experimental results and microstructural analyses reveal that a combination of high grain boundary energy and reduced pinning effectiveness can trigger EAGG, resulting in a bimodal grain size distribution. These findings provide insights into the control of microstructure in materials processing, with implications for enhancing mechanical properties and performance."}
