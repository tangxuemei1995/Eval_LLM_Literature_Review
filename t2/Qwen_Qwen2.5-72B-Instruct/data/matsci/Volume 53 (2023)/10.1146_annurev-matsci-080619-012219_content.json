{"Abstract": "Ionic gating has emerged as a powerful technique for modulating the electronic and magnetic properties of materials, particularly in transition metal oxides, magnetic thin films, and van der Waals 2D materials. This method involves the controlled movement of ions within a material, which can induce significant changes in its electronic structure and magnetic behavior. Recent studies have demonstrated that ionic gating can enhance superconductivity in certain materials, stabilize novel magnetic phases, and even enable the reversible tuning of electronic properties. These advancements have significant implications for the development of next-generation electronic and spintronic devices, including those for neuromorphic computing. This review highlights the latest progress in ionic gating techniques, their impact on material properties, and the potential applications in advanced technological systems."}
