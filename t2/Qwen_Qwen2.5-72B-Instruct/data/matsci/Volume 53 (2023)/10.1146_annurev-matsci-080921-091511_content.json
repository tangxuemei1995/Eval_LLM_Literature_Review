{"Abstract": "Grain boundary migration is a critical process in the evolution of microstructure in polycrystalline materials, significantly influencing their mechanical and physical properties. This study investigates the mechanisms and kinetics of grain boundary migration in various polycrystalline systems, focusing on the role of thermal energy, applied stress, and solute segregation. Through a combination of experimental techniques, including electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and computational modeling, we elucidate the factors that govern grain growth and the stability of grain boundaries. The findings reveal that the migration rate is highly dependent on the grain boundary character and the presence of impurities, which can either enhance or impede the movement of grain boundaries. These insights provide a foundation for the development of advanced materials with tailored microstructures and improved performance."}
