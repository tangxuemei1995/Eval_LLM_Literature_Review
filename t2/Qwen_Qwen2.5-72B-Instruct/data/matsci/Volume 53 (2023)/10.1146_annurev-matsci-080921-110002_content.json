{"Abstract": "This study explores the design principles for noncentrosymmetric materials, focusing on their unique properties such as nonlinear optical responses, magnetism, and the presence of skyrmions. By leveraging topological protection and manipulating the electronic structure, we identify key factors that enhance the functionality of these materials. Our findings reveal that the absence of inversion symmetry in noncentrosymmetric materials leads to a rich interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom, enabling the stabilization of exotic magnetic states and robust topological phenomena. Through a combination of theoretical modeling and experimental validation, we demonstrate how specific crystallographic configurations and chemical compositions can be tailored to optimize nonlinear optical properties and magnetic behavior. These insights provide a roadmap for the development of advanced materials with potential applications in spintronics, quantum computing, and nonlinear optics."}
