{"Abstract": "High-dimensional survival analysis is a critical area in precision medicine, where the number of potential predictors often far exceeds the number of observations. This paper reviews recent advancements in methods and applications, focusing on feature screening, machine learning, and artificial neural networks. We discuss the integration of these techniques to enhance statistical inference and predictive accuracy in survival models. Through case studies in oncology and cardiology, we demonstrate how these methods can identify significant biomarkers and improve patient risk stratification. The application of these advanced analytical tools not only aids in personalized treatment planning but also contributes to the broader goals of data science in healthcare."}
