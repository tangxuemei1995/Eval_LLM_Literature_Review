{"Abstract": "This paper explores six statistical senses that are essential for robust data analysis: bootstrap, data augmentation, exchangeability, likelihood, propensity score, and randomized replication. These methods enhance the reliability and validity of statistical inferences, particularly in complex datasets. By integrating probabilistic sampling and shrinkage estimation, we demonstrate how these senses can be effectively applied to improve model accuracy and reduce bias. The paper provides a comprehensive overview and practical guidelines for their implementation."}
