{"Abstract": "This paper provides an interdisciplinary perspective on generative models, integrating insights from computer science, statistics, and decision-making. We explore the application of generative models in simulation and experimental design, highlighting their role in creating realistic scenarios for testing and validation. The paper discusses the use of agent-based models and particle filters to simulate complex systems, emphasizing their utility in understanding emergent behaviors and decision-making processes. We also examine methods for model evaluation, including goodness-of-fit techniques, to ensure that generative models accurately represent the underlying data and processes. Through case studies and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the versatility and power of generative models across various domains, from social sciences to engineering."}
