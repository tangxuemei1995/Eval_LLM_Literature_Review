{"Abstract": "This study explores the development and evaluation of fair risk algorithms in the context of criminal justice, focusing on reducing discrimination while maintaining predictive accuracy. By integrating principles of optimal transport and machine learning, we propose a novel framework that ensures fair representation of different demographic groups in risk assessment. The algorithm is designed to minimize disparate impact while accurately predicting recidivism risk. Through extensive experimentation on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of both fairness and predictive performance. The results highlight the potential of optimal transport techniques in conformation prediction, offering a promising direction for the ethical deployment of risk assessment tools in criminal justice systems."}
