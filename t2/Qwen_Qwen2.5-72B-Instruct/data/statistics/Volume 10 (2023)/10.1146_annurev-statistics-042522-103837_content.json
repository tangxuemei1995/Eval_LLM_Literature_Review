{"Abstract": "This review synthesizes recent advancements in the methodologies of generalizability and transportability, focusing on their implications for external validity and causal inference. Generalizability concerns the extent to which findings from a study can be applied to a broader population, while transportability addresses the applicability of these findings across different settings or contexts. We examine the role of treatment effect heterogeneity in these processes, highlighting the importance of identifying and adjusting for covariates that influence the external validity of study results. The review also discusses the use of statistical and machine learning techniques to enhance the transportability of causal effects, including propensity score methods, inverse probability weighting, and targeted maximum likelihood estimation. Through a critical analysis of empirical studies, we identify key challenges and propose strategies to improve the robustness and reliability of generalizable and transportable inferences in various research domains."}
