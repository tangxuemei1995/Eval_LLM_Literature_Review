{"Abstract": "The detection of exoplanets using radial velocity (RV) measurements is a complex task, often complicated by correlated noise and uneven sampling. This study presents advanced statistical methods to address these challenges, focusing on the accurate modeling of RV time series data. We employ multivariate time series analysis to account for the interdependencies in RV signals and develop robust models for noise characterization. Model comparison techniques, including Bayesian model selection, are utilized to assess the presence of exoplanets and to evaluate the impact of model misspecification. Our methods are validated using both simulated and real RV data, demonstrating improved detection rates and reduced false positives. The results highlight the importance of rigorous statistical approaches in exoplanet detection, particularly in the presence of complex noise structures and sparse data."}
