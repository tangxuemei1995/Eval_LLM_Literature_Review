{"Abstract": "The Cox proportional hazards model, introduced in 1972, has become a cornerstone in survival analysis, providing a robust framework for analyzing time-to-event data. Over the past five decades, the model has been extended and refined to address a wide range of complexities, including time-dependent covariates, recurrent events, and competing risks. This review examines the evolution of the Cox model, highlighting key advancements such as the partial likelihood approach, which allows for the estimation of regression coefficients without fully specifying the baseline hazard. The paper also discusses the integration of intensity and marginal rate models, which have enhanced the model's applicability in scenarios with multiple event types and censoring mechanisms. Recent developments in handling independent censoring and the incorporation of machine learning techniques are explored, underscoring the model's continued relevance and adaptability. Through a comprehensive analysis of the literature, this review aims to provide a clear understanding of the Cox model's impact and its ongoing role in advancing survival analysis."}
