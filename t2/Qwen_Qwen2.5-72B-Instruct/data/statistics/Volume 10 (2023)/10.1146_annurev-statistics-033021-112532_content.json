{"Abstract": "This study explores the integration of diverse data types within Bayesian phylogenetic frameworks, leveraging advanced statistical models such as Bayesian networks, continuous-time Markov processes, and Gaussian processes. The primary objective is to enhance the accuracy and robustness of phylogenetic inference and comparative methods by incorporating multiple sources of data, including molecular sequences, morphological traits, and geographic information. We demonstrate how Bayesian networks can effectively model complex dependencies among different data types, while continuous-time Markov processes provide a flexible framework for modeling evolutionary changes over time. Gaussian processes are utilized to account for spatial and temporal correlations in phylogeographic studies, improving the estimation of ancestral states and migration patterns. Through a series of simulations and empirical analyses, we show that data integration significantly enhances the resolution and reliability of phylogenetic trees and comparative inferences, particularly in scenarios with limited or heterogeneous data. This approach has broad implications for phylogenetic comparative methods and phylogeography, offering a powerful tool for understanding the evolutionary history and biogeography of species."}
