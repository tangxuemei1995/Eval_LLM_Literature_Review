{"Abstract": "This study explores the dynamics of innovation diffusion processes, focusing on the role of competition, critical diffusion points, and structured interventions. Utilizing a comprehensive innovation diffusion model, the research integrates nonlinear regression techniques to analyze the impact of word-of-mouth and structured interventions on the adoption rate of new technologies. The findings reveal that critical diffusion points significantly influence the speed and extent of innovation adoption, with structured interventions playing a crucial role in accelerating this process. The model also highlights the importance of competition in shaping diffusion patterns, suggesting that strategic interventions can mitigate competitive pressures and enhance the diffusion of beneficial innovations. This study contributes to the theoretical understanding of innovation diffusion and provides practical insights for policymakers and practitioners aiming to foster the adoption of new technologies."}
