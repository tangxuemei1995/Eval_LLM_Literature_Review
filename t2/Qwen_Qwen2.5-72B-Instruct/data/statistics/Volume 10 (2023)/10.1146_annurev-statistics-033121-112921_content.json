{"Abstract": "This paper explores the intricate balance between statistical data privacy and utility, focusing on the methodologies and frameworks that ensure data confidentiality while maintaining the integrity and usefulness of statistical analyses. We delve into the principles of statistical disclosure control (SDC) and formal privacy models, with a particular emphasis on differential privacy, a robust framework that provides strong privacy guarantees. The paper discusses the challenges and trade-offs involved in implementing these techniques, including the impact on data utility and the potential for inference attacks. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical studies, we highlight the advancements in privacy-preserving techniques and propose future directions for research to enhance both privacy and utility in statistical data analysis."}
