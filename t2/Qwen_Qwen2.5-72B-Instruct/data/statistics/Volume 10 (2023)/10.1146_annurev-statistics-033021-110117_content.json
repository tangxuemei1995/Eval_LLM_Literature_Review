{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of machine learning techniques to player tracking data in sports, focusing on the extraction of latent variables that can enhance predictive models. By leveraging spatiotemporal data, we develop a framework that captures the dynamic interactions between players and their environment. The proposed method, which integrates advanced feature engineering and deep learning architectures, demonstrates significant improvements in predicting player movements and game outcomes. Our findings highlight the potential of latent variable models in uncovering hidden patterns and informing strategic decisions in sports analytics."}
