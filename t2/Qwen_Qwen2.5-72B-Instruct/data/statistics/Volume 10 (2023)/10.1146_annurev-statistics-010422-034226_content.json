{"Abstract": "The 2020 US Census of Population and Housing implemented advanced statistical disclosure limitation techniques, including differential privacy, to protect individual confidentiality while maintaining data utility for redistricting and other critical applications. This approach ensures that the risk of re-identifying individuals from published data is minimized, thereby enhancing public trust and participation in the census process. The implementation of these methods represents a significant advancement in balancing privacy concerns with the need for accurate and reliable demographic data."}
