{"Abstract": "This paper explores the advancements in simulation-based Bayesian analysis, focusing on computational methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA), and Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMPs). We review the capabilities of popular statistical software tools, including BUGS, Stan, and JAGS, in facilitating Bayesian inference and graphical model construction. The discussion highlights the efficiency and flexibility of these tools in handling complex models and large datasets, emphasizing their role in modern Bayesian computation. Through case studies and practical examples, we demonstrate the application of these methods in various fields, showcasing the potential of simulation-based approaches in advancing Bayesian analysis."}
