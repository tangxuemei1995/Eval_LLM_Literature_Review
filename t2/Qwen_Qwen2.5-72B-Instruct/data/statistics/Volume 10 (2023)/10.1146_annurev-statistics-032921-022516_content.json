{"Abstract": "This study explores advanced models for integer data, focusing on univariate distributions and time-series models. We examine the application of thinning operators in constructing integer-valued autoregressive processes, which are essential for modeling count data. The Skellam distribution, characterized by the difference of two independent Poisson-distributed random variables, is highlighted for its utility in capturing overdispersion and zero-inflation. Through simulations and real-world applications, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these models in various fields, including ecology, finance, and epidemiology. The results underscore the importance of selecting appropriate distributions and operators to accurately model integer data, enhancing predictive accuracy and interpretability."}
