{"Abstract": "Surrogate endpoints are biomarkers intended to substitute for clinical outcomes in clinical trials, aiming to expedite drug development and regulatory approval. This review examines the criteria for validating surrogate endpoints, focusing on the Prentice criteria, which require a surrogate to be causally related to the clinical outcome and to capture the treatment effect. Recent advancements in causal inference methods, such as principal stratification, have enhanced the evaluation of surrogates by addressing the surrogate paradox, where a surrogate may appear effective while the treatment has no impact on the clinical outcome. We discuss the application of these methods in various therapeutic areas and highlight the challenges in establishing causal effectiveness and causal association. The review underscores the importance of rigorous validation to ensure that surrogate endpoints accurately reflect the clinical benefit of interventions, thereby improving the reliability and efficiency of clinical trials."}
