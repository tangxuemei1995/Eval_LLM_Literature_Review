{"Abstract": "This paper introduces and evaluates three-decision methods as a more nuanced and practical approach to significance testing. Unlike traditional binary hypothesis testing, which often leads to oversimplified conclusions, three-decision methods allow researchers to make more informed decisions by considering not only the null and alternative hypotheses but also the possibility of inconclusive results. This framework is grounded in decision theory and enhances the sensitivity and power of statistical tests, particularly in the context of multiple testing. Through simulations and real-world applications, we demonstrate that three-decision methods can reduce Type I and Type II errors while providing a more comprehensive understanding of the data. The implications for sensitivity analysis and the broader field of statistical inference are discussed, highlighting the potential for these methods to improve the reliability and interpretability of research findings."}
