{"Abstract": "This paper reviews approximate methods for Bayesian computation, focusing on techniques such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), Bayesian synthetic likelihood, coresets, divide and conquer, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and subsampling. These methods are essential for handling complex models and large datasets, providing efficient and scalable solutions to Bayesian inference problems. The review highlights the strengths and limitations of each approach, offering insights into their practical applications and future research directions."}
