{"Abstract": "This study introduces a novel graph-based change-point analysis method for detecting abrupt changes in high-dimensional and non-Euclidean data. By leveraging nonparametric graph-based tests and scan statistics, the proposed method effectively identifies change points without assuming a specific distribution of the data. The approach constructs a graph from the data, where nodes represent observations and edges are weighted based on a similarity measure. Change points are detected by evaluating the tail probability of the scan statistic over subgraphs, allowing for the identification of local changes in network structures. The method is validated through extensive simulations and real-world applications, demonstrating superior performance in detecting change points in complex, high-dimensional datasets compared to existing methods. This work has significant implications for various fields, including social network analysis, bioinformatics, and financial market monitoring."}
