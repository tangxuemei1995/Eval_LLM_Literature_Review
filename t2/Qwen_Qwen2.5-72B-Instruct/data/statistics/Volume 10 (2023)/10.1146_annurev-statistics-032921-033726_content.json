{"Abstract": "This study introduces the concept of second-generation functional data, which encompasses spatial, longitudinal, and multivariate functional data, as well as functional time series. We extend traditional functional principal component analysis (FPCA) to accommodate these complex data structures, providing a robust framework for dimension reduction and feature extraction. The proposed methods are validated through simulations and applied to real-world datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness in capturing the intrinsic variability and temporal/spatial dependencies. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the specific characteristics of second-generation functional data in statistical modeling, leading to improved accuracy and interpretability in various applications, including environmental monitoring, biomedical research, and financial analysis."}
