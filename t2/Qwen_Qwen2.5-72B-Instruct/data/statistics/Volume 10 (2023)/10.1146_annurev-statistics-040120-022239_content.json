{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of the empirical bootstrap and multiplier bootstrap methods in high-dimensional data settings, leveraging the high-dimensional central limit theorem. We address challenges in multiple testing and simultaneous inference, demonstrating the effectiveness of these bootstrap techniques in controlling family-wise error rates and false discovery rates. Through extensive simulations and real data applications, we provide evidence of the robustness and accuracy of these methods in high-dimensional contexts."}
