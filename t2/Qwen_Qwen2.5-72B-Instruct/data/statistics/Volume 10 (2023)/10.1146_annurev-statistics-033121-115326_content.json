{"Abstract": "Model-based clustering is a powerful approach for identifying groups within complex datasets by leveraging probabilistic models, particularly mixture models. This method employs the expectationâ€“maximization (EM) algorithm to iteratively estimate the parameters of the underlying distributions, thereby assigning data points to clusters. Bayesian inference further enhances the robustness of the clustering process by incorporating prior knowledge and uncertainty. Recent advancements in computational methods and software have made model-based clustering more accessible and efficient, enabling its application in a wide range of fields, from genomics to market segmentation. This review discusses the theoretical foundations, practical considerations, and software tools available for model-based clustering, highlighting its advantages and limitations in handling high-dimensional and heterogeneous data."}
