{"Abstract": "This paper explores the development of sustainable statistical capacity-building initiatives in Africa, with a specific focus on biostatistics. The importance of robust biostatistical skills in addressing public health challenges and advancing research is underscored. The paper highlights the role of Southâ€“North collaboration in fostering educational programs, research partnerships, and consulting services that enhance human capital. It discusses successful models of capacity-building, including the establishment of regional training centers and the integration of practical, data-driven projects into curricula. The paper also examines the challenges of resource constraints, brain drain, and the need for continuous professional development. Recommendations include the creation of a pan-African network of biostatisticians, increased funding for local institutions, and the development of tailored training programs that align with regional health priorities. The ultimate goal is to build a self-sustaining biostatistical workforce capable of driving evidence-based decision-making and innovation in Africa."}
