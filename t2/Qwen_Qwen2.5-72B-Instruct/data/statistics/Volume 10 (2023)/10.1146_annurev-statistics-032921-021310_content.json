{"Abstract": "This review examines recent advancements in shared frailty methods for analyzing complex survival data, including clustered, recurrent, and competing event data. We discuss the application of accelerated failure time models, Cox regression, and modern machine learning techniques such as regression trees and random survival forests. These methods account for unobserved heterogeneity and dependencies within clusters, enhancing the accuracy of survival predictions. The review highlights the strengths and limitations of each approach, providing guidance for researchers in selecting appropriate models for their data."}
