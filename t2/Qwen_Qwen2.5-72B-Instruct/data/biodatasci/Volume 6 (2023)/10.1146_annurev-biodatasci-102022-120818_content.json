{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in multiomics technologies have significantly enhanced our understanding of the genetic architecture underlying human diseases, revealing the critical role of gene interactions, or epistasis, in disease susceptibility and progression. This review synthesizes emerging evidence from large-scale genomic studies, highlighting the complexity and non-linear nature of gene interactions in various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and neurodegenerative conditions. Multiomics approaches, integrating genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, have provided unprecedented insights into the molecular mechanisms through which gene interactions modulate disease phenotypes. These findings underscore the importance of considering epistatic effects in precision medicine, where personalized treatment strategies can be tailored based on an individual's unique genetic and molecular profile. However, the identification and functional characterization of gene interactions remain challenging due to the high dimensionality and heterogeneity of biological data. Future research should focus on developing robust computational models and experimental frameworks to systematically dissect the intricate web of gene interactions, ultimately translating these insights into clinical applications for improved patient outcomes."}
