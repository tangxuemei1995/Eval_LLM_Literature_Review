{"Abstract": "Virus-derived small RNAs (vsRNAs) and virally encoded microRNAs (v-miRNAs) play crucial roles in viral infection, host immune modulation, and disease progression. This review focuses on the biogenesis, function, and bioinformatics analysis of v-miRNAs, particularly those from Epsteinâ€“Barr virus (EBV). Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing and computational tools have facilitated the identification and characterization of these regulatory RNAs, providing insights into their mechanisms of action and potential therapeutic targets. The integration of viral RNA bioinformatics resources with experimental data enhances our understanding of the complex interplay between viral and host gene expression, highlighting the significance of v-miRNAs in both health and disease."}
