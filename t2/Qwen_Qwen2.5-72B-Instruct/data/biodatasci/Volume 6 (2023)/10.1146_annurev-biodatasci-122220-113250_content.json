{"Abstract": "Precision medicine aims to tailor healthcare to individual genetic profiles, yet the majority of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted in populations of European ancestry, limiting the generalizability of genetic associations. This review highlights the critical importance of diversity in GWAS to enhance the identification of disease susceptibility variants across different ancestry groups. We summarize recent findings from diverse cohorts and consortia, demonstrating that the inclusion of underrepresented populations can uncover novel genetic loci and improve the accuracy of polygenic risk scores (PRS). The analysis of multi-ethnic datasets reveals that PRS developed in European populations often perform poorly in non-European groups, underscoring the need for more inclusive study designs. By integrating data from diverse populations, precision medicine can achieve greater equity and effectiveness in disease prediction and treatment, ultimately benefiting a broader spectrum of patients."}
