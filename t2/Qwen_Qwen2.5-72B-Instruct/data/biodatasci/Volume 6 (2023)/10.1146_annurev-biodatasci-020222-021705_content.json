{"Abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a global pandemic, with significant variability in the clinical outcomes of infected individuals. This study investigates the genetic basis of severe COVID-19 pneumonia through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and the analysis of rare variants. We identified several common variants associated with increased susceptibility to severe disease, including loci near genes involved in type I interferon signaling. Additionally, we discovered rare inborn errors of immunity, such as mutations in genes encoding key components of the type I interferon pathway, which are overrepresented in patients with critical illness. These findings highlight the critical role of genetic factors in the host response to SARS-CoV-2 and provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for the management of severe COVID-19 pneumonia."}
