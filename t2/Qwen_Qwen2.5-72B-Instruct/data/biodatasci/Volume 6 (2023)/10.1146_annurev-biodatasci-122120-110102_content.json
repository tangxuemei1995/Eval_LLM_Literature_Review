{"Abstract": "This study aims to identify functional sequences and variants in noncoding DNA, crucial for gene regulation. Utilizing machine learning and deep learning techniques, we analyzed whole genome sequencing data to predict the effects of rare variants on enhancer activity and transcription. Our approach integrates genome-wide association studies to pinpoint specific noncoding regions associated with complex traits. The results highlight the importance of noncoding DNA in disease susceptibility and provide a framework for variant effect prediction, advancing our understanding of genetic regulation and its implications in human health and disease."}
