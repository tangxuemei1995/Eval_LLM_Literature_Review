{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in computational methods have significantly enhanced the capabilities of structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) in drug discovery. This review highlights the integration of ultralarge libraries, machine learning, and deep learning techniques to improve the efficiency and accuracy of SBVS. The use of GPU acceleration and free energy simulations has further optimized the screening process, enabling the rapid identification of potential drug candidates from vast chemical spaces. Molecular docking, a cornerstone of SBVS, has been refined through these technological advancements, leading to more reliable predictions of ligand-protein interactions. The application of these methods in various therapeutic areas demonstrates their potential to accelerate the early stages of drug development, reducing both time and cost. This review also discusses the challenges and future directions in the field, emphasizing the need for continued innovation to address the complexity of biological systems."}
