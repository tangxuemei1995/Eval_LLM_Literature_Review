{"Abstract": "Single-cell multiomics represents a transformative approach in biological research, enabling the simultaneous analysis of multiple molecular layers within individual cells. This technique integrates various omics data, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics, to provide a comprehensive understanding of cellular heterogeneity and function. Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing and computational methods have facilitated the development of multimodal platforms that can efficiently process and integrate these complex datasets. These platforms not only enhance our ability to identify rare cell types and states but also reveal intricate regulatory networks and dynamic cellular processes. The integration of single-cell multiomics data has significant implications for fields such as developmental biology, immunology, and cancer research, offering new insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. However, the computational challenges associated with data integration and interpretation remain a critical area for ongoing research and innovation."}
