{"Abstract": "Aging is characterized by a complex interplay of molecular and cellular changes, collectively known as aging hallmarks. This study employs advanced single-cell analysis tools to dissect these hallmarks at an unprecedented resolution, revealing distinct cellular and molecular signatures across various tissues. By integrating comprehensive data resources, we identify key intervention targets and mechanisms that could be harnessed to mitigate age-related decline. Our findings provide a robust framework for understanding the heterogeneity of aging processes and pave the way for personalized anti-aging strategies."}
