{"Abstract": "Breast cancer risk assessment is a critical component in early detection and personalized treatment strategies. This study explores the integration of molecular and radiomic features to enhance risk prediction accuracy. We utilized a cohort of 500 breast cancer patients, combining single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and polygenic risk scores (PRS) with radiomic features extracted from mammographic images. Machine learning algorithms were employed to develop a comprehensive risk assessment model. The results demonstrate that the combined model significantly outperforms models based solely on genetic or radiomic data, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89. This integrated approach not only improves risk stratification but also provides insights into the biological mechanisms underlying breast cancer development. The findings suggest that combining molecular and radiomic features can lead to more accurate and personalized risk assessment, potentially enhancing early detection and treatment planning."}
