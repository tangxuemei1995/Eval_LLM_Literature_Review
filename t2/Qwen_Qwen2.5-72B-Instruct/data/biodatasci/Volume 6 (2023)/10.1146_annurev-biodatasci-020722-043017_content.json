{"Abstract": "This review explores the integration of microbiome data, particularly from 16S rRNA gene sequencing and whole-genome sequencing (WGS), into biomedical data science to elucidate the role of the human microbiome in disease. Advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the generation of vast datasets, which, when analyzed using sophisticated data science techniques, can reveal microbial signatures associated with various diseases. The review discusses the challenges and opportunities in handling large-scale microbiome data, including data preprocessing, normalization, and the application of machine learning algorithms to identify biomarkers. Case studies highlighting the impact of microbiome research on conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and cancer are presented, underscoring the potential for personalized medicine and therapeutic interventions. The integration of multi-omics data further enhances the understanding of host-microbiome interactions, paving the way for novel diagnostic and treatment strategies."}
