{"Abstract": "The genomic analysis of admixed populations presents unique challenges and opportunities for understanding the genetic basis of complex traits. This review outlines advanced strategies and methods for dissecting the genetic architecture of admixed populations, focusing on the integration of ancestry information and statistical genetics. We discuss the application of admixture mapping, local ancestry inference, and multi-way admixture models to identify genetic variants associated with complex traits. Additionally, we highlight the importance of accounting for population stratification and the use of machine learning approaches to enhance the power and precision of genetic association studies. These methodologies not only improve our understanding of the genetic diversity within admixed populations but also have significant implications for personalized medicine and public health."}
