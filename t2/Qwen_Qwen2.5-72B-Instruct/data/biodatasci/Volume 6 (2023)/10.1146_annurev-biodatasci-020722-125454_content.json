{"Abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neuropsychiatric condition characterized by a wide range of symptoms and phenotypic expressions. Recent advancements in data science and machine learning have opened new avenues for understanding and managing ASD. This review synthesizes the current state of research on the application of data science and machine learning to the neuropsychiatric phenotype of autism, highlighting key findings and methodologies. We explore the use of digital phenotyping, which leverages mobile and wearable devices to collect real-time data, providing a more granular and dynamic view of ASD symptoms. Machine learning algorithms, particularly those based on deep learning and natural language processing, have shown promise in identifying patterns and predicting outcomes in large, heterogeneous datasets. Crowdsourcing platforms have also emerged as valuable tools for data collection, enabling the aggregation of diverse and representative samples. However, challenges remain, including data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the need for robust validation of digital biomarkers. This review outlines a roadmap for future research, emphasizing the integration of multimodal data, the development of explainable AI models, and the importance of stakeholder engagement in the design and implementation of digital health interventions. By addressing these challenges, data science and machine learning can significantly enhance our understanding of ASD and improve clinical outcomes for individuals with the disorder."}
