{"Abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for dissecting the heterogeneity of human cancers. This technology enables the profiling of gene expression at the single-cell level, providing unprecedented insights into the complex cellular composition of tumors and their microenvironments. Recent advancements in bioinformatics have further enhanced the ability to analyze and interpret scRNA-seq data, facilitating the identification of novel cell types, states, and interactions. These findings have significant implications for understanding tumor biology, predicting patient outcomes, and developing targeted immunotherapies. This review summarizes the current state of scRNA-seq in cancer research, highlighting key applications and future directions in the field."}
