{"Abstract": "This review provides an overview of the application of deep generative models, including variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), in the fields of functional and evolutionary genomics. These models have shown significant potential in generating synthetic genomic data, imputing missing values, and uncovering latent biological structures. We discuss the theoretical foundations of these models and their specific adaptations for genomic data, highlighting recent advancements and challenges. Case studies in gene expression analysis, epigenetic regulation, and phylogenetic inference illustrate the practical utility of deep generative models. The review also addresses the ethical considerations and future directions for integrating these models into genomic research, emphasizing their role in enhancing our understanding of complex biological systems."}
