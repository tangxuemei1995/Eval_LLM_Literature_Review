{"Abstract": "The development of broad-spectrum vaccines against rapidly mutating viruses, such as influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and HIV, remains a significant challenge in the field of vaccinology. These viruses exhibit high genetic variability, which allows them to evade immune responses and rapidly develop resistance to existing vaccines. Recent advances in immunology and molecular biology have led to the identification of conserved epitopes and the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that can target multiple strains of these viruses. This review highlights the progress made in designing universal vaccines that elicit broad-spectrum immunity, including the use of mosaic antigens, nanoparticle platforms, and computational methods to predict and optimize immunogenicity. Despite these advancements, several hurdles remain, including the need for more effective adjuvants, the optimization of vaccine delivery systems, and the development of robust correlates of protection. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the successful deployment of broad-spectrum vaccines that can provide long-lasting protection against a wide range of viral variants."}
