{"Abstract": "This paper explores the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in addressing biomedical data inequality, a critical issue that exacerbates health disparities across diverse populations. We analyze the challenges posed by subpopulation shift and data inequality, which often result in biased AI models that perform poorly on underrepresented groups. The study proposes a multiethnic machine learning framework that leverages transfer learning techniques to improve model generalization across different demographic subgroups. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our approach can significantly reduce performance disparities and enhance health equity. The findings highlight the potential of AI to mitigate data inequality and underscore the importance of inclusive data practices in biomedical research."}
