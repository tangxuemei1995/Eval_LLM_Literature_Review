{"Abstract": "Alternative splicing plays a crucial role in generating proteomic diversity from a limited number of genes. This study integrates short-read and long-read RNA-seq data with top-down mass spectrometry to comprehensively identify splice variants and protein isoforms. Short-read RNA-seq provides high coverage and accuracy for gene expression quantification, while long-read RNA-seq captures full-length transcripts, enabling the identification of novel splice variants. Top-down mass spectrometry further validates these findings at the protein level, distinguishing between proteoforms that arise from alternative splicing and post-translational modifications. Our integrated approach reveals a significant number of previously unannotated splice variants and protein isoforms, highlighting the complexity of the transcriptome and proteome. This work underscores the importance of combining multiple omics technologies to gain a more complete understanding of gene expression and protein function in biological systems."}
