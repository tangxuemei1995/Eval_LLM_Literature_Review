{"Abstract": "Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has revolutionized prenatal care by enabling the detection of fetal genetic abnormalities through the analysis of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and RNA (cfRNA) in maternal blood. Recent advances in genomics and liquid biopsy techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and scope of NIPT, allowing for the detection of chromosomal aneuploidies, single-gene disorders, and even epigenetic markers. However, challenges remain, including the need for more comprehensive coverage of genetic conditions, improved sensitivity and specificity, and the ethical implications of expanded testing. This review discusses the current state of NIPT, highlighting recent technological advancements, ongoing challenges, and the potential future directions for integrating cfDNA and cfRNA analysis into routine prenatal care."}
