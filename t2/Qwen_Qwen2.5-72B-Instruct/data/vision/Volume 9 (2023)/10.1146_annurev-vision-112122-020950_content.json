{"Abstract": "The retina, a complex neural tissue responsible for visual processing, undergoes significant structural and functional changes with aging. This review examines the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying age-related alterations in retinal neurons and synapses. Recent studies have identified key proteins and signaling pathways that contribute to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal degeneration, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and impaired protein homeostasis. Advanced imaging techniques and transcriptomic analyses have revealed distinct molecular landscapes in aging retinal layers, highlighting the heterogeneity of age-related changes. These findings provide insights into the progressive decline in visual function and suggest potential therapeutic targets for age-related retinal diseases. Understanding the intricate interplay between structural integrity and functional performance in the aging retina is crucial for developing interventions to preserve vision in the elderly population."}
