{"Abstract": "This paper explores the perceptual science underpinning augmented reality (AR) display systems, focusing on how visual perception interacts with AR technologies. We review the latest advancements in AR display systems, including optical see-through and video see-through displays, and discuss their implications for visual perception. Key findings highlight the importance of accurate depth cues, color consistency, and motion parallax in enhancing the realism and usability of AR experiences. The paper also addresses the challenges of perceptual latency and visual discomfort, proposing solutions to mitigate these issues. By integrating insights from cognitive and perceptual psychology, this research aims to inform the design of more effective and user-friendly AR systems."}
