{"Abstract": "Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of childhood blindness, primarily affecting preterm infants. This condition arises from abnormal retinal vascularization, driven by dysregulated angiogenesis in response to fluctuating oxygen levels. Key factors include the interplay between maternalâ€“fetal interactions and the expression of growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Cell signaling pathways, particularly those involving hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ROP. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing targeted therapies to prevent or mitigate the progression of this debilitating condition."}
