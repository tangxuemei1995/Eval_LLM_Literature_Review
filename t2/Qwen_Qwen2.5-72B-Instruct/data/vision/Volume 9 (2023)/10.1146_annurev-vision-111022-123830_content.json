{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of ultra-high field fMRI (7T and above) in the detailed imaging of human visual cognition, focusing on cortical layers and columnar structures. Advanced imaging techniques enable the visualization of subcortical regions with unprecedented resolution, enhancing our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying visual processing. The results demonstrate the potential of ultra-high field fMRI to reveal intricate details of visual pathways, offering new insights into the functional organization of the human brain."}
