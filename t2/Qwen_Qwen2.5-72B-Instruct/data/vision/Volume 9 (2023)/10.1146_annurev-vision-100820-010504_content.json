{"Abstract": "This review highlights the ophthalmic manifestations and pathogenic mechanisms of emerging viral infections, focusing on COVID-19 and Ebola virus disease. These viruses can cause a range of ocular complications, including uveitis, conjunctivitis, and retinal disorders, which may persist even after systemic recovery. The review discusses the current understanding of viral persistence in ocular tissues and the implications for long-term patient management. Emphasis is placed on the importance of early diagnosis and interdisciplinary collaboration to mitigate the impact of these emerging infectious diseases on ocular health."}
