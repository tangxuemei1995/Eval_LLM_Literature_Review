{"Abstract": "This study investigates the role of the basal ganglia, specifically the striatum and pallidum, in visual perceptual decisions. Using a combination of behavioral tasks and neurophysiological recordings, we examined how these structures contribute to saccadic choices and reaction times. Our findings suggest that the basal ganglia are involved in the sequential analysis of visual signals, facilitating the accumulation of sensory evidence and the thresholding process that underlies decision-making. Signal detection theory was applied to model the decision process, revealing that the basal ganglia modulate the balance between speed and accuracy in perceptual decisions. These results provide insights into the neural mechanisms that support visual perception and decision-making."}
