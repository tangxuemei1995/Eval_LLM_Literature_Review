{"Abstract": "This study explores the dual principles of efficient coding and predictive coding in the visual system, highlighting their complementary roles in neural information processing. Using the information bottleneck method, we analyze how the visual cortex optimizes the trade-off between the amount of information retained about the visual input and the computational resources required. Our findings reveal that efficient coding mechanisms, which compress sensory data to reduce redundancy, work in tandem with predictive coding, which anticipates future inputs based on past experiences. This synergy enhances the system's ability to process complex visual scenes with high accuracy and low energy consumption. The results provide insights into the fundamental principles governing neural coding and offer implications for the design of more efficient artificial visual systems."}
