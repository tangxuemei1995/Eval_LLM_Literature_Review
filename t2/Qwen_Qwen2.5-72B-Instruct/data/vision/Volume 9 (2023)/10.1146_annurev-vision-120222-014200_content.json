{"Abstract": "This study investigates the interplay between perception and memory in the ventral visual stream and the medial temporal lobe, focusing on the perirhinal cortex. Using a combination of neuroimaging and behavioral experiments, we explore how these regions contribute to the encoding and retrieval of visual information. Results indicate that the perirhinal cortex plays a critical role in the transition from perceptual processing to memory formation, facilitating the integration of visual features into coherent object representations. Furthermore, the ventral visual stream is shown to be involved in the initial stages of visual processing, while the medial temporal lobe, particularly the perirhinal cortex, is essential for the consolidation of these perceptions into long-term memory. These findings enhance our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying visual perception and memory, highlighting the importance of the perirhinal cortex in bridging these cognitive processes."}
