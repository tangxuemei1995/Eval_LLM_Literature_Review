{"Abstract": "Nonvisual opsins, a diverse group of photosensitive proteins, have emerged as key players in extraocular light sensing, extending beyond the classical role of visual opsins in the retina. These opsins, including melanopsin and neuropsin, are expressed in various tissues outside the eye, such as the skin, brain, and peripheral organs, where they mediate a range of physiological responses to light. Recent studies have highlighted their involvement in regulating the circadian clock, influencing sleep-wake cycles, and modulating metabolic processes. For instance, melanopsin in the suprachiasmatic nucleus helps synchronize the circadian rhythm with environmental light cues, while opsins in the skin may contribute to the regulation of circadian gene expression and skin homeostasis. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the expanding roles of nonvisual opsins in extraocular light sensing, emphasizing their significance in maintaining physiological balance and health."}
