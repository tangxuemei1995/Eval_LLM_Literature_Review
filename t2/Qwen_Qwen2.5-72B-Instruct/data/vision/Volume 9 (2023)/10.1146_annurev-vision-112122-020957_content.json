{"Abstract": "Photoreceptor degenerative disorders, such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration, are leading causes of irreversible blindness. These conditions are characterized by the progressive loss of photoreceptors, leading to retinal remodeling and synaptic plasticity, which exacerbate vision loss. This review summarizes recent advances in understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying retinal remodeling and highlights potential therapeutic strategies to suppress this process. By targeting specific signaling pathways and modulating synaptic plasticity, it may be possible to preserve retinal structure and function, thereby mitigating vision loss. Preclinical studies in animal models have shown promising results, suggesting that interventions aimed at suppressing retinal remodeling could offer a novel approach to treating these debilitating disorders."}
