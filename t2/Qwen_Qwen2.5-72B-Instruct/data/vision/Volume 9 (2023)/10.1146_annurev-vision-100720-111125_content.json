{"Abstract": "The development of the vertebrate eye is a complex and highly orchestrated process involving the formation of the optic cup, retina, lens, and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). During early embryogenesis, the optic vesicle invaginates to form the optic cup, which gives rise to the neural retina and the RPE. The lens placode, derived from surface ectoderm, invaginates to form the lens vesicle, which subsequently differentiates into the lens. Interactions between the optic cup and the lens vesicle are crucial for the proper development of both structures. The RPE plays a vital role in maintaining the health and function of the retina by regulating the transport of nutrients and waste products. Disruptions in these developmental processes can lead to various ocular malformations and diseases. Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying eye morphogenesis is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to treat congenital and acquired eye disorders."}
