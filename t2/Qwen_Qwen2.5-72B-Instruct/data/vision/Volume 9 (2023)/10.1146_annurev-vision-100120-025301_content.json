{"Abstract": "This study explores the neural mechanisms underlying visual object representations through advanced decoding techniques. Utilizing multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), we investigated the representational structure of visual stimuli in the human brain, focusing on how internal representations of objects are encoded and dynamically processed. Our findings reveal that distinct neural patterns correspond to different object categories, suggesting a rich and structured representation of visual information. Furthermore, the temporal dynamics of these patterns provide insights into the stages of object processing, from initial perception to higher-level cognitive interpretation. These results contribute to our understanding of how the brain constructs and manipulates visual representations, highlighting the potential of neural decoding in elucidating the complexities of visual cognition."}
