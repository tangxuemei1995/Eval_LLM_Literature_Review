{"Abstract": "Retinal degeneration, characterized by the progressive loss of photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), poses significant challenges for vision restoration. This review examines the factors influencing stem cellâ€“based regenerative approaches, focusing on the use of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to regenerate RPE and photoreceptors. The immune microenvironment, critical for the survival and integration of transplanted cells, is discussed, highlighting the role of immune modulation in enhancing therapeutic outcomes. Additionally, the differentiation efficiency of PSCs into functional retinal cells and the optimization of delivery methods are explored. Recent studies indicate that the success of these therapies is contingent upon a balanced immune response and the precise targeting of cell replacement. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the current state of stem cell therapy for retinal degeneration and identifies key areas for future research."}
