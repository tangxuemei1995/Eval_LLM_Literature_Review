{"Abstract": "The preferred retinal locus (PRL) is a critical concept in understanding visual adaptation in individuals with central vision loss, such as those with macular degeneration. The PRL refers to a specific area outside the fovea that patients use for fixation and visual tasks. This study explores the characteristics of the PRL, its role in fixation stability, and the differences in PRL selection between monocular and binocular viewing. Findings indicate that the PRL is highly variable among individuals and is influenced by the extent and location of central vision loss, emphasizing the importance of personalized rehabilitation strategies to enhance visual function."}
