{"Abstract": "This study investigates the impact of mobile applications as assistive devices for individuals with vision impairments, focusing on their role in enhancing daily living and accessibility. A comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical data from user surveys and app usage analytics was conducted. The findings indicate that mobile apps designed with accessibility features significantly improve the independence and quality of life for visually impaired users. These apps facilitate a range of activities, including navigation, reading, and communication, by leveraging advanced technologies such as text-to-speech, object recognition, and GPS. However, the study also highlights several challenges, such as the need for more intuitive user interfaces, better integration with existing assistive technologies, and increased awareness among the visually impaired community. Additionally, the research underscores the importance of ongoing user feedback and iterative design processes to ensure that apps remain effective and user-friendly. The implications of this study suggest that mobile apps have the potential to play a crucial role in vision rehabilitation and should be integrated into comprehensive care plans for individuals with vision impairments."}
