{"Abstract": "This study investigates the neuronal mechanisms underlying three-dimensional (3D) vision in nonhuman primates, focusing on the neural representations of depth, orientation, and motion. Using a combination of behavioral tasks and neurophysiological recordings, we identified specific neuronal populations in the visual cortex that are sensitive to stereoscopic cues and perspective. Our findings reveal that neurons in the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas exhibit selective responses to 3D motion and orientation, suggesting a critical role in the perception of depth. Additionally, we observed that these neurons integrate information from both eyes to construct a coherent 3D representation of the visual scene. The results provide insights into the neural basis of 3D vision and highlight the importance of binocular integration and motion processing in the primate visual system."}
