{"Abstract": "This study investigates the role of the cerebral cortex in visual search using natural scenes in rhesus monkeys. By recording neural activity in the visual cortex and frontal eye field during saccadic eye movements, we aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the processing of complex visual information. Our findings suggest that the cerebral cortex integrates multiple visual features to guide attention and facilitate efficient search, highlighting the importance of naturalistic stimuli in understanding neural processing."}
