{"Abstract": "Diabetes-induced visual dysfunction is a significant complication affecting the retina, a complex neural tissue critical for vision. This study investigates the physiological changes in retinal neurons of both human and rodent models, including mice and rats, with diabetes. Utilizing advanced imaging and electrophysiological techniques, we observed alterations in rod and cone photoreceptors, as well as in bipolar and ganglion cells, which are key components of the retinal circuitry. These changes include reduced photoreceptor sensitivity, disrupted synaptic transmission, and increased oxidative stress, leading to impaired visual processing. Our findings highlight the multifaceted nature of diabetic retinopathy and provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for mitigating visual dysfunction in diabetic patients."}
