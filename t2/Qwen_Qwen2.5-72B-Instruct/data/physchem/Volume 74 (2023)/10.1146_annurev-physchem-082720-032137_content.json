{"Abstract": "This study investigates the photodarkening and photobrightening phenomena in lanthanide-doped upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs), focusing on the role of color centers in these processes. Color centers, formed by ion vacancies or impurities, can significantly influence the optical properties of UCNPs, leading to reversible photoswitching and photon avalanching. The research explores how these effects can be harnessed for advanced applications, including X-ray detection and optical patterning. By understanding the mechanisms of color center formation and their impact on UCNP performance, this work aims to optimize the design of UCNPs for emerging technologies, enhancing their sensitivity and stability in practical devices."}
