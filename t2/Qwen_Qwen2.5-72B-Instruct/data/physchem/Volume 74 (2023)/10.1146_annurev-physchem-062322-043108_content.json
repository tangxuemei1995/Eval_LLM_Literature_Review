{"Abstract": "This study investigates the magneto-optical properties of noble metal nanostructures, focusing on plasmon-mediated magneto-optics. Noble metal nanostructures, including superatoms, exhibit unique optical and magnetic behaviors due to their size and shape-dependent plasmonic resonances. We explore the spin-polarized emission and magnetic circular photoluminescence (MCPL) in these systems, which are crucial for developing advanced optical devices and sensors. The research employs a combination of experimental techniques and theoretical modeling to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and MCPL. Our findings reveal that the magnetic field can significantly modulate the optical properties of noble metal nanostructures, opening new avenues for the design of magneto-optical materials with tailored functionalities."}
