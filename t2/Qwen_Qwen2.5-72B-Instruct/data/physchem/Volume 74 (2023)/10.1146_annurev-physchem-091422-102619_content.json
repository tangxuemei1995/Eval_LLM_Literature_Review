{"Abstract": "The dynamics of photoacid behavior within the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) were investigated using ultrafast spectroscopy techniques, including stimulated Raman spectroscopy. The study reveals the coherent coupling between the chromophore's excited states and the proton transfer processes, which are crucial for GFP's fluorescence properties. Proton tunneling events were observed on a femtosecond timescale, indicating a rapid response to the initial photoexcitation. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the efficient energy transfer and fluorescence emission in GFP, highlighting the role of environmental coherence in modulating the protein's photophysical properties."}
