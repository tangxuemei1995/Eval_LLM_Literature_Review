{"Abstract": "Photochemical upconversion, a process that converts low-energy photons into higher-energy ones, is driven by tripletâ€“triplet annihilation (TTA) and is influenced by the spin statistical limit and magnetic field effects. This study investigates the kinetics and upconversion quantum yield of a sensitizer-chromophore pair, revealing that the efficiency of the upconversion process can be significantly enhanced by optimizing the concentration and interaction dynamics of the sensitizer and chromophore. The results highlight the importance of these parameters in achieving high upconversion efficiencies, which are crucial for applications in solar energy conversion and bioimaging."}
