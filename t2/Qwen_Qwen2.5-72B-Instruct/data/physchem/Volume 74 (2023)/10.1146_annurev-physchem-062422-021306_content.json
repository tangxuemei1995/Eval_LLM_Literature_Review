{"Abstract": "This study investigates the anharmonic effects on the vibrational spectra of high-frequency modes in molecular systems. By employing advanced computational methods, we analyze the extent of mode mixing and resonances that arise due to anharmonic interactions. Our results demonstrate significant deviations from harmonic approximations, particularly in the high-frequency regime, where anharmonic couplings lead to pronounced mode mixing and spectral shifts. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of improving the accuracy of vibrational spectroscopy predictions and the interpretation of experimental data. The study highlights the importance of incorporating anharmonic corrections in theoretical models to achieve a more precise understanding of molecular vibrations."}
