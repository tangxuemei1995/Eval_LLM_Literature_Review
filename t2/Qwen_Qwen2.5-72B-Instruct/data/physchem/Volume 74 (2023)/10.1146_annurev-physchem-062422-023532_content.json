{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate many-body effects in aqueous systems, emphasizing the synergistic relationship between advanced interaction analysis techniques and the development of polarizable force fields. By employing a many-body expansion approach, we dissect the contributions of various intermolecular interactions, including electrostatic, van der Waals, and hydrogen bonding, to the overall stability and dynamics of water. Molecular dynamics simulations, coupled with state-of-the-art polarizable force fields, reveal the importance of higher-order many-body terms in accurately capturing the collective behavior of water molecules. Our findings highlight the necessity of incorporating these effects in force field models to enhance the predictive power of simulations, particularly in complex biological and environmental contexts. The integration of these methodologies not only advances our fundamental understanding of aqueous systems but also provides a robust framework for the design of more accurate and reliable force fields."}
