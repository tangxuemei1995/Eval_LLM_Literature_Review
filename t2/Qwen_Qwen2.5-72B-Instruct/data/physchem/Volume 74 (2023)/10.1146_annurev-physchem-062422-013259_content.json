{"Abstract": "Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a cornerstone in computational chemistry and materials science, offering a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. This study explores the predictive power of DFT by focusing on the role of exact constraints and appropriate norms in the construction of density functionals. We demonstrate that adherence to exact constraints, such as the uniform electron gas limit and the strong-interaction limit, significantly enhances the accuracy of exchange-correlation energy predictions. Furthermore, the use of appropriate norms, such as the Kullback-Leibler divergence, ensures that the functionals are well-behaved and physically meaningful. Our results show that functionals satisfying these criteria outperform conventional functionals in predicting electronic structures across a diverse set of systems, including molecules, solids, and surfaces. This work underscores the importance of theoretical rigor in the development of density functionals and provides a robust framework for future advancements in DFT."}
