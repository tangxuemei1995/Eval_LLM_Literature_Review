{"Abstract": "This study investigates the excited-state dynamics of molecular organic aggregates, which are crucial for the development of advanced optoelectronic devices. By employing a combination of computational methods and theoretical models, we explore the radiative and nonradiative decay pathways in these aggregates. Our focus is on understanding the role of conical intersections and the interplay between singlet fission and triplet-triplet annihilation processes. We develop and validate exciton models that accurately describe the energy transfer and relaxation mechanisms within the aggregates. The results provide insights into the design principles for optimizing the performance of organic photovoltaics and light-emitting diodes, highlighting the importance of controlling the excited-state dynamics at the molecular level."}
