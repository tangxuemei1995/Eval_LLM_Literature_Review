{"Abstract": "This study presents an advanced in situ spectroscopic technique for monitoring the evolving excited-state dynamics during the deposition and processing of organic thin films. Utilizing single-shot transient absorption spectroscopy, we capture real-time changes in the electronic structure and molecular aggregation of organic materials as they undergo thermal annealing. The instrument design allows for precise control over the deposition conditions and annealing processes, enabling a detailed investigation of the dynamic behavior of excited states. Our results reveal significant shifts in the absorption spectra, indicative of changes in molecular packing and intermolecular interactions. This approach provides valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing the performance of organic electronic devices, offering a powerful tool for optimizing material properties and device fabrication processes."}
