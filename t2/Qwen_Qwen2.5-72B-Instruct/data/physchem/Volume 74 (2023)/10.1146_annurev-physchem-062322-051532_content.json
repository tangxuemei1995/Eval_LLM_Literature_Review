{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy, facilitated by free-electron lasers, to investigate elementary molecular events at conical intersections. Conical intersections play a crucial role in photochemical processes, governing the non-adiabatic dynamics that dictate the fate of excited molecules. By employing time-resolved X-ray techniques, we capture the transient structural changes and electronic rearrangements that occur on femtosecond timescales. Our findings reveal the intricate dynamics at these intersections, providing insights into the mechanisms of photoinduced reactions. This research advances the understanding of fundamental photochemical processes and paves the way for the development of new materials and technologies in areas such as solar energy conversion and photocatalysis."}
