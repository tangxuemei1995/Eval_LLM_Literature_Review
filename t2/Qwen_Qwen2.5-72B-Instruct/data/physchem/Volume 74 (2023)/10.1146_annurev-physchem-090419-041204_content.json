{"Abstract": "This study employs site-specific exciton-coupled dimer probe spectroscopy to investigate local DNA backbone conformation and conformational disorder. By integrating advanced 2D spectroscopy techniques and site-specific fluorescence labeling, we elucidate the dynamic structural changes in DNA, particularly during processes such as DNA replication and proteinâ€“DNA interactions. The exciton-coupled dimers serve as sensitive probes, allowing us to monitor subtle conformational changes and transient states, including DNA breathing. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying DNA function and stability, highlighting the role of local conformational dynamics in biological processes."}
