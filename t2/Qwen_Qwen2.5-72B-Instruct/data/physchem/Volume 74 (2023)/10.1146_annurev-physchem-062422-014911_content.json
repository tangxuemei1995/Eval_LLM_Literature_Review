{"Abstract": "This study investigates the mechanisms of photothermalization in plasmonic nanostructures, focusing on the steady-state behavior of metallic nanoparticles. Using Raman thermometry, we quantify the temperature distribution and the dynamics of nonthermal carriers, including hot electrons, generated upon light excitation. Our findings reveal that the steady-state regime is characterized by a rapid thermalization process, where hot electrons transfer energy to the lattice, leading to a significant temperature rise. This process is crucial for applications in photocatalysis, where the localized heat can enhance reaction rates. The results provide insights into optimizing the design of plasmonic nanostructures for efficient energy conversion and catalytic processes."}
