{"Abstract": "This study investigates the formation of stable glasses through surface-mediated equilibration, utilizing physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques. By depositing materials onto substrates under controlled conditions, we observe enhanced surface mobility that facilitates the relaxation of structural anisotropies, leading to glasses with improved stability. The glass transition temperature is significantly elevated, indicating a reduction in the thermodynamic distance from the equilibrium liquid state. Our findings highlight the critical role of surface dynamics in the formation of stable glasses, offering new insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing glass formation and potential applications in advanced materials design."}
