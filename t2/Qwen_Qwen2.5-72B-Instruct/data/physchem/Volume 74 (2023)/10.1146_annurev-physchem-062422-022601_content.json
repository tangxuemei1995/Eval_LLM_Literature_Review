{"Abstract": "This study presents a novel approach to 3D super-resolution fluorescence imaging of microgels, utilizing advanced nanoscopy techniques to achieve unprecedented spatial resolution. Microgels, dynamic and adaptive polymer networks, were labeled with specific fluorescent markers to enable detailed visualization of their internal structure and dynamics. The imaging protocol, combining stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy with adaptive optics, allowed for the reconstruction of 3D models with sub-diffraction limit resolution, revealing the intricate polymer network architecture and the distribution of functional components within the microgels. Correlative microscopy techniques were employed to validate the structural information obtained from super-resolution images, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the data. This method provides a powerful tool for the study of microgel behavior in adaptive materials, offering insights into their mechanical properties and potential applications in drug delivery and tissue engineering."}
