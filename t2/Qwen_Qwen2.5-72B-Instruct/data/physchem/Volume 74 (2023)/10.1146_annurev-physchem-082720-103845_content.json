{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of computational spectroscopy to elucidate the gas-phase rotational and vibrational spectra of the molecular bricks of life, including amino acids and nucleobases. The inherent flexibility and anharmonicity of these molecules pose significant challenges for accurate spectral prediction. We employ advanced quantum chemical methods and anharmonic force fields to simulate their spectra, comparing the results with experimental data. The findings highlight the importance of considering anharmonic effects to achieve precise spectral assignments, which are crucial for understanding the fundamental properties and interactions of these essential biomolecules. This work advances the field of computational spectroscopy, providing a robust framework for the analysis of complex molecular systems in the gas phase."}
