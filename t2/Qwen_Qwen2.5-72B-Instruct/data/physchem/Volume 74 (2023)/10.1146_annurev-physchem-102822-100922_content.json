{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate interplay between excitation-induced dephasing and many-body effects in the context of exciton scattering, utilizing advanced coherent nonlinear spectroscopy techniques. By applying quantum stochastic calculus, we analyze the optical signatures that emerge from stochastic processes in complex quantum systems. Our findings reveal that the dynamics of exciton scattering are significantly influenced by many-body interactions, leading to distinct spectral features that can be directly observed in nonlinear optical experiments. These results provide a deeper understanding of the underlying quantum dynamics and offer new insights into the control and manipulation of excitonic processes in advanced materials."}
