{"Abstract": "This study investigates the spectroscopic properties of clusters relevant to atmospheric aerosols, focusing on their role in new particle formation and their implications for climate. Utilizing advanced spectroscopic techniques, we characterized the size, composition, and reactivity of these clusters under varying atmospheric conditions. Our findings reveal that specific cluster compositions exhibit enhanced stability and reactivity, which are crucial for the initial stages of new particle formation. These results provide insights into the mechanisms governing aerosol formation and growth, contributing to a better understanding of their impact on cloud formation and radiative forcing. The data obtained can refine models predicting atmospheric aerosol behavior, thereby improving climate change projections."}
