{"Abstract": "This study explores the integration of machine learning, graphical processing units (GPUs), and cloud computing to enable interactive quantum chemistry simulations. By leveraging natural user interfaces and chemical structure recognition, the proposed framework facilitates real-time interaction with complex molecular systems. The use of GPUs accelerates computational tasks, while cloud computing provides scalable resources to handle large-scale simulations. Extended reality (XR) technologies enhance the user experience by providing immersive visualizations of molecular structures and reactions. This approach not only streamlines the workflow for chemists and materials scientists but also opens new avenues for educational and collaborative applications in the field of quantum chemistry."}
