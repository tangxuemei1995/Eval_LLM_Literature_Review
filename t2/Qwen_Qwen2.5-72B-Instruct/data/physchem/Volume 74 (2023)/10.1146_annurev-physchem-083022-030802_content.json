{"Abstract": "This study investigates the adsorption mechanisms at nanoconfined solidâ€“water interfaces, focusing on the role of nanopores and surface complexation in influencing the speciation of adsorbed species. Using a combination of experimental techniques and computational modeling, we explore how nanoconfinement alters the adsorption behavior of various ions and molecules. Results indicate that the unique properties of nanopores, such as reduced dimensionality and enhanced surface-to-volume ratio, significantly affect the adsorption kinetics and equilibrium. Surface complexation models were employed to elucidate the speciation of adsorbed species, revealing the formation of distinct complexes under nanoconfined conditions. These findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental processes governing adsorption in confined environments, with implications for applications in water purification, catalysis, and environmental remediation."}
