{"Abstract": "The discovery of novel chemical reactions is a cornerstone of advancing organic synthesis, yet it remains a challenging task due to the vastness of potential reaction pathways. This study employs the Artificial Force Induced Reaction (AFIR) method to systematically explore the potential energy surface (PES) and identify new reaction pathways. By integrating quantum chemical calculations with AFIR, we construct a comprehensive reaction path network that elucidates the energetics and dynamics of complex organic reactions. The method is validated through kinetic simulations, which accurately predict the outcomes of several benchmark reactions. Our approach not only accelerates the discovery of new reactions but also provides mechanistic insights that can guide the design of more efficient synthetic routes. This work represents a significant step toward automating the discovery of chemical reactions, leveraging the power of computational chemistry to expand the frontiers of organic synthesis."}
