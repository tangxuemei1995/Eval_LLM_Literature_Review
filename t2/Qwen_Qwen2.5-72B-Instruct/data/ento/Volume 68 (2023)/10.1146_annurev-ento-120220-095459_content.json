{"Abstract": "Vibrational signaling, a critical component of biotremology, plays a pivotal role in the communication and behavior of numerous insect species. This review explores the functional diversity of substrate-borne communication systems, highlighting the evolutionary adaptations and signaling contexts that underpin these interactions. We examine the role of vibrosensory evolution in shaping the complexity of vibrational signals and their integration with other sensory modalities, such as chemical and auditory cues. The implications of this multimodal signaling for pest management are also discussed, emphasizing the potential for developing novel control strategies that exploit the unique aspects of insect vibrational communication. This comprehensive analysis underscores the importance of understanding the intricate signaling systems in insects for both ecological and applied contexts."}
