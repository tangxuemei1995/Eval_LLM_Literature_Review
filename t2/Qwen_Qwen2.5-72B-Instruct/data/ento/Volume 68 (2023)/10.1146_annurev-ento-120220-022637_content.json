{"Abstract": "This study explores the diversity, form, and postembryonic development of Paleozoic insects, focusing on the early evolution of Hexapoda. Through a comprehensive review of fossil records and comparative analysis of functional morphology, we identify key deep divergences that shaped the evolutionary trajectory of Insecta. Our findings reveal a remarkable diversity of forms, including early representatives of winged and wingless lineages, and provide insights into the origins of metamorphosis. The analysis of postembryonic developmental stages highlights the significance of ecological pressures in driving the diversification of insect body plans. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the evolutionary history of insects and their adaptive radiation during the Paleozoic era."}
