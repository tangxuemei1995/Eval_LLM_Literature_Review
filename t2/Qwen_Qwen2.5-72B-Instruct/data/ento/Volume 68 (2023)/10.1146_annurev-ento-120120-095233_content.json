{"Abstract": "Winter survival in organisms is a complex process involving a suite of molecular mechanisms that enhance cold tolerance and stress resistance. This review synthesizes recent advances in understanding the molecular underpinnings of diapause and acclimation, focusing on the regulation of gene expression, metabolic reprogramming, and cellular protection strategies. Key findings highlight the role of specific transcription factors and signaling pathways that modulate the expression of cold-responsive genes, such as those involved in antifreeze protein synthesis, membrane fluidity, and osmolyte accumulation. Additionally, the energetics of winter survival are explored, with an emphasis on the metabolic shifts towards anaerobic pathways and the mobilization of energy reserves. These adaptations collectively enable organisms to endure prolonged periods of cold exposure and emerge successfully in the spring. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for predicting the impacts of climate change on species survival and for developing strategies to enhance cold tolerance in agricultural and biomedical contexts."}
