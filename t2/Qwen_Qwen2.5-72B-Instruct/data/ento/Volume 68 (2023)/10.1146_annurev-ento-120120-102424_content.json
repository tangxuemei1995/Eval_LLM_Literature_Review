{"Abstract": "This study investigates the resilience of plant–pollinator networks in the face of global environmental change, focusing on the robustness of mutualistic interactions that underpin ecosystem function. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of plant–pollinator interactions across diverse ecosystems, we assess the impact of environmental stressors such as climate change, habitat loss, and invasive species on network structure and stability. Our findings reveal that while some networks exhibit high robustness, characterized by the presence of key generalist species that buffer against perturbations, others are more vulnerable due to specialized interactions and lower connectivity. We also identify critical thresholds beyond which ecosystem shifts may occur, leading to potential collapse of pollination services. The implications of these results highlight the importance of conserving and restoring plant–pollinator networks to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem resilience in a changing world."}
