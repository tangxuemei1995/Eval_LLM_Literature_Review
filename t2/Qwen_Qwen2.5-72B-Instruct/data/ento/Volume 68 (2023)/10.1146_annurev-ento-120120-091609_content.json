{"Abstract": "This study explores the complex dynamics of dehydration in terrestrial arthropods, focusing on the physiological and behavioral mechanisms that enable these organisms to maintain water balance under varying environmental conditions. By integrating data from humidity sensing to trophic interactions, we provide insights into how arthropods adapt to drought and other climate change-induced stressors. Our findings highlight the critical role of sensory systems in detecting environmental humidity and the subsequent behavioral responses that optimize water retention. Additionally, we examine the cascading effects of dehydration on arthropod communities, including changes in predation and competition dynamics. This research underscores the importance of understanding arthropod water balance for predicting ecological responses to climate change."}
