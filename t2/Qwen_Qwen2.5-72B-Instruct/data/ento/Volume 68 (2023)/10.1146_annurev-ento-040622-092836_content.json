{"Abstract": "Iron homeostasis is crucial for the survival and development of insects, as it plays a vital role in various physiological processes, including oxygen transport, energy metabolism, and immune responses. This review highlights the mechanisms governing iron uptake, storage, and utilization in insects, with a focus on the roles of heme, ferritin, and transferrin. Recent studies have elucidated the function of metal transporters in facilitating iron absorption and distribution across different tissues. The regulation of these transporters in response to iron availability and environmental stressors is also discussed, emphasizing the adaptive strategies insects employ to maintain iron homeostasis. Understanding these mechanisms provides insights into the evolutionary adaptations of insects and may offer new targets for pest control and disease management."}
