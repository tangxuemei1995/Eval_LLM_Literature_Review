{"Abstract": "Spodoptera frugiperda, commonly known as the fall armyworm, is a significant agricultural pest with a complex ecology and evolutionary history. This review synthesizes current knowledge on its taxonomy, population genetics, host plant use, strain hybridization, mate attraction, and insecticide resistance. Genetic studies reveal distinct lineages and hybridization events that influence its adaptability and spread. Host plant use varies widely, impacting crop selection and management strategies. Mate attraction mechanisms, including pheromone communication, are crucial for understanding population dynamics and developing control methods. Insecticide resistance has emerged as a critical challenge, necessitating integrated pest management approaches that combine biological, chemical, and cultural practices. This comprehensive overview highlights the need for continued research to address the ecological and evolutionary complexities of S. frugiperda and to develop sustainable management options."}
