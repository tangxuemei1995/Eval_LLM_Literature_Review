{"Abstract": "This study explores the chemical ecology of floral resources in the context of conservation biological control, focusing on the interactions between parasitoids, hyperparasitoids, and their environment in agroecosystems. Floral volatiles play a crucial role in attracting parasitoids to their hosts, while nectar and nectar-associated microorganisms serve as essential food sources that enhance parasitoid fitness and longevity. We conducted field and laboratory experiments to investigate how specific floral volatiles influence parasitoid foraging behavior and how nectar-associated microorganisms affect parasitoid performance. Our results indicate that certain floral volatiles significantly increase parasitoid attraction, while the presence of beneficial microorganisms in nectar can improve parasitoid survival and reproductive success. These findings highlight the importance of floral resource management in enhancing the effectiveness of parasitoids for pest control and suggest strategies for optimizing agroecosystems to support beneficial insects."}
