{"Abstract": "Bed bugs, primarily Cimex lectularius and Cimex hemipterus, have experienced a global resurgence, necessitating a comprehensive review of historical and contemporary control options. This study synthesizes data from a wide range of sources, including historical texts and recent scientific literature, to evaluate the efficacy of both chemical and nonchemical management strategies. Chemical control methods, such as pyrethroids and neonicotinoids, have been widely used but are increasingly met with resistance. Nonchemical approaches, including heat treatment, mechanical traps, and biological control agents, offer promising alternatives. The integration of these methods into a robust integrated pest management (IPM) framework is essential for sustainable control. This review highlights the importance of combining multiple strategies to address the complex challenges posed by bed bug infestations, emphasizing the need for ongoing research and adaptive management practices."}
