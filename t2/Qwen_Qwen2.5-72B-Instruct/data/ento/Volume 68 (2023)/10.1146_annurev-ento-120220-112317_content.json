{"Abstract": "The silkworm, Bombyx mori, is a significant insect in sericulture, but its productivity is often compromised by infections from the Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV). Understanding the mechanisms of silkworm resistance to BmNPV is crucial for developing antiviral breeding strategies. This study investigates the genetic and molecular bases of silkworm resistance to BmNPV through comprehensive genetic analysis and gene location studies. We identified several candidate resistant genes that play key roles in the virusâ€“host interaction, including those involved in the immune response, apoptosis, and cellular signaling pathways. Through linkage mapping and genome-wide association studies, we localized these genes to specific chromosomal regions, providing a foundation for marker-assisted selection in breeding programs. Additionally, functional assays revealed that certain resistant genes enhance the silkworm's ability to recognize and neutralize BmNPV, thereby reducing viral replication and spread. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between the silkworm and BmNPV, and offer valuable insights for the development of more resilient silkworm strains through targeted genetic modification and traditional breeding techniques."}
