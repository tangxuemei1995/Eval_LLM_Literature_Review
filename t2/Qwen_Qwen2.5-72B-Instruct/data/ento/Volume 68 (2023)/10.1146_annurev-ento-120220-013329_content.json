{"Abstract": "Phoresy, a form of symbiotic relationship where one organism (the phoront) attaches to another (the carrier) for transport, is a widespread phenomenon among mites (Acari). This study explores the complex dynamics of phoretic relationships, revealing that these interactions are not merely passive dispersal mechanisms but can involve conditional relationships that shift between mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and new empirical data, we demonstrate that the nature of these relationships is influenced by environmental factors, host availability, and the life history traits of both the phoront and the carrier. Our findings highlight the importance of phoresy in the dispersal and survival of mites, and suggest that these interactions play a crucial role in shaping host relationships and ecosystem dynamics. This research provides a deeper understanding of the adaptive significance of phoresy and its implications for the study of symbiosis and parasitism."}
