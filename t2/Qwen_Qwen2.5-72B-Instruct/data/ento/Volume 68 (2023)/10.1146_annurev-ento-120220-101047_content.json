{"Abstract": "Diapause, a period of arrested development and reduced metabolic activity, is a critical adaptive strategy in univoltine and semivoltine life cycles, enabling organisms to survive unfavorable environmental conditions. This study explores the mechanisms and ecological implications of diapause in these life cycles, focusing on the roles of bet-hedging, circannual rhythms, and phenotypic plasticity. Using a combination of field observations and laboratory experiments, we investigated how climate warming affects the timing and duration of diapause in various insect species. Our results indicate that prolonged diapause is increasingly observed as a response to unpredictable environmental cues, suggesting a shift in the evolutionary strategy from fixed to more flexible diapause induction. This phenotypic plasticity in diapause timing is crucial for seasonal adaptation, allowing species to optimize their life cycle in response to changing climatic conditions. The findings highlight the importance of understanding diapause regulation in the context of global environmental changes, as it can have significant implications for population dynamics and ecosystem stability."}
