{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of remote sensing technologies, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellite imagery, for the early detection of wood-boring pests in forest ecosystems. By analyzing spectral signatures and canopy changes, the research aims to develop a robust monitoring system capable of identifying pest infestations at their onset. The integration of high-resolution imagery and machine learning algorithms enhances the accuracy and efficiency of pest detection, providing forest managers with critical information for timely intervention. Field validation confirms the potential of this approach in improving forest health management."}
