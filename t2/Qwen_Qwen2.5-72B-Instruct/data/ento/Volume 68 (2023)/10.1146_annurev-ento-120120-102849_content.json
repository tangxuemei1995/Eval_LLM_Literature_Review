{"Abstract": "This study investigates the origins and evolution of herbivory on land by examining arthropod and pathogen damage on both fossil and modern plants. We analyze damage types and functional feeding groups across different geological periods, including the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) and Permian–Triassic (P–Tr) ecologic crises, as well as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). Our continental-scale analysis reveals that the diversity and complexity of herbivory have increased over time, with significant shifts in damage types coinciding with major ecological disruptions. During the K–Pg event, we observe a reduction in the diversity of damage types, suggesting a temporary decline in herbivore diversity and plant-herbivore interactions. In contrast, the PETM is characterized by an increase in damage diversity, indicating a rapid expansion of herbivory in response to environmental changes. The P–Tr crisis, one of the most severe mass extinctions, led to a prolonged period of reduced herbivory, followed by a gradual recovery and diversification. These findings provide insights into the resilience and adaptability of plant-herbivore systems in the face of global environmental changes, highlighting the importance of long-term ecological studies in understanding the dynamics of herbivory over geological time scales."}
