{"Abstract": "The deployment of Bt crops, genetically engineered to produce insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis, has revolutionized pest management in the United States, particularly for key pests in corn and cotton. These crops have shown significant efficacy against Lepidoptera and Coleoptera, reducing the reliance on chemical insecticides. However, the evolution of resistance in target pests poses a critical challenge to the sustainability of Bt technology. Insect resistance management (IRM) strategies, such as the high-dose/refuge approach, have been implemented to delay resistance development. This strategy involves planting a portion of the field with non-Bt crops (refuge) to ensure the survival of susceptible insects, which can then mate with any resistant individuals. Despite these efforts, resistance has been documented in some pest populations, necessitating ongoing monitoring and adaptive management practices. This review examines the current status of Bt crop adoption, the effectiveness of IRM strategies, and the implications for future pest management in the United States."}
