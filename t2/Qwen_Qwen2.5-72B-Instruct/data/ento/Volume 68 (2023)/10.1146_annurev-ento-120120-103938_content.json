{"Abstract": "Stingless bees (Apidae: Apinae: Meliponini) are essential pollinators and honey producers in tropical and subtropical regions. This study explores their ecological roles, focusing on their foraging behavior, nest architecture, and interactions with the environment. Stingless bees collect nectar, pollen, and resin, contributing to plant reproduction and ecosystem health. Their unique social structure and nest-building techniques provide insights into the evolution of eusociality. Bee-keeping practices for stingless bees are gaining attention due to their potential for sustainable honey production and pollination services. This review synthesizes current knowledge on stingless bee ecology, highlighting the importance of conserving these species and their habitats to maintain biodiversity and support agricultural productivity in the tropics."}
