{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intricate communication systems that exist between plants and insects, focusing on the chemical ecology that underpins these interactions. Through an analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and fatty acid–amino acid conjugates (FACs), we explore how these chemical signals mediate a range of behaviors, from attraction and defense to mutualism and parasitism. The research highlights the role of pheromones in insect communication and the ways in which plants can both emit and respond to these chemical cues. By examining the complex interplay between plant and insect signaling, we provide new insights into the mechanisms that govern these relationships, which are crucial for ecosystem function and biodiversity. The findings have implications for understanding the evolutionary dynamics of plant–insect interactions and offer potential applications in pest management and ecological restoration."}
