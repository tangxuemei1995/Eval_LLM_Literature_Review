{"Abstract": "This study investigates the postcopulatory behavior of tephritid flies, focusing on the roles of sperm and accessory gland peptides (AGPs) in modulating female remating and copulation. AGPs, transferred during mating, significantly influence female receptivity and egg-laying patterns. The research also explores the implications of these behaviors for the sterile insect technique (SIT), a key method in pest control. Findings indicate that AGPs can reduce female remating rates, enhancing the effectiveness of SIT by ensuring that wild females mate with sterile males. Additionally, the study reveals that the quantity and quality of sperm and AGPs affect the duration of female refractoriness, providing insights into optimizing SIT protocols. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the reproductive biology of tephritid flies and offer practical applications for integrated pest management strategies."}
