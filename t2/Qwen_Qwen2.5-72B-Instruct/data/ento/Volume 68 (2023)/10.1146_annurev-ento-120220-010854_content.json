{"Abstract": "This study examines the multifaceted challenges and strategies associated with forest insect biosecurity, focusing on the processes, patterns, predictions, and pitfalls of managing non-native species. Biological invasions by forest insects pose significant threats to ecosystem health, biodiversity, and economic stability. We review the primary pathways of introduction, including international trade and human-mediated transport, and discuss the effectiveness of current phytosanitary measures. The paper highlights the importance of early detection and rapid response through enhanced surveillance systems, which are critical for the potential eradication of invasive species. However, the complexity of predicting invasion success and the ecological impacts of non-native species remains a significant challenge. Case studies from various regions illustrate the successes and failures of biosecurity protocols, emphasizing the need for adaptive management and international cooperation. This comprehensive analysis provides a foundation for developing more robust and proactive strategies to mitigate the risks of forest insect invasions."}
