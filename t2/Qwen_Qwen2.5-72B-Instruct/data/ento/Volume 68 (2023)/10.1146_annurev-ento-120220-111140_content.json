{"Abstract": "The spotted lanternfly, Lycorma delicatula (Hemiptera: Fulgoridae), an invasive planthopper, poses significant threats to viticulture and other agricultural sectors in the United States. This review synthesizes current knowledge on its biology, host plant preferences, and invasion potential. The lanternfly's rapid spread and polyphagous nature, favoring over 70 plant species, including economically important crops, necessitate integrated management strategies. Key findings include the identification of critical life stages and environmental factors influencing population dynamics, as well as the efficacy of various control methods. This information is crucial for developing effective monitoring and management practices to mitigate the impact of this invasive species on agricultural and natural ecosystems."}
