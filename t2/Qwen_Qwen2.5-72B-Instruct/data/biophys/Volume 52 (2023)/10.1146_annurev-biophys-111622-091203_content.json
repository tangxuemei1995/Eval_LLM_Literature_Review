{"Abstract": "The expanded central dogma of molecular biology now encompasses the synthesis of genomes and the creation of orthogonal biosystems, which operate independently of natural biological processes. Advances in synthetic biology have enabled the design and construction of synthetic genetic systems, including the incorporation of unnatural base pairs and the use of XNA (xeno-nucleic acids) as alternative genetic polymers. These innovations not only challenge the traditional boundaries of life but also open new avenues for biotechnology, drug discovery, and the study of evolutionary biology. This review highlights recent progress in genome resynthesis, the development of orthogonal biosystems, and the potential applications of synthetic genetics, emphasizing the importance of orthogonality in ensuring the stability and functionality of these novel biological systems."}
