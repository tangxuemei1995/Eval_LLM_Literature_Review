{"Abstract": "This review intertwines personal reflections with a deep dive into the molecular mechanisms of hydrogen exchange (HX) in proteins, focusing on hemoglobin allostery, protein folding, and the dynamic functions of AAA+ proteins. By exploring these interconnected processes, we elucidate the intricate workings of protein machines, highlighting the critical role of HX in understanding their structural and functional dynamics."}
