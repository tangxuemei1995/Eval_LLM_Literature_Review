{"Abstract": "This review explores the application of graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) materials in the sensing of biomolecules, focusing on their unique properties such as high specific surface area (SSA) and tunable density of states (DOS). The integration of these materials into field effect transistors (FETs) and impedance-based sensors has enabled the development of highly sensitive and selective detection platforms. The influence of defects on the performance of these sensors is discussed, along with the importance of standardization in sensor fabrication and characterization. Impedance models are presented to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the interaction between 2D materials and biomolecules, providing a foundation for the optimization of sensor design. This work highlights the potential of graphene and 2D materials to revolutionize biomolecular sensing, with implications for diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and personalized medicine."}
