{"Abstract": "Rhodopsin, a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) essential for vision, undergoes a light-induced conformational change that activates transducin, a G protein. This study elucidates the structural and mechanistic details of rhodopsin activation, revealing the critical role of specific amino acid residues and the dynamic movements of helices. Using a combination of crystallography, mutagenesis, and computational modeling, we demonstrate how the isomerization of retinal triggers the rearrangement of the receptor’s cytoplasmic face, facilitating G protein coupling. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the activation mechanism of this prototypical GPCR, with implications for the broader family of receptors."}
