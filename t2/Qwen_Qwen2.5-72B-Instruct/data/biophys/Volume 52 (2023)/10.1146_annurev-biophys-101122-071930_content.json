{"Abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) play crucial roles in cellular processes, often through transient and dynamic interactions. This study employs single-molecule FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to investigate the interaction dynamics of IDPs, focusing on the kinetics and structural ensembles of disordered complexes. By combining smFRET with molecular simulations, we provide a detailed characterization of the binding mechanisms and conformational changes that occur upon interaction. Our results reveal the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of IDP complexes, highlighting the importance of transient interactions in their functional roles. The insights gained from this study enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying IDP-mediated cellular processes and offer a framework for the design of targeted therapies."}
