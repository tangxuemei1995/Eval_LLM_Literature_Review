{"Abstract": "Quantitative Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) is a powerful super-resolution nanoscopy technique that enables the precise localization and quantitative analysis of individual molecules within cells. This method surpasses the diffraction limit of conventional light microscopy, providing unprecedented spatial resolution and detailed insights into cellular structures and dynamics. By accurately measuring the number, distribution, and interactions of molecules, SMLM facilitates a deeper understanding of complex biological processes at the molecular level. This review highlights recent advancements in SMLM, focusing on its applications in quantitative cell biology, and discusses the challenges and future directions for improving quantitative accuracy and expanding its utility in biological research."}
