{"Abstract": "Cryo-electron tomography (CET) has emerged as a powerful technique for visualizing the molecular architecture of cells in their native state. This review highlights recent advances in CET that have enabled high-resolution, in situ structural biology, providing unprecedented insights into the organization and dynamics of cellular components. By integrating CET with quantitative cell biology and biophysical modeling, researchers can now elucidate the structural principles underlying complex cellular processes. These developments are paving the way for a more comprehensive understanding of cellular function and dysfunction, with implications for both basic science and translational research."}
