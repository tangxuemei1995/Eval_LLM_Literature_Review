{"Abstract": "The rational design of cooperative receptors, a critical aspect of synthetic biology and bioengineering, leverages principles of allosterism and population shift to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of biosensors. This study explores the integration of aptamers, which undergo binding-induced folding, to create receptors that exhibit cooperative binding behavior. Through computational modeling and experimental validation, we demonstrate that the strategic design of these receptors can significantly amplify signal transduction, making them highly effective in detecting low-concentration analytes. The findings contribute to the development of advanced biosensing platforms with applications in diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and biotechnology. The approach also highlights the potential for engineering synthetic allosteric systems that can be tailored for specific biological and therapeutic needs."}
