{"Abstract": "The ribosome, a complex molecular machine essential for protein synthesis, presents significant challenges for structural and functional studies due to its size and dynamic nature. This paper explores the integration of cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to elucidate the mechanisms of ribosomal function and the impact of antibiotics. Cryo-EM provides high-resolution structural snapshots, while MD simulations offer insights into the dynamic processes of translation. By combining these approaches, we can better understand the conformational changes and interactions that govern ribosomal activity and the binding modes of antibiotics, which is crucial for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Our findings highlight the synergistic power of computational and experimental techniques in advancing the field of structural biology."}
