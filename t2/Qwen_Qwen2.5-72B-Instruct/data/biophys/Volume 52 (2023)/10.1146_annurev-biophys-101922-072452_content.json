{"Abstract": "The ribosome, a complex molecular machine, plays a crucial role in the translation of mRNA into proteins. This process involves the precise decoding of mRNA sequences and the accurate incorporation of amino acids by tRNAs, facilitated by elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G. Recent studies have revealed that the ribosome can also recode mRNA sequences through mechanisms such as frameshifting and stop codon readthrough, which expand the coding capacity of the genome. These phenomena are regulated by specific mRNA structures and sequences, as well as by the kinetics of ribosomal movements. Understanding the molecular details of these processes is essential for elucidating the mechanisms of gene expression and for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting the ribosome."}
