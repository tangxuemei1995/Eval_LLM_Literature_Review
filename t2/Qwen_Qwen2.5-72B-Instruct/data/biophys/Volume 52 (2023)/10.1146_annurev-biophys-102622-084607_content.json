{"Abstract": "This review critically evaluates the methodologies employed in predicting the three-dimensional (3D) structures of proteins and protein complexes, focusing on the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) and Critical Assessment of Predicted Interactions (CAPRI) initiatives. These community-wide experiments have been pivotal in advancing the field by benchmarking and refining computational methods. Recent advancements, particularly the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, have significantly enhanced the accuracy and reliability of structure predictions. However, challenges remain, especially in predicting the structures of large, complex assemblies and in accurately modeling protein interactions. This paper discusses the current state of the art, highlights key successes and limitations, and outlines future directions for improving the predictive power of computational tools in structural biology. The implications of these advancements for understanding protein function and for applications in drug discovery and biotechnology are also considered."}
