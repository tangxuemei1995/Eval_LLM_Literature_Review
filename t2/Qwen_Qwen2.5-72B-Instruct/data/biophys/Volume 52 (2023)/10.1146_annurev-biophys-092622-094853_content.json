{"Abstract": "Mitochondria play a crucial role in cellular energy production and apoptosis, and their functions are regulated by various ion channels. This review focuses on the diverse mitochondrial ion channels, including calcium, potassium, chloride channels, and the mitochondrial megachannel. Calcium channels, such as the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, are essential for calcium homeostasis and energy metabolism. Potassium channels, like the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel, influence membrane potential and cell survival. Chloride channels, although less studied, are involved in volume regulation and osmotic balance. The mitochondrial megachannel, a large conductance channel, is implicated in the release of apoptogenic factors. Porin, a voltage-dependent anion channel, facilitates the passage of small molecules and ions across the outer mitochondrial membrane. Understanding the structure, function, and regulation of these channels is vital for elucidating mitochondrial physiology and developing therapeutic strategies for mitochondrial disorders."}
