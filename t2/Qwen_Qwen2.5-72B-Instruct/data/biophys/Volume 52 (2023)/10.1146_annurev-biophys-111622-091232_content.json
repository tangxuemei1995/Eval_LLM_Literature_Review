{"Abstract": "ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a large family of membrane proteins that play crucial roles in various physiological processes, including lipid homeostasis, drug extrusion, and the maintenance of cellular barriers. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have provided unprecedented insights into the structure and mechanism of human ABC transporters. These studies reveal the intricate architecture of these proteins and their dynamic conformational changes during the transport cycle, which are powered by ATP hydrolysis. Understanding the molecular details of ABC transporter function is essential for elucidating the mechanisms underlying human diseases such as cystic fibrosis, multidrug resistance in cancer, and various metabolic disorders. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the structural and functional aspects of human ABC transporters, highlighting the implications for therapeutic intervention and the development of novel drugs targeting these proteins."}
