{"Abstract": "The dynamics of protein diffusion along DNA and protein lattices, such as microtubules, are critical for various cellular processes, including gene regulation and intracellular transport. This study investigates the role of electrostatic interactions and disordered regions in modulating the diffusion coefficient and sliding behavior of proteins. Using a combination of single-molecule tracking, molecular dynamics simulations, and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate that electrostatic interactions significantly enhance the diffusion rate of proteins along DNA and microtubules. Disordered regions, characterized by their flexible and unstructured nature, further facilitate the sliding process by reducing the energy barriers for protein movement. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying efficient DNA search and intracellular transport, highlighting the importance of both electrostatics and disordered regions in these processes."}
