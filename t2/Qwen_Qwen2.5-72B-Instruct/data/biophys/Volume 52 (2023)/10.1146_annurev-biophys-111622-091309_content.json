{"Abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a critical organelle responsible for the synthesis, folding, and quality control of secretory and membrane proteins. This study elucidates the mechanisms by which a coordinated Hsp40-Hsp70-Hsp90 system maintains protein quality in the ER. Using a combination of biochemical assays, live-cell imaging, and proteomic analyses, we demonstrate that Hsp40 and Hsp70 chaperones facilitate the initial folding and stabilization of nascent polypeptides, while Hsp90 plays a pivotal role in the maturation and trafficking of correctly folded proteins. Additionally, we identify key regulatory interactions between these chaperones and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery, which ensure the efficient removal of misfolded proteins. Our findings highlight the importance of this chaperone network in maintaining ER homeostasis and provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for ER stress-related diseases."}
