{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in time-resolved X-ray diffraction techniques, particularly serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX), have revolutionized the study of protein dynamics. These methods enable the capture of transient structural changes in proteins upon excitation, providing insights into the mechanisms of protein function at atomic resolution. By utilizing ultrafast X-ray pulses, SFX can probe the dynamics of proteins in their excited states, revealing the intricate interplay between structure and function. The application of electric fields in conjunction with time-resolved X-ray crystallography further enhances the ability to control and observe protein mechanics, offering a powerful tool for understanding the dynamic processes that govern protein behavior. This review highlights the latest developments in these techniques and their potential to elucidate the complex dynamics of proteins, paving the way for new discoveries in structural biology and biophysics."}
