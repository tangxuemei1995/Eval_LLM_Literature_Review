{"Abstract": "Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has emerged as a powerful technique for visualizing biological structures at near-atomic resolution, revolutionizing the field of virology. Coupled with cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling, cryo-ET enables the detailed examination of viruses in their native cellular environments. Recent advancements have led to a surge in in situ discoveries, providing unprecedented insights into viral assembly, infection mechanisms, and host interactions. This review highlights the technical advancements and key findings that have propelled cryo-ET to the forefront of structural virology."}
