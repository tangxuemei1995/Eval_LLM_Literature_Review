{"Abstract": "This review explores the theoretical and practical aspects of organizing and encapsulating multienzyme systems, focusing on metabolic engineering, protein scaffolds, and bacterial microcompartments. Metabolic engineering aims to optimize biochemical pathways for enhanced production of desired compounds. Protein scaffolds provide a means to spatially organize enzymes, improving catalytic efficiency and substrate channeling. Bacterial microcompartments, natural protein-based organelles, offer a sophisticated encapsulation strategy that can protect enzymes from environmental factors and increase local substrate concentrations. The integration of these approaches can lead to the development of more efficient and robust biocatalytic systems, with applications in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and environmental remediation. Recent advances in the design and engineering of these systems are discussed, highlighting the potential for creating novel synthetic compartments that mimic natural biological processes."}
