{"Abstract": "NLR proteins play a crucial role in innate immunity through the formation of resistosomes and inflammasomes. These multiprotein complexes are assembled upon ligand recognition, transitioning from an autoinhibited monomeric state to an active oligomeric holoenzyme. The NADase activity of certain NLRs, such as NLRP1, is essential for resistosome function, facilitating the formation of a membrane-permeable channel that mediates immune responses. Structural studies reveal the intricate architecture of these complexes, highlighting the mechanisms of autoinhibition, ligand-induced activation, and the assembly of the resistosome channel. Understanding these processes is vital for elucidating the regulation of innate immune responses and the development of therapeutic strategies."}
