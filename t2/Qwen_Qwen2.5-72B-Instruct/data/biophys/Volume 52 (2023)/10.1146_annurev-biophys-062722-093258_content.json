{"Abstract": "Free energy methods are essential tools in the computational description of molecular processes, enabling the accurate quantification of thermodynamic properties and the elucidation of complex biological phenomena. This review highlights recent advancements in free energy methods, particularly in the context of computer simulations, importance sampling, and enhanced sampling techniques. These methods are crucial for understanding processes such as recognition and association, permeation through biological membranes, and conformational transitions in proteins and nucleic acids. Importance sampling techniques, such as umbrella sampling and metadynamics, have significantly improved the efficiency and accuracy of free energy calculations, allowing for the exploration of rare events and metastable states. Enhanced sampling methods, including replica exchange and parallel tempering, further extend the applicability of these techniques to systems with high-dimensional free energy landscapes. The integration of these methods with advanced computational algorithms and hardware accelerators has opened new avenues for the detailed investigation of molecular processes, providing insights that are difficult to obtain through experimental means alone. This review discusses the theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and recent applications of free energy methods, emphasizing their role in advancing our understanding of molecular systems."}
