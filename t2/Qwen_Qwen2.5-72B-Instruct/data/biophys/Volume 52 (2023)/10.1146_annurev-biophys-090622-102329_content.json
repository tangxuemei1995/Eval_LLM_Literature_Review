{"Abstract": "The process of biological translation, which decodes the universal genetic code into functional proteins, is a fundamental aspect of molecular biology. This review explores the molecular interactions at the heart of this process, focusing on the stereochemical hypothesis and the role of noncovalent interactions. Aminoacyl tRNA-synthetases (aaRSs) play a crucial role by ensuring the accurate pairing of amino acids with their corresponding tRNAs, a process that is guided by specific noncovalent interactions. The mRNAâ€“protein complementarity hypothesis further suggests that the primary sequence of mRNA can influence protein structure and function through direct interactions. These interactions not only highlight the precision required for accurate translation but also provide insights into the evolutionary origins of the genetic code. Understanding these molecular mechanisms is essential for advancing our knowledge of protein synthesis and for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting translation."}
