{"Abstract": "This study employs hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods to elucidate the mechanisms of energy transduction in biomolecular machines, focusing on processes such as proton transfers, electron transfers, and nucleotide hydrolysis. By integrating high-level quantum mechanical descriptions of active sites with classical molecular mechanical models of the surrounding environment, we provide detailed insights into the energetics and dynamics of these critical biological processes. Our findings reveal the intricate interplay between local quantum events and the broader biomolecular context, highlighting the role of specific residues and structural motifs in facilitating efficient energy conversion. The results have significant implications for understanding the functional mechanisms of complex biological systems and for the design of biomimetic devices."}
