{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of systemic racism and psychological resilience among African Americans, drawing on a rich tapestry of autobiographical narratives and empirical research. By examining the lived experiences of individuals navigating racial adversity, the study highlights the cultural and personal strategies that foster resilience. Key findings reveal that strong community ties, cultural pride, and a sense of historical continuity play pivotal roles in mitigating the psychological impacts of racism. The research underscores the importance of recognizing and supporting these resilience factors in policy and practice, advocating for a more inclusive and equitable society. This work contributes to the broader discourse on race, diversity, and mental health, offering insights that can inform interventions and social change efforts."}
