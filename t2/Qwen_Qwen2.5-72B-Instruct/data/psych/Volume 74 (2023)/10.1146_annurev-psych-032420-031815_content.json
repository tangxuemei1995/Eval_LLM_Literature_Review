{"Abstract": "Evaluative conditioning (EC) is a fundamental process in attitude formation, where the affective evaluation of a neutral stimulus changes due to its repeated pairing with a valenced stimulus. This review synthesizes the extensive literature on EC, tracing its historical development, current understanding, and future directions. Historically, EC has been studied through classical conditioning paradigms, but recent research has expanded to include cognitive and neuroscientific approaches. The role of associations and propositions in EC is critically examined, highlighting how both automatic and deliberative processes contribute to attitude formation. External validity remains a key challenge, as laboratory findings often struggle to generalize to real-world settings. Future research should focus on integrating these processes and enhancing the ecological validity of EC studies to better understand their implications for social and consumer behavior. This comprehensive review aims to provide a robust foundation for advancing the field of EC and its applications."}
