{"Abstract": "This review examines the role of psychosocial and integrative oncology interventions in managing psychological distress, anxiety, and depression across the cancer disease trajectory. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, acceptance-based therapy, and mindfulness-based interventions are highlighted for their efficacy in reducing distress and improving quality of life. Emerging evidence supports the use of mind-body therapies and psychedelic-assisted therapy as complementary approaches to enhance emotional well-being and coping mechanisms. These interventions are particularly beneficial in addressing the unique challenges faced by patients at different stages of cancer, from diagnosis to survivorship. The integration of these therapies into standard oncology care is discussed, emphasizing the need for a holistic, patient-centered approach to support the psychological and physical health of individuals affected by cancer."}
