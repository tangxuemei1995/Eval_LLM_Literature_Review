{"Abstract": "This study explores the psychological dimensions of climate change, focusing on the factors that influence individual and collective climate action. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, the research identifies key psychological barriers and motivators, including personal values, climate change beliefs, and the perceived acceptability of various mitigation strategies. The findings suggest that while scientific consensus on climate change is robust, public engagement and action are significantly influenced by personal and cultural values. The study also highlights the importance of systemic change, arguing that individual actions, while necessary, are insufficient without broader structural reforms. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of developing more effective communication strategies and policies to enhance public engagement and support for climate action."}
