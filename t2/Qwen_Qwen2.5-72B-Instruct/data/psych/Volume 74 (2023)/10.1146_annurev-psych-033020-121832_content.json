{"Abstract": "This study investigates the determinants of social cognitive aging, focusing on the roles of social resources, context, motivation, and cognitive effort in predicting resilience and risk. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from a longitudinal study, we examine how these factors interact to influence cognitive outcomes in older adults. Results indicate that higher levels of social resources and supportive contexts are associated with greater cognitive resilience, while low motivation and reduced cognitive effort are linked to increased cognitive decline. The ecological validity of these findings is supported by real-world assessments of cognitive function. These insights provide a foundation for developing targeted interventions to enhance cognitive health in aging populations."}
