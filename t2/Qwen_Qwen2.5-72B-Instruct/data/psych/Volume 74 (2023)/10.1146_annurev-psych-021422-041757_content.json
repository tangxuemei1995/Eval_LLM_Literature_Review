{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between working memory and selective attention, highlighting how these cognitive processes facilitate anticipatory and expectational behaviors. By integrating findings from neuroimaging, behavioral experiments, and computational models, we demonstrate that working memory not only maintains and manipulates information but also dynamically guides attentional resources to optimize visual processing and action planning. Our results suggest that the prefrontal cortex plays a crucial role in this interplay, modulating attentional focus based on the contents of working memory. This mechanism allows for efficient anticipation of upcoming events and the preparation of appropriate responses, thereby enhancing behavioral adaptability. The implications of these findings extend to understanding cognitive disorders and developing more effective interventions for attention and memory deficits."}
