{"Abstract": "Pride, a self-conscious emotion, plays a pivotal role in the attainment and maintenance of social rank within human societies. This study explores the dual facets of pride—authentic and hubristic—and their differential impacts on social status. Authentic pride, associated with genuine achievement and competence, fosters prestige and respect, enhancing an individual’s social standing. Conversely, hubristic pride, linked to arrogance and narcissism, can lead to dominance but often at the cost of social cohesion. Through a series of experiments and longitudinal surveys, we demonstrate that individuals who exhibit authentic pride are more likely to attain and sustain high social rank through positive interpersonal relationships and contributions to group welfare. These findings underscore the nuanced role of pride in social dynamics and highlight the importance of understanding the emotional underpinnings of status attainment."}
