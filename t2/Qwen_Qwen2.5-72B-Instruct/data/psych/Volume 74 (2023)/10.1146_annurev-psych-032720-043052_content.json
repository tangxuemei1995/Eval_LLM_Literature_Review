{"Abstract": "This study explores the impact of gender stereotypes on the person-environment fit in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields, emphasizing the importance of diversity and inclusion. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical data from a diverse sample of STEM professionals, the research identifies key factors that influence the perception of fit for women and underrepresented genders. Findings suggest that persistent gender stereotypes not only deter entry into STEM but also affect retention and career advancement. The study highlights the need for targeted interventions to challenge these stereotypes and create inclusive environments that support the success of all genders. Recommendations include mentorship programs, gender-sensitive policies, and organizational culture changes to enhance the person-environment fit and promote gender equity in STEM."}
