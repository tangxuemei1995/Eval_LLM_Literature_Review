{"Abstract": "This paper presents an affect-regulation framework for understanding psychological resilience, emphasizing the role of emotion and emotion regulation in coping with adversity. Resilience is conceptualized as a dynamic process wherein individuals effectively manage emotional responses to stress, thereby maintaining or enhancing psychological health. The framework integrates theories of emotion regulation and stress, highlighting the importance of adaptive strategies such as cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. Empirical evidence supports the notion that resilient individuals exhibit greater flexibility in their affect-regulation strategies, allowing them to navigate challenging situations with greater ease. The implications of this framework for intervention and prevention programs are discussed, suggesting that enhancing affect-regulation skills can foster resilience and improve mental well-being in the face of stress and adversity."}
