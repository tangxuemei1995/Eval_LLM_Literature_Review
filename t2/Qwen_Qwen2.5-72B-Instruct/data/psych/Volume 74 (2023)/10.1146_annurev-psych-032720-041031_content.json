{"Abstract": "This study explores the mechanisms of human object vision, focusing on how the visual cortex processes and represents objects. Utilizing deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as a model, we investigate the hierarchical processing of visual information and its correspondence to human behavior in object recognition tasks. Our findings reveal that DCNNs can effectively simulate the complexity of object representations in the visual cortex, providing insights into the neural basis of object recognition. The results highlight the importance of both lower and higher-level features in the visual processing stream, suggesting a multi-faceted approach to understanding how the brain perceives and categorizes objects."}
