{"Abstract": "This study proposes a socioecological-genetic framework to explore the interplay between culture and personality, examining their roots, trends, and mutual influences. By integrating insights from socioecology and genetics, we investigate how environmental factors and genetic predispositions shape cultural norms and individual personality traits. The framework highlights the dynamic nature of both culture and personality, considering how they evolve over time through cultural change and personality development. We also emphasize the importance of nature–nurture interactions, particularly genes × environment (G×E) interactions, in understanding the complex mechanisms underlying these phenomena. Empirical evidence from longitudinal studies and cross-cultural research supports the framework, suggesting that both cultural and genetic factors play crucial roles in the development and expression of personality traits."}
