{"Abstract": "Sleep is a critical physiological process that significantly impacts cognitive functions such as memory and attention. This review synthesizes recent findings on the mechanisms by which sleep enhances cognitive performance, with a focus on the role of sleep structure and age-related changes. Studies indicate that specific sleep stages, particularly slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, are crucial for memory consolidation and cognitive restoration. Age effects on sleep, including reduced slow-wave activity and fragmented sleep patterns, are associated with cognitive decline. Moreover, sleep optimization strategies, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and creating a conducive sleep environment, are discussed as effective methods to improve cognitive function. This comprehensive analysis highlights the importance of understanding sleep's role in cognition and provides insights into potential interventions to enhance cognitive health across the lifespan."}
