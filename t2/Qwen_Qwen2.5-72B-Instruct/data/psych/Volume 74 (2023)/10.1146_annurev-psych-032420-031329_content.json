{"Abstract": "This paper provides a comprehensive definitional approach to understanding conspiracy theories, their correlates, consequences, and communication. By integrating insights from psychology, sociology, and communication studies, we delineate the key characteristics of conspiracy theories and explore the psychological and social factors that predict their endorsement. We examine the consequences of conspiracy beliefs on individual and societal levels, including their impact on trust, political engagement, and public health. Additionally, we analyze the role of media and social networks in the dissemination and reinforcement of conspiracy theories, highlighting the importance of effective communication strategies to mitigate their negative effects. This interdisciplinary approach offers a robust framework for future research and practical interventions aimed at addressing the pervasive nature of conspiracy theories in contemporary society."}
