{"Abstract": "Cancer-related stressors significantly impact both psychological and physiological health, necessitating effective stress management interventions. This review synthesizes evidence from 45 studies, evaluating the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and other stress management interventions in enhancing psychological and physiological adaptation among cancer patients and survivors. Findings indicate that CBT, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and relaxation techniques significantly reduce anxiety, depression, and fatigue while improving quality of life and immune function. These interventions facilitate better coping mechanisms, reduce stress hormone levels, and enhance overall health outcomes. The review highlights the importance of integrating stress management programs into comprehensive cancer care to support patients in achieving optimal health and well-being. Future research should focus on long-term outcomes and the customization of interventions to meet the diverse needs of cancer survivors."}
