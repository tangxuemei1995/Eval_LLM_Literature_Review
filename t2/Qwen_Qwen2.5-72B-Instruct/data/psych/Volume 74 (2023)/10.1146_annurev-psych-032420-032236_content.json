{"Abstract": "This study explores the concept of self-continuity, defined as the perception of consistency in one's identity over time, and its implications for attitudes, behavior, and psychological health. Drawing on a cross-cultural analysis, the research examines how individualistic and collectivistic cultures influence the development and maintenance of self-continuity. Findings indicate that individuals from collectivistic cultures, who emphasize interdependence and collective self, exhibit stronger self-continuity, which is positively associated with psychological well-being and prosocial behavior. In contrast, those from individualistic cultures, who prioritize personal autonomy, show weaker self-continuity, which is linked to higher levels of anxiety and less stable attitudes. The study also highlights the role of cultural values in shaping the collective self, suggesting that fostering a sense of continuity within a social context can enhance psychological health and promote adaptive behaviors. These insights have significant implications for interventions aimed at improving mental health and social cohesion across diverse cultural settings."}
