{"Abstract": "This study explores the development of color perception and cognition from infancy through childhood. Utilizing a combination of behavioral and neuroimaging techniques, we investigated how infants and young children process and categorize colors. Results indicate that color perception is present in infancy, with categorical color perception emerging around 18 months of age. Cognitive development, including language acquisition and memory, plays a crucial role in the maturation of color categorization. The findings suggest that while innate mechanisms provide a foundation for color perception, environmental and cultural factors significantly influence the development of color cognition. These insights contribute to our understanding of the interplay between perceptual and cognitive processes in early development."}
