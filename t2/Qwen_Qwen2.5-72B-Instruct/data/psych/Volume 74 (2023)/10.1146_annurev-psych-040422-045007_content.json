{"Abstract": "Careless responding, also known as insufficient effort responding, poses a significant threat to the validity and reliability of survey data. This paper reviews the current literature on the prevention, identification, and mitigation of careless responding in survey research. We discuss various preventive measures, such as clear instructions, attention checks, and engaging survey design. Identification techniques, including response time analysis, consistency checks, and machine learning algorithms, are evaluated for their effectiveness. Best practices for handling identified careless responses, such as data exclusion and statistical adjustments, are recommended to ensure the integrity of survey results. This comprehensive approach aims to enhance the quality and validity of survey data, providing researchers with robust tools to address the pervasive issue of careless responding."}
