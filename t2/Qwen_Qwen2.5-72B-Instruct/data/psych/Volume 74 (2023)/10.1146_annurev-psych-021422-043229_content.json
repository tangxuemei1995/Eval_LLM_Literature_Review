{"Abstract": "This paper explores the intricate relationship between vision and action, challenging traditional views that separate these processes. By integrating insights from neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy, we argue that vision and action are fundamentally intertwined, with each influencing the other in a dynamic and reciprocal manner. We examine how attention and consciousness modulate this interplay, highlighting the role of predictive coding and sensorimotor contingencies. Our findings suggest that a more holistic understanding of visual processing and motor control is essential for advancing theories of perception and action. This perspective has implications for both theoretical frameworks and practical applications, such as the development of more sophisticated artificial vision systems and rehabilitation strategies."}
