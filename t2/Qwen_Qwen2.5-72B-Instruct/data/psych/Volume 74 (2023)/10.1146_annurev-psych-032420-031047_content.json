{"Abstract": "Self-compassion, a multifaceted construct encompassing self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness, has emerged as a critical factor in promoting psychological well-being and resilience. This paper reviews the theoretical foundations of self-compassion, highlighting its distinction from self-esteem and its alignment with mindfulness practices. Methodological advancements in measuring self-compassion are discussed, including the development and validation of the Self-Compassion Scale. Empirical research demonstrates that higher levels of self-compassion are associated with reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression, enhanced emotional regulation, and greater life satisfaction. Interventions aimed at cultivating self-compassion, such as Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) training, have shown promising results in improving mental health outcomes. Future research should explore the mechanisms underlying the benefits of self-compassion and its potential as a protective factor against stress and adversity."}
