{"Abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release into the cytosol plays a critical role in innate immune signaling, contributing to inflammation and disease progression. Under stress conditions, such as infection or tissue damage, mtDNA can be released through mitochondrial pores, activating cytosolic DNA sensors like cGAS and AIM2. These sensors trigger the production of inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons, amplifying the immune response. However, excessive or uncontrolled mtDNA release can lead to chronic inflammation and autoimmune disorders. Recent studies have elucidated the mechanisms governing mitochondrial pore formation and the subsequent release of mtDNA, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for modulating innate immune responses. Understanding these pathways is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate inflammation and treat diseases associated with aberrant mtDNA release."}
