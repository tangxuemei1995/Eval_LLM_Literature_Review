{"Abstract": "This study provides a comprehensive structural analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying muscle contraction, focusing on the interactions between actin, myosin, troponin, and the ryanodine receptor. Utilizing advanced cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) techniques, we have elucidated the conformational changes in these proteins during the contraction cycle. Our findings reveal the precise binding sites and structural transitions of myosin heads on actin filaments, as well as the regulatory role of troponin in modulating these interactions. Additionally, we have mapped the structural dynamics of the ryanodine receptor, a key calcium release channel, which is essential for the initiation of muscle contraction. These insights enhance our understanding of the molecular basis of muscle function and provide a foundation for the development of therapeutic strategies for muscle disorders."}
