{"Abstract": "Rubisco, a pivotal carboxylase in the Calvin cycle, is central to carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms. Despite its essential role, Rubisco is known for its inefficiency, with a slow catalytic rate and a tendency to fix oxygen instead of carbon dioxide, leading to photorespiration. This review explores the evolutionary history of Rubisco, highlighting the diverse forms found across different taxa, from cyanobacteria to land plants. Recent advances in enzyme engineering have aimed to enhance Rubisco's catalytic efficiency and specificity, with strategies including directed evolution, rational design, and the introduction of alternative carboxylases. These efforts not only promise to improve photosynthetic efficiency in crops but also offer insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing Rubisco's function. The integration of these engineered enzymes into plant systems represents a promising avenue for increasing agricultural productivity and addressing global food security challenges."}
