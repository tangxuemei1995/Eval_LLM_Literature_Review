{"Abstract": "The intricate relationship between codon usage, tRNA abundance, and mRNA stability is a critical aspect of gene expression regulation. This review explores how codon optimality and tRNA availability influence translation elongation rates and, consequently, mRNA decay. Codons that are translated more efficiently due to higher tRNA abundance can lead to faster elongation, which in turn can affect the stability of the mRNA. Studies have shown that suboptimal codons can slow down translation, potentially exposing the mRNA to degradation pathways. Additionally, the use of specific codons can recruit RNA-binding proteins that modulate mRNA stability. This interplay between codon usage, translation efficiency, and mRNA decay highlights the multifaceted mechanisms by which cells fine-tune gene expression. Understanding these processes is essential for elucidating the regulatory networks that govern cellular function and for developing strategies to manipulate gene expression in therapeutic contexts."}
