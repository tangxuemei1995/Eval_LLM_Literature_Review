{"Abstract": "Cholesterol plays a crucial role in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is essential for embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. This relationship is mediated through the primary cilium, a cellular organelle that acts as a signaling hub. Cholesterol modulates the activity of the Hh receptor, Patched, and the G proteinâ€“coupled receptor, Smoothened, by influencing their localization and conformation within biological membranes. Disruptions in cholesterol homeostasis can lead to aberrant Hh signaling, contributing to developmental disorders and diseases such as cancer. This review highlights the molecular mechanisms underlying the interplay between cholesterol and Hh signaling, emphasizing the importance of lipid composition in the regulation of cell surface receptors and the primary cilium."}
