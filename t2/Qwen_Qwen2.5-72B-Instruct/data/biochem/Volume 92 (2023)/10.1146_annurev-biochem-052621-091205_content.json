{"Abstract": "Transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) is a specialized subpathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER) that preferentially repairs DNA damage in the transcribed strand of active genes. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing transcriptional arrest caused by UV-induced DNA damage. Unlike global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER), which operates throughout the genome, TC-NER is initiated by the stalling of RNA polymerase II at the site of damage. The recruitment of repair factors, such as the CSA and CSB proteins, is essential for the efficient removal of lesions and the resumption of transcription. Defects in TC-NER are associated with Cockayne syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by hypersensitivity to UV light, developmental abnormalities, and neurodegeneration. This review discusses the molecular mechanisms underlying TC-NER, its interplay with the transcriptional machinery, and the clinical implications of TC-NER deficiencies."}
