{"Abstract": "Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes play a crucial role in genome organization through the mechanism of DNA loop extrusion. Recent single-molecule studies have provided insights into the dynamic processes by which SMC complexes, such as cohesin and condensin, form and maintain loops along the chromatin fiber. These loops are essential for various cellular functions, including gene regulation, DNA replication, and chromosome segregation. This review summarizes the current understanding of how SMC complexes facilitate DNA loop extrusion, highlighting the molecular mechanisms and the implications for genome architecture and function."}
