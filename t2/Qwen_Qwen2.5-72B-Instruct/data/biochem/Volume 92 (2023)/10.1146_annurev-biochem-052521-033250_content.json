{"Abstract": "The activation mechanism of the insulin receptor (IR) is a critical process in cellular metabolism, involving intricate structural changes upon insulin binding. Recent advancements in cryo-EM have provided high-resolution insights into the conformational dynamics of the IR. This study elucidates the structural transitions at insulin-binding sites 1 and 2, which are essential for receptor activation. The binding of insulin to site 1 induces a conformational shift that propagates through the ectodomain, leading to the exposure of site 2. This sequential binding and structural rearrangement facilitate the dimerization and autophosphorylation of the IR, ultimately activating downstream signaling pathways. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for insulin-related disorders."}
