{"Abstract": "RNA modifications play a crucial role in the regulation of mRNA metabolism and function, contributing to the complexity of the epitranscriptome. These chemical alterations, including methylation, pseudouridylation, and acylation, can influence various aspects of posttranscriptional regulation, such as mRNA stability, splicing, and translation efficiency. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled the comprehensive mapping of these modifications, revealing their dynamic nature and potential regulatory mechanisms. This review highlights the current understanding of how RNA modifications modulate mRNA fate and function, emphasizing their impact on gene expression and cellular processes."}
