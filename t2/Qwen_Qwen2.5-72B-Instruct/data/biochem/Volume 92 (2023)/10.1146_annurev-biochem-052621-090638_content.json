{"Abstract": "The Radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme superfamily plays a crucial role in a wide array of biological processes, including the biosynthesis of complex natural products and the repair of DNA. These enzymes initiate radical chemistry through the reductive cleavage of SAM, generating a highly reactive 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical. This radical is then used to initiate a diverse array of organometallic reactions, often involving the activation of unreactive substrates. Recent studies have elucidated the mechanism of radical initiation, highlighting the importance of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in the reduction of SAM and the subsequent formation of the 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical. This review summarizes the current understanding of the radical initiation mechanism in Radical SAM enzymes, emphasizing the structural and mechanistic insights gained from recent biochemical and spectroscopic studies."}
