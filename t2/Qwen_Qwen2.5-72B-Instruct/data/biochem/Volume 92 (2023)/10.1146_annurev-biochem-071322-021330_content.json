{"Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Polyamines, including putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, play critical roles in cellular processes, but their dysregulation can contribute to neurotoxicity. This review explores the dual role of polyamines in PD, highlighting their interactions with mitochondria and endo/lysosomal systems, which are key organelles implicated in PD pathogenesis. Polyamines can modulate Î±-synuclein aggregation, a hallmark of PD, and influence astrocyte function, which is crucial for maintaining neuronal health. While excessive polyamine levels can exacerbate neurotoxicity, controlled polyamine metabolism may offer neuroprotective benefits. Understanding the balance between these effects could provide new therapeutic targets for PD."}
