{"Abstract": "The field of epitranscriptomics has emerged as a critical area of study, focusing on the dynamic modifications of mRNA that regulate gene expression. This review highlights the roles of key proteins involved in mRNA modification, including methyltransferases (writers), reader proteins, and demethylases (erasers). Specifically, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal modification in eukaryotic mRNA, influencing various aspects of RNA metabolism such as splicing, stability, and translation. Methyltransferase complexes, such as METTL3 and METTL14, are responsible for adding m6A marks, while demethylases like FTO and ALKBH5 remove these modifications. Reader proteins, including YTH domain-containing proteins, recognize and bind to m6A-modified RNA, mediating downstream functional outcomes. Understanding the interplay between these proteins is essential for elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of the epitranscriptome and their implications in cellular processes and disease."}
