{"Abstract": "Thiolase represents a versatile biocatalyst that employs coenzyme A (CoA)–thioester chemistry to facilitate the formation and cleavage of carbon–carbon (C–C) bonds. This enzyme is characterized by a unique active site architecture, featuring an oxyanion hole and a hydrogen-bond network that stabilizes transition states and intermediates during catalysis. The proton wire, a series of hydrogen-bonded residues, plays a critical role in proton transfer, enhancing the efficiency of the Claisen condensation and thioester hydrolysis reactions. These features enable thiolase to catalyze a wide range of reactions, making it a valuable tool in biocatalysis and synthetic biology. This review highlights the structural and mechanistic insights into thiolase, emphasizing its potential applications in the synthesis of complex organic molecules and the development of novel biocatalytic processes."}
