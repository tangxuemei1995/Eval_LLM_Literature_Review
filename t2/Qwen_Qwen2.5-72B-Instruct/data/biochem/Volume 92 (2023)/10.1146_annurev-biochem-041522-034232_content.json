{"Abstract": "Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a specialized subpathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER) that preferentially repairs DNA damage in the transcribed strand of active genes. This process is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing mutagenesis, particularly in highly expressed genes. Key factors involved in TCR include the transcription-repair coupling factor Mfd in bacteria and CSB in eukaryotes, which recognize RNA polymerase stalling at damaged sites and recruit NER machinery. Recent studies have highlighted the role of TCR in the regulation of the circadian clock, suggesting a link between DNA repair and circadian gene expression. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of TCR not only provides insights into the cellular response to DNA damage but also has implications for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting mutagenesis and circadian disorders."}
