{"Abstract": "The development of base editors, which enable precise modification of single nucleotides in DNA, has revolutionized the field of genome editing. This review focuses on the design and application of DNA-editing enzymes, including deaminases, methyltransferases, demethylases, and glycosylases, as base editors. Through protein engineering, these enzymes have been optimized to enhance their specificity, efficiency, and versatility. Base editors have been successfully applied in various organisms, from bacteria to mammals, for correcting genetic mutations, studying gene function, and developing therapeutic strategies. However, challenges such as off-target effects and delivery methods remain. This paper discusses recent advancements, current limitations, and future directions in the field of base editing, highlighting the potential of these tools in both research and clinical settings."}
