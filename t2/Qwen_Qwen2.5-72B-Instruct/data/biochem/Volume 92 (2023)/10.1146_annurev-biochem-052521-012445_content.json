{"Abstract": "The 3′-end processing of eukaryotic pre-mRNA is a critical step in gene expression, involving the precise cleavage and polyadenylation of the transcript. This process, mediated by a complex machinery including endonucleases and poly(A) polymerases, ensures the stability and translational efficiency of mature mRNA. The cleavage site is recognized by a consensus sequence, and the addition of the poly(A) tail is regulated by various factors, including transcriptional pausing and the interplay between RNA-binding proteins and the transcription machinery. Dysregulation of 3′-end processing can lead to aberrant mRNA levels and is implicated in several diseases. Recent studies have highlighted the dynamic nature of this process, revealing its impact on alternative polyadenylation and the fine-tuning of gene expression in response to cellular signals."}
