{"Abstract": "Active colloids, a class of self-propelled particles, have emerged as a paradigmatic model system for studying nonequilibrium phenomena in soft matter. These particles, capable of converting energy from their environment into directed motion, exhibit complex collective behaviors that are not observed in passive systems. This review highlights recent advances in the design, synthesis, and application of active colloids, emphasizing their potential as both fundamental models for active matter and as functional materials and machines. We discuss the role of interparticle interactions, external fields, and confinement in shaping the dynamic assemblies and emergent properties of active colloidal systems. Furthermore, we explore the prospects of using active colloids in various technological applications, including targeted drug delivery, environmental remediation, and microscale actuation. The challenges and future directions in the field are also addressed, underscoring the interdisciplinary nature of research at the interface of physics, chemistry, and engineering."}
