{"Abstract": "This study presents a novel hybrid approach that integrates machine learning (ML) techniques with traditional physical models to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of thermodynamic predictions for fluid mixtures. By leveraging the strengths of both methodologies, the proposed model effectively captures complex non-linear interactions within the mixture while maintaining a solid foundation in thermodynamic principles. The ML component is trained on a comprehensive dataset of experimental thermodynamic properties, allowing it to generalize well across a wide range of conditions. The hybrid model demonstrates superior performance in predicting phase behavior, critical points, and other thermodynamic properties compared to conventional methods, offering significant potential for applications in chemical engineering and materials science."}
