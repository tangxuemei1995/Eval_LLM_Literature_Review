{"Abstract": "The development of peptide-based vectors for gene delivery represents a promising strategy in biomolecular engineering, particularly for the intracellular delivery of therapeutic molecules such as silencing RNA (siRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA), and oligonucleotides. These vectors leverage the unique properties of intracellular targeting peptides to enhance cellular uptake and endosomal escape, critical steps for effective gene delivery. Recent advancements have demonstrated the potential of these vectors in various preclinical models, showing improved stability, reduced toxicity, and enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Clinical trials are underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of peptide-based vectors for treating genetic disorders and cancers. This review summarizes the current state of peptide-based gene delivery systems, highlighting key design considerations, mechanisms of action, and the latest findings from preclinical and clinical studies. The integration of these vectors into therapeutic strategies holds significant promise for personalized medicine and the treatment of previously intractable diseases."}
