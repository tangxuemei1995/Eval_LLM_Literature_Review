{"Abstract": "This review highlights the recent advancements in in situ and operando characterization techniques for electrochemical CO2 reduction, focusing on the elucidation of reaction mechanisms, catalyst dynamics, and electrolyte interactions. Techniques such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry are discussed for their ability to probe reaction intermediates and catalyst active sites under working conditions. These methods provide critical insights into the structural and electronic changes that occur during the reduction process, enabling the design of more efficient and stable catalysts for CO2 conversion."}
