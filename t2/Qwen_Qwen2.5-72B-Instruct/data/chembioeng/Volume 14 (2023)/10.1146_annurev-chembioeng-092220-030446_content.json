{"Abstract": "This study examines the pivotal role of international oil companies (IOCs) in facilitating the transition to a net-zero emission energy system. IOCs, traditionally focused on oil and gas, are increasingly diversifying into renewable energy sources and advanced energy storage solutions. The research highlights the unique capabilities of IOCs in energy transport and storage, leveraging their extensive infrastructure and expertise in energy carriers with high energy density. Through a comprehensive review of recent initiatives and strategic investments, the study demonstrates how IOCs can contribute to reducing carbon emissions while ensuring energy security. Key findings include the potential for IOCs to lead in the development of hydrogen as a clean energy carrier and the integration of carbon capture and storage technologies. The analysis underscores the importance of policy support and collaborative efforts between IOCs, governments, and other stakeholders to accelerate the energy transition."}
