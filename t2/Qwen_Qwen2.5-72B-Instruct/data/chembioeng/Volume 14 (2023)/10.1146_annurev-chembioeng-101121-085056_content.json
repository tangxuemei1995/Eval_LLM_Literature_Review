{"Abstract": "This study investigates the evaporation dynamics and pattern formation in sessile drops of colloidal dispersions. Through a combination of experimental observations and theoretical modeling, we explore the influence of particle concentration, substrate properties, and environmental conditions on the drying process. Our findings reveal the emergence of distinct evaporative patterns, including coffee-ring effects and uniform coatings, which are governed by evaporation-driven flows within the drop. The research also highlights the role of particle-particle and particle-substrate interactions in determining the final deposit morphology. These insights are crucial for optimizing the drying of complex fluids in various industrial and technological applications, such as inkjet printing and thin-film deposition."}
