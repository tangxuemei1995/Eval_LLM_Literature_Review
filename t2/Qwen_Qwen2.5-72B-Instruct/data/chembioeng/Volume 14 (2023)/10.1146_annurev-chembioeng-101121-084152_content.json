{"Abstract": "This review explores the current state and future prospects of lignocellulosic biorefineries, focusing on the production of biobased polymers. Lignocellulosic biomass, a renewable and abundant resource, offers significant potential for sustainable chemical production. However, the efficient valorization of this biomass into high-value products faces several challenges, including pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, and fermentation processes. Recent engineering innovations, such as integrated bioprocessing and advanced separation technologies, have shown promise in enhancing the economic viability and environmental sustainability of biorefineries. Life-cycle management approaches are crucial for optimizing resource use and minimizing environmental impacts. This paper also highlights emerging opportunities in biobased polymer production, such as the development of novel biopolymers and the integration of circular economy principles. These advancements are essential for transitioning towards a more sustainable and resilient biobased economy."}
