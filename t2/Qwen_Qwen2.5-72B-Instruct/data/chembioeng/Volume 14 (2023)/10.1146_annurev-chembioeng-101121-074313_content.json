{"Abstract": "This study explores the challenges and strategies involved in scaling up photochemical reactions from laboratory to industrial production. Key approaches, including numbering up and sizing up, are discussed, with a focus on the integration of flow chemistry to enhance process efficiency and control. The role of photocatalysis in optimizing reaction conditions and improving scalability is highlighted. Case studies demonstrate the successful transition of photochemical processes, emphasizing the importance of reactor design and operational parameters in achieving consistent and scalable industrial-scale photochemical synthesis."}
