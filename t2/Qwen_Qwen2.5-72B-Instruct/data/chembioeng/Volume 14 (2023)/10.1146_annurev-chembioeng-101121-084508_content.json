{"Abstract": "The escalating challenge of pathogen immune evasion necessitates innovative strategies in antibody engineering to enhance therapeutic efficacy. This review explores recent advancements in passive immunization and vaccine development, focusing on Fc engineering, bispecific antibodies, and antibodyâ€“drug conjugates (ADCs). Fc engineering optimizes antibody effector functions, improving their ability to recruit immune cells and neutralize pathogens. Bispecific antibodies, designed to simultaneously target two distinct antigens, offer enhanced specificity and potency. ADCs combine the targeting precision of antibodies with the cytotoxic power of drugs, providing a potent weapon against infectious diseases. These engineered antibodies represent a promising frontier in combating pathogens that have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to evade the immune system, offering new hope for the development of more effective and durable therapeutic interventions."}
