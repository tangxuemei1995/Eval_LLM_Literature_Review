{"Abstract": "Deep eutectic solvents (DESs), a class of green solvents, have garnered significant attention due to their unique properties and potential applications in various fields. This review provides a comprehensive overview of DESs, focusing on their formation, properties, and applications. DESs are typically composed of a hydrogen bond donor and a hydrogen bond acceptor, which, when mixed in specific ratios, exhibit a significant melting temperature depression, leading to the formation of a liquid phase at room temperature. The solidâ€“liquid equilibrium of DESs is influenced by the nature of the components and their ability to form hydrogen bonds, which can be tailored for specific applications. This review also discusses the environmental benefits of DESs, their role in green chemistry, and the challenges associated with their large-scale production and application. The potential of DESs in catalysis, extraction, and material synthesis is highlighted, underscoring their importance in sustainable chemical processes."}
