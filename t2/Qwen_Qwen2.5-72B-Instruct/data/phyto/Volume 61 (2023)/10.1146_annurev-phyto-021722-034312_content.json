{"Abstract": "Functional peptides have emerged as promising alternatives to conventional chemical pesticides for the control of plant diseases. These peptides, derived from natural sources such as plants, animals, and microorganisms, exhibit a broad spectrum of antifungal, antibacterial, and antiviral activities. The mechanisms of action of these peptides are diverse, including membrane disruption, enzyme inhibition, and interference with cellular processes of plant pathogens. Recent advances in biotechnology have facilitated the production of functional peptides through recombinant DNA technology and peptide synthesis, making them more accessible and cost-effective. This review highlights the natural sources of functional peptides, their mechanisms of action against plant pathogens, and the current methods for their production. Additionally, the potential of these peptides as novel biopesticides is discussed, emphasizing their role in sustainable agriculture and the challenges associated with their commercialization. The integration of functional peptides into integrated pest management strategies could provide a robust and environmentally friendly approach to plant disease control."}
