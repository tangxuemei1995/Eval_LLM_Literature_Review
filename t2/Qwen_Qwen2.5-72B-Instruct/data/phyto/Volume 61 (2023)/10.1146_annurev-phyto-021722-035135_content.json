{"Abstract": "Induced resistance (IR) represents a promising strategy to enhance the postharvest quality and shelf life of fruits and vegetables by activating their innate defense mechanisms. This review explores the physiological factors that contribute to IR, focusing on how these mechanisms can be harnessed to limit postharvest disease development. Key physiological processes, such as the production of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, the reinforcement of cell walls, and the modulation of phytohormone signaling, are discussed in the context of their roles in delaying maturation and ripening. The application of elicitors, such as chitosan, salicylic acid, and jasmonic acid, has been shown to effectively induce resistance, reducing the incidence of fungal and bacterial pathogens. Additionally, the integration of IR with other postharvest management practices, such as controlled atmosphere storage and modified packaging, can further enhance the effectiveness of disease control. This comprehensive approach not only extends the shelf life of produce but also reduces the reliance on chemical fungicides, promoting sustainable agricultural practices."}
