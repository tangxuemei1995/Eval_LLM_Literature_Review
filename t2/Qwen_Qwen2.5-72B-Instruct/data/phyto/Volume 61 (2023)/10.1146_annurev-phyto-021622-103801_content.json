{"Abstract": "Phytophthora capsici, a destructive oomycete pathogen, has been a significant threat to vegetable crops worldwide since its initial description a century ago. Recent advancements in understanding its fundamental biology have shed light on its genetic diversity, host range, and mechanisms of pathogenicity. Studies have revealed the importance of effector proteins in host manipulation and the role of environmental factors in disease development. Despite these insights, the management of P. capsici remains challenging due to its rapid adaptation and the emergence of fungicide resistance. Integrated disease management strategies, including resistant cultivars, cultural practices, and the judicious use of fungicides, are crucial for sustainable control. This review summarizes the latest findings on the biology of P. capsici and highlights the current approaches and future directions for managing this economically important plant pathogen."}
