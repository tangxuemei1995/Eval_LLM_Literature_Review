{"Abstract": "Ralstonia solanacearum, a notorious plant pathogen, causes bacterial wilt disease, posing a significant threat to global agriculture. This bacterium employs a diverse arsenal of virulence strategies, including the secretion of effector proteins and the manipulation of plant hormone signaling, to overcome host defenses. Its ability to adapt to various environmental conditions and evolve rapidly has contributed to its widespread distribution and persistence in soil. Recent research has highlighted the role of the plant microbiota in modulating R. solanacearum's virulence and the potential for biological control methods, such as the use of beneficial microorganisms, to mitigate its impact. Understanding the complex interactions between R. solanacearum, the plant, and the environment is crucial for developing effective resistance strategies and sustainable management practices."}
