{"Abstract": "This review explores the evolving landscape of integrated nematode management (INM) in the context of global agricultural transitions. It highlights the critical role of the plant microbiome and root health in enhancing plant resilience against nematode infections. The paper discusses recent advancements in genome editing and genetics, which offer promising tools for developing nematode-resistant crop varieties. Additionally, it examines the application of remote sensing technologies for early detection and monitoring of nematode infestations, enabling precision agriculture practices. The review also addresses the policy frameworks necessary to support INM, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and stakeholder engagement. By integrating these diverse approaches, the paper outlines a comprehensive strategy to address the constraints and challenges of nematode management in a changing world."}
