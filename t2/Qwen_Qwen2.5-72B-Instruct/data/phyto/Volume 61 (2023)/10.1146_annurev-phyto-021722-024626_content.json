{"Abstract": "The global forest health crisis, exacerbated by biological invasions, climate change, and other anthropogenic pressures, represents a critical public-good social dilemma that demands urgent international collective action. This study synthesizes recent findings on the impacts of global change on forest ecosystems, highlighting the role of invasive species and climate-induced stressors in accelerating forest decline. We argue that the conservation of biodiversity and the sustainable management of natural resources are essential for mitigating these threats. Through a review of existing natural resource policies and international agreements, we identify key gaps and propose a framework for enhanced collaboration among nations. This framework emphasizes the need for integrated strategies that address both the drivers and the symptoms of forest degradation, fostering a resilient and sustainable future for global forest ecosystems."}
