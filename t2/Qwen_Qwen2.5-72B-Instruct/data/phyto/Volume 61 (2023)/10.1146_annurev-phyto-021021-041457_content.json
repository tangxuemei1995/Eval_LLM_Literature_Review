{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of network analyses to understand the organization and function of microbiomes in plant and soil ecosystems. By examining co-occurrence and coassociation patterns, we identify distinct modules within microbial networks that correlate with specific ecological functions. These modules, which are more than the sum of their individual components, provide insights into the complex interactions and dependencies within microbiomes. Our findings highlight the importance of network structure in predicting microbial community responses to environmental changes and suggest new avenues for manipulating microbiomes to enhance plant health and soil fertility."}
