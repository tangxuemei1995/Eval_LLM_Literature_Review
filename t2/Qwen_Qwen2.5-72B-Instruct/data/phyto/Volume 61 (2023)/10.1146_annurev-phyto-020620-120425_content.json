{"Abstract": "The reemergence of phycopathology highlights the critical intersection of algal biology, ecology, and biosecurity. This review synthesizes recent advancements in understanding algal diseases, emphasizing their impact on algal aquaculture and natural ecosystems. Emerging pathogens and parasitic interactions are explored, revealing complex ecological dynamics and potential biosecurity threats. The integration of molecular tools and ecological modeling enhances our ability to predict and manage algal disease outbreaks, underscoring the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in phycopathology."}
