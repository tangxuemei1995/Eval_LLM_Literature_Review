{"Abstract": "The ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) is a critical regulatory mechanism in plants, governing protein degradation and maintaining proteostasis. Pathogens have evolved sophisticated effector proteins to manipulate the UPS, thereby subverting plant immunity and promoting infection. These effectors can interfere with ubiquitination processes, target key immune regulators for degradation, or mimic host proteins to evade detection. Understanding how pathogens exploit the UPS provides insights into plant defense mechanisms and offers potential targets for developing resistance strategies. This review highlights recent advances in elucidating the molecular interactions between plant UPS components and microbial effectors, emphasizing the dynamic interplay that shapes plant–pathogen coevolution."}
