{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate coevolutionary dynamics between viruses and their plant hosts within geographic centers of diversity, focusing on the Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) as a model system. By integrating data from molecular phylogenetics, historical biogeography, and plate tectonics, we elucidate the long-term evolutionary arms race between host resistance and viral adaptation. Our findings reveal that centers of crop diversity, such as those in the Andes and Mesoamerica, have served as hotspots for the coevolution of plant resistance genes and viral countermeasures. The analysis of viral genome sequences and host resistance loci indicates a pattern of recurrent selection and diversification, driven by the dynamic interplay between host and pathogen. Additionally, the role of plate tectonics in shaping the distribution of these interactions is highlighted, suggesting that geological events have influenced the spatial and temporal patterns of hostâ€“pathogen coevolution. This research underscores the importance of understanding these coevolutionary processes for the development of sustainable strategies to manage plant diseases in agricultural systems."}
