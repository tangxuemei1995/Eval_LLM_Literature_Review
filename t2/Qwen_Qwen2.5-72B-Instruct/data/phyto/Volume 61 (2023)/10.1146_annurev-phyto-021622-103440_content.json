{"Abstract": "Downy mildews, caused by oomycete pathogens, pose significant threats to global agriculture. This study leverages telomere-to-telomere genome assemblies to provide unprecedented insights into the biology and evolution of these pathogens. We identify a diverse array of effector genes, which are crucial for host manipulation and pathogenicity. The analysis reveals extensive heterokaryosis, a condition where multiple nuclei coexist within a single cell, suggesting a mechanism for rapid somatic adaptation. This genetic diversity facilitates the rapid evolution of new pathotypes, complicating disease management. Additionally, the genome data enable the development of biosurveillance tools for early detection and monitoring of downy mildew outbreaks. These findings enhance our understanding of oomycete biology and provide a foundation for developing more effective control strategies."}
