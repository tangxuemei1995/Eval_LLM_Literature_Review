{"Abstract": "The intricate relationship between plants and their associated microbiota has been a focal point of agricultural research, particularly in the context of crop improvement. This study explores the potential of engineering the crop microbiota through host genetics, leveraging the natural co-evolutionary processes that have occurred during domestication. By analyzing the root and rhizosphere microbiomes of diverse crop species, we identify key genetic loci that influence microbial community composition. Our findings suggest that specific plant traits, such as root architecture and exudate profiles, can be selectively bred to enhance beneficial microbial associations. This approach not only optimizes plant health and productivity but also reduces the reliance on chemical inputs. Through a combination of genomic and metagenomic analyses, we demonstrate that targeted plant breeding can significantly alter the microbiota, leading to improved nutrient uptake, disease resistance, and stress tolerance. This research paves the way for a new era of sustainable agriculture, where the manipulation of plant-microbe interactions through host genetics plays a central role in crop improvement."}
