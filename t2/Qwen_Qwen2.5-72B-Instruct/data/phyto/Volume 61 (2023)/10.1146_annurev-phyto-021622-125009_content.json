{"Abstract": "Agrobacteria, a genus of phytopathogens, are renowned for their ability to transfer DNA into plant cells, a process mediated by tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmids. This study integrates evolutionary genomics to elucidate the virulence mechanisms and ecological dynamics of Agrobacteria. Through comparative genomics of diverse Agrobacterium strains, we identified key genomic elements and plasmid variations that correlate with virulence. Phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct evolutionary lineages, suggesting adaptive radiation in response to host specificity and environmental pressures. The presence of mobile genetic elements, such as transposons and integrative conjugative elements, was found to contribute to the rapid evolution of virulence traits. Our findings highlight the dynamic interplay between genomic plasticity and ecological niches, providing insights into the molecular basis of Agrobacterium pathogenicity and its implications for plant health and biotechnological applications."}
