{"Abstract": "Kitaviruses, including members of the genera Cilevirus, Higrevirus, and Blunervirus, represent a unique group of plant viruses that cause nonsystemic diseases, primarily transmitted by the polyphagous mite Brevipalpus. These viruses are characterized by their atypical genomic organization and replication strategies, which differ significantly from those of systemic plant viruses. Notably, citrus leprosis, a devastating disease affecting citrus crops, is caused by a cilevirus and has been extensively studied due to its economic impact. Recent advances in molecular biology and next-generation sequencing have provided insights into the genetic diversity and evolution of kitaviruses, revealing their complex interactions with host plants and vectors. This review highlights the current understanding of kitavirus biology, emphasizing the role of Brevipalpus mites in disease transmission and the potential for developing novel control strategies. Understanding these atypical viruses is crucial for managing plant diseases and enhancing crop resilience in the face of emerging viral threats."}
