{"Abstract": "Plant pathogens, including fungi and oomycetes, employ sophisticated strategies to subvert host cellular processes, particularly membrane trafficking, to facilitate infection. This review highlights recent advances in understanding how pathogen effectors manipulate endomembrane trafficking, autophagy, and protein secretion pathways to suppress plant immunity and promote pathogen colonization. Specifically, effectors target key components of the plant's endomembrane system, such as SNARE proteins and Rab GTPases, to disrupt vesicle trafficking and autophagosome formation. Additionally, some effectors hijack the host's secretory pathway to deliver virulence factors directly into plant cells. The formation of specialized infection structures, such as haustoria, further underscores the importance of membrane trafficking in pathogen-host interactions. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing novel strategies to enhance plant resistance against pathogens."}
