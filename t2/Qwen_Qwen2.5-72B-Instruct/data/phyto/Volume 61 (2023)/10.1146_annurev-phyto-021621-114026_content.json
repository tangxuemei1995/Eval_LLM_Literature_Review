{"Abstract": "Plant-pathogenic bacteria employ sophisticated mechanisms to manipulate host metabolism, facilitating infection and promoting virulence. This study explores the role of host metabolites as signaling molecules that regulate bacterial virulence, particularly through inter-kingdom signaling pathways. We demonstrate that specific plant metabolites can activate the type III secretion system (T3SS) and the expression of effector proteins, which are crucial for bacterial pathogenicity. These metabolites act as cues that trigger the bacteria to adapt their virulence strategies in response to the host's metabolic state. Our findings highlight the importance of metabolic signaling in the plant-bacteria interaction and provide insights into potential targets for enhancing plant immunity against pathogenic bacteria."}
