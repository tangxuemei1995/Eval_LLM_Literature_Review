{"Abstract": "This study investigates the impact of viral and bacterial diseases on the international trade and local production of ornamental plants. The global ornamental plant industry is highly susceptible to the spread of pathogens, which can lead to significant economic losses and regulatory challenges. Through a comprehensive review of recent outbreaks and their consequences, this research highlights the critical role of international trade in the dissemination of diseases such as Xylella fastidiosa and Tomato spotted wilt virus. The study also examines the effectiveness of current regulatory measures and proposes enhanced surveillance and quarantine protocols to mitigate the risk of disease spread. Findings indicate that a collaborative approach involving producers, regulators, and researchers is essential to protect the ornamental plant industry and maintain its economic viability."}
