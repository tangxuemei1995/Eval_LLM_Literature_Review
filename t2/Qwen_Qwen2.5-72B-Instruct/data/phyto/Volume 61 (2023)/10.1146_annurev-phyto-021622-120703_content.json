{"Abstract": "Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus (ToBRFV), a member of the Tobamovirus genus, has emerged as a significant threat to global tomato and pepper production. This study reviews the current state of knowledge regarding ToBRFV, including its transmission via seeds and mechanical means, and the critical role of seed hygiene in preventing its spread. We also examine the development of resistant cultivars and the implementation of integrated management strategies to control the virus. Findings indicate that while seed testing and sanitation practices are essential, the development of resistant varieties remains a priority for long-term management. This review underscores the need for collaborative efforts among researchers, breeders, and growers to mitigate the impact of ToBRFV on crop yields and economic stability."}
