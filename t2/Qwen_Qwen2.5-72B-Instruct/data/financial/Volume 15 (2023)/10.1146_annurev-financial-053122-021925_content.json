{"Abstract": "This study revisits the efficiency of pari-mutuel betting markets, focusing on racetracks and lotteries. Using stochastic programming optimization models, we analyze the favorite-longshot bias and its implications for bettors. The research reveals that while racetrack markets exhibit a significant favorite-longshot bias, lottery strategies can be optimized to mitigate this effect. The findings suggest that bettors can improve their outcomes by adopting strategic approaches, particularly in identifying and exploiting inefficiencies in the markets. The study contributes to the understanding of market dynamics and offers practical insights for participants in pari-mutuel betting systems."}
