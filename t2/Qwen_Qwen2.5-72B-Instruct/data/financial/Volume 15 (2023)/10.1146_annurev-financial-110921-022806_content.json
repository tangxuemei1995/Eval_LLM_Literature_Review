{"Abstract": "This paper explores the role of smart contracts in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, focusing on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and protocols for loanable funds (PLFs). By leveraging the Ethereum blockchain, smart contracts enable trustless and automated financial services, enhancing transparency and reducing intermediation costs. The study analyzes the mechanisms of DEXs and PLFs, highlighting their potential to revolutionize traditional financial systems. However, it also addresses the challenges, including security vulnerabilities and regulatory uncertainties, that must be overcome for widespread adoption. Empirical data from leading DeFi platforms are used to illustrate the current state and future prospects of this emerging field."}
