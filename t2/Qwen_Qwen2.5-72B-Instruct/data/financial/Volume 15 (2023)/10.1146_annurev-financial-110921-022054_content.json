{"Abstract": "This study examines the evolving landscape of state and local pension funds in the United States, focusing on trends in pension costs, funding levels, and the impact of retirement policies on government debt. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from 2000 to 2020, the analysis reveals a significant increase in unfunded liabilities, driven by demographic shifts, investment shortfalls, and policy decisions that have delayed necessary reforms. The research highlights the growing financial pressure on state and local governments, which has been exacerbated by economic downturns and the increasing cost of healthcare for retirees. The findings suggest that without substantial changes in pension policies, including adjustments to benefit structures and increased contributions, the sustainability of these funds remains at risk. The study also explores potential solutions, such as hybrid pension models and improved investment strategies, to address the long-term challenges facing public pension systems."}
