{"Abstract": "This study examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on fixed income markets, focusing on the liquidity, volatility, and credit spreads. Using a comprehensive dataset of bond prices and trading volumes, we find that the onset of the pandemic led to a significant increase in market volatility and a widening of credit spreads, particularly for lower-rated corporate bonds. The analysis also reveals a sharp decline in market liquidity, with trading volumes plummeting and bid-ask spreads widening. These findings highlight the fragility of fixed income markets during periods of extreme economic stress and underscore the need for robust regulatory frameworks to mitigate systemic risks.
