{"Abstract": "This paper examines the role of fiscal capacity in asset pricing, focusing on the term structure of interest rates and the maturity of government debt. We incorporate the concept of convenience yield, which reflects the benefits of holding government debt as a safe asset, into a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. Our findings suggest that a higher fiscal capacity, characterized by a more flexible and credible fiscal policy, can lead to a flatter term structure and a lower convenience yield, thereby influencing the pricing of long-term bonds. The implications of these results for monetary-fiscal policy coordination and financial stability are discussed."}
