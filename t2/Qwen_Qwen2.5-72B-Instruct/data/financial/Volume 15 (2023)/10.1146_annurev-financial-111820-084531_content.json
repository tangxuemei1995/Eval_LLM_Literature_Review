{"Abstract": "This paper introduces the theme on the social discount rate (SDR), a critical parameter in government valuation of public investment projects, particularly in the context of long-term environmental policies such as climate change mitigation. The SDR reflects the trade-offs between current and future benefits and costs, influencing decisions on the cost of carbon and intergenerational equity. We review the theoretical foundations and empirical methods used to estimate the SDR, highlighting the ethical, economic, and social considerations that underpin its determination. The paper also discusses the implications of different SDR values on policy outcomes, emphasizing the need for a transparent and robust approach to its application in public policy. By synthesizing recent research and debates, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the SDR and its role in shaping sustainable and equitable public investments."}
