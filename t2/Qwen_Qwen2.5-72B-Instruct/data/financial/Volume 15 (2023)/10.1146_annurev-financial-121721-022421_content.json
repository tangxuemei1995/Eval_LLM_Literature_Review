{"Abstract": "This paper explores the legal and philosophical foundations of the social discount rate (SDR) in the context of intertemporal and intergenerational decision-making. The SDR is a critical parameter in benefit-cost analysis, influencing how future costs and benefits are valued relative to the present. We examine the ethical implications of discounting future welfare, considering both utilitarian and deontological perspectives. The legal dimension is analyzed through the lens of regulatory frameworks and judicial interpretations, highlighting the role of the SDR in environmental and economic policies. The paper argues that a balanced approach, integrating both ethical and legal considerations, is necessary to ensure that the SDR reflects societal values and promotes sustainable development. Through a review of existing literature and case studies, we provide insights into the challenges and potential solutions in setting an appropriate SDR for long-term policy decisions."}
