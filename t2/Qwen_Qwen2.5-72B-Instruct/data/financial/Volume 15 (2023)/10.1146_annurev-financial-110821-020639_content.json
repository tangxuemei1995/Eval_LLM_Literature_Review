{"Abstract": "This study reviews the application of epidemiological models in forecasting the spread of COVID-19. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from global health organizations, we analyze the performance of various models, including SIR, SEIR, and agent-based models, in predicting infection rates, hospitalizations, and fatalities. The findings highlight the importance of real-time data integration and model adaptability to account for interventions such as social distancing and vaccination. The study also underscores the limitations of these models, particularly in scenarios with high uncertainty and rapid changes in public health policies. Our results provide valuable insights for policymakers and public health officials in managing future pandemics."}
