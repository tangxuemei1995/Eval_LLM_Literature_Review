{"Abstract": "This study explores the impact of missing participants and incomplete markets on the social discount rate, focusing on the roles of borrowing constraints, intergenerational transfers, altruism, and the desire for legacy. By integrating theoretical models with empirical data, we examine how these factors influence individual and collective decision-making processes. Our findings suggest that borrowing constraints and the lack of complete markets lead to higher social discount rates, as individuals prioritize short-term gains over long-term investments. However, the presence of altruism and the desire for legacy can mitigate these effects, promoting more sustainable and equitable outcomes. This research contributes to the understanding of how social and economic structures shape intertemporal choices and policy implications for addressing market inefficiencies."}
