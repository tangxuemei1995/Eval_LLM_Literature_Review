{"Abstract": "This study explores the critical issue of algorithmic fairness in machine learning, particularly in the context of credit scoring. We examine various fairness metrics and their implications on reducing bias in algorithmic decision-making processes. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical analysis, we identify key challenges and propose a framework for evaluating and mitigating bias. Our findings highlight the importance of transparent and accountable algorithms, suggesting that a multi-faceted approach, including regulatory oversight and technical innovations, is essential for achieving fairer outcomes in credit scoring systems."}
