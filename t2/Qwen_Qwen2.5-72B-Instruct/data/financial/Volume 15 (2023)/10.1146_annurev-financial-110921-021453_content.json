{"Abstract": "This study investigates the dynamics of forward rates under the Q-measure, focusing on the interplay between volatility, correlation, and no-arbitrage conditions. By employing advanced pricing models, we analyze how changes in market volatility and correlation structures impact the term structure of forward rates. Our findings reveal that the Q-measure dynamics significantly influence the pricing and hedging of interest rate derivatives, providing insights into the underlying market mechanisms that ensure no-arbitrage conditions are maintained."}
