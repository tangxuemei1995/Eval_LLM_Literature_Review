{"Abstract": "This paper explores the enigmatic aspects of sovereign debt, focusing on the paradoxes and puzzles that challenge conventional economic theories. By analyzing historical data and contemporary case studies, the research delves into the dynamics of sovereign default and the sustainability of public debt. Key findings reveal that despite high debt levels, some countries maintain stable financial conditions, while others face recurrent crises. The study highlights the role of political stability, institutional quality, and international financial support in mitigating the risks of sovereign default. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between economic policies and global financial markets."}
