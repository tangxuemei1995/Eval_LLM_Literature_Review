{"Abstract": "This paper addresses the critical issue of reforming public discounting systems to better align with long-term sustainability goals. Current discounting practices often undervalue future costs and benefits, particularly in the context of environmental and social impacts. We propose a framework that incorporates risk adjustment and dynamic discount rates to more accurately reflect the uncertainties and long-term risks associated with climate change and other sustainability challenges. The integration of carbon pricing into cost-benefit analysis is emphasized as a key mechanism to internalize environmental externalities. Empirical evidence from case studies demonstrates that these adjustments can lead to more robust and equitable policy decisions, ensuring that future generations are not disproportionately burdened by current economic activities."}
