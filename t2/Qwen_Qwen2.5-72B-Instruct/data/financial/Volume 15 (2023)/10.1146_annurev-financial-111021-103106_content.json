{"Abstract": "This paper explores the methodologies and challenges associated with utilizing microdata for macro-finance research. By leveraging detailed individual or firm-level data, researchers can gain deeper insights into the mechanisms driving macroeconomic and financial phenomena. The paper discusses the importance of proper identification strategies to ensure that micro-level behaviors are accurately linked to macroeconomic outcomes. It also addresses the aggregation issues that arise when scaling up microdata to the macro level, emphasizing the need for robust statistical techniques to mitigate potential biases. Through a review of recent empirical studies, the paper highlights successful applications of microdata in areas such as consumption dynamics, asset pricing, and business cycle analysis. The findings underscore the value of microdata in enhancing our understanding of macro-finance, while also identifying key areas for future research to further refine these methods."}
