{"Abstract": "This study explores the multifaceted dimensions of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), focusing on the integration of responsible shareholder mandates and sustainable finance practices. By analyzing the impact of externalities and the emergence of greeniums, the research highlights the growing importance of corporate decarbonization efforts. The findings suggest that companies adopting robust CSR strategies not only mitigate environmental and social risks but also enhance their financial performance and investor appeal. The study provides empirical evidence supporting the notion that sustainable finance can drive positive change, aligning corporate goals with broader societal and environmental objectives."}
