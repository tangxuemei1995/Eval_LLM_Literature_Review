{"Abstract": "This study examines the pricing and risk management of inflation-adjusted bonds, swaps, and derivatives using the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) model. By incorporating the term structure of interest rates and inflation, we derive a framework for valuing inflation-indexed securities and their derivatives. The model allows for the accurate calculation of break-even inflation rates, which are crucial for investors and policymakers. Empirical analysis using market data confirms the model's effectiveness in capturing the dynamics of inflation and interest rates, providing insights into the pricing of inflation-linked instruments."}
