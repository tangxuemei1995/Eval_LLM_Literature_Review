{"Abstract": "This study examines the theory and empirical evidence surrounding swing pricing, a mechanism used by mutual funds to manage liquidity and protect long-term investors from the costs associated with large inflows and outflows. We analyze the impact of swing pricing on fund performance, liquidity transformation, and the potential for fire sales. Using a comprehensive dataset of mutual funds, we find that funds employing swing pricing exhibit lower liquidity risk and reduced price impact during periods of market stress. Our results suggest that swing pricing can effectively mitigate the adverse effects of liquidity mismatches, thereby enhancing the overall stability and fairness of the mutual fund market. The findings have important implications for regulatory policies aimed at improving liquidity management practices in the financial industry."}
