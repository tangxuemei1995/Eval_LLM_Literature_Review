{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of climate stress testing as a critical tool for assessing and managing climate-related risks to financial stability. By integrating climate risk into traditional financial stress testing frameworks, the research aims to identify potential vulnerabilities in the financial system that could arise from physical and transition risks associated with climate change. The methodology involves the development of scenario analysis, incorporating both acute and chronic climate impacts, as well as policy and technological shifts. The findings highlight the significant exposure of financial institutions to climate-related systemic risks, emphasizing the need for proactive regulatory measures and enhanced disclosure practices. The study also underscores the importance of cross-sector collaboration to develop robust climate resilience strategies, ensuring the long-term stability of the financial system. Through a comprehensive analysis of case studies and empirical data, the research provides actionable insights for policymakers, regulators, and financial institutions to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on financial stability."}
