{"Abstract": "This paper explores the applicability and limitations of financial economics in determining the social discount rate (SDR) for government projects. The SDR is a critical parameter in cost-benefit analysis, influencing decisions on public investments and resource allocation. While financial economics provides valuable insights into market-based valuation and risk assessment, its direct application to government projects is constrained by the unique characteristics of public sector finance. The paper examines how concepts such as fair value accounting and budgetary accounting differ from private sector practices, highlighting the need for a nuanced approach to government cost of capital. It argues that while market-derived discount rates can inform the SDR, they must be adjusted to reflect social objectives, long-term impacts, and the non-market nature of many government activities. The discussion also considers the implications of these adjustments for transparency and accountability in public financial management."}
