{"Abstract": "This study examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on household financial behavior, focusing on consumption, credit, and investment patterns. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset of household financial transactions and survey responses, we find that the pandemic led to a significant reduction in discretionary spending and an increase in savings, particularly among higher-income households. The introduction of government stimulus measures temporarily boosted consumption but did not fully offset the overall decline. Credit usage decreased as households sought to reduce debt and improve financial resilience. Investment activities were cautious, with a shift towards safer assets. These findings highlight the complex and heterogeneous responses of households to economic shocks and the importance of targeted policy interventions to support financial stability during crises."}
