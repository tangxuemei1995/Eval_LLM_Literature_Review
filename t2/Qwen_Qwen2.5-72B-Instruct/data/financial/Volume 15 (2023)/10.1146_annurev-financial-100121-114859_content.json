{"Abstract": "This paper examines the historical context and evolution of banking crises, focusing on the critical roles of intermediation, leverage, and the lender of last resort in maintaining financial stability. By analyzing key episodes from the 19th century to the present, we identify recurring patterns and structural vulnerabilities that have precipitated systemic failures. The study highlights the importance of regulatory frameworks and central bank interventions in mitigating the severity and frequency of crises. Historical lessons underscore the need for robust risk management practices and the continuous adaptation of financial policies to address emerging challenges in the global economy."}
