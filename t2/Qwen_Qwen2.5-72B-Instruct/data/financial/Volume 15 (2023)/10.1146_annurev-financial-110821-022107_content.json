{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to macro-financial stability, particularly in emerging markets. This paper reflects on the immediate and long-term impacts of the crisis, emphasizing the role of monetary policy in mitigating economic disruptions. We analyze how central banks and financial regulators have responded, including the implementation of unconventional measures to ensure liquidity and support credit markets. The study highlights the importance of international cooperation and the need for robust policy frameworks to address the vulnerabilities exposed by the pandemic. Empirical evidence suggests that while these measures have provided temporary relief, they also raise concerns about potential long-term financial stability risks, such as increased debt levels and asset price distortions. The paper concludes with recommendations for policymakers to enhance resilience and prepare for future crises."}
