{"Abstract": "The transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to alternative rate benchmarks marks a significant shift in the global financial landscape. This study examines the characteristics and implications of the new short-term rate benchmarks, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in the United States, and the continued use of credit-sensitive rates such as Euribor in Europe. We analyze the adoption of risk-free rates (RFRs) and credit-sensitive rates (CSRs) in various financial instruments, particularly interest rate derivatives. The research highlights the challenges and benefits associated with the transition, such as the reduction of systemic risk and the potential for basis risk in hybrid financial products. Additionally, the study explores the role of emerging benchmarks like Ameribor, BSBY, and AXI in providing credit-sensitive alternatives. Empirical evidence suggests that while RFRs offer greater stability and transparency, CSRs continue to be favored in certain markets due to their alignment with underlying credit conditions. The findings underscore the need for a nuanced approach to benchmark selection, balancing regulatory requirements with market preferences."}
