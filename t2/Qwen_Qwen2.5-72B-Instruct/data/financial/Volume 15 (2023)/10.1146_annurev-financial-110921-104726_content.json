{"Abstract": "This study examines the relationship between inflation and asset returns, focusing on the predictability of bond returns and the impact of monetary policy. Using a comprehensive dataset, we find that inflation significantly affects risk premia and asset pricing, particularly during periods of stagflation. Our results suggest that monetary policy plays a crucial role in mitigating the adverse effects of inflation on financial markets, highlighting the importance of policy stability and transparency. The findings have implications for investors and policymakers in managing economic risks and optimizing portfolio strategies."}
