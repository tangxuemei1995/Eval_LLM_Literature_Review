{"Abstract": "This paper develops a class of macro-finance models that incorporate nonlinear dynamics, focusing on dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) frameworks. The models account for systemic risk and endogenous jump risk, integrating financial constraints and liquidity issues. By extending traditional DSGE models, the analysis reveals how nonlinearities in financial markets can amplify economic fluctuations and affect policy outcomes. Empirical applications demonstrate the model's ability to capture key features of financial crises and business cycles, providing insights into the design of macroprudential policies."}
