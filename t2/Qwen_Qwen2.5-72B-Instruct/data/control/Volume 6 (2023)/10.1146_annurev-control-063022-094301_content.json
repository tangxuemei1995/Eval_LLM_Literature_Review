{"Abstract": "This study explores the role of embodiment in the development of autonomous adaptive systems, focusing on the intricate cross-timescale interactions that underpin embodied intelligence. By integrating principles from bioinspired robotics, we investigate how physical morphology and sensorimotor capabilities influence the adaptive behaviors of these systems. Our findings highlight the importance of multi-scale temporal dynamics, from fast sensory-motor loops to slower learning and evolutionary processes, in achieving robust and flexible autonomy. Through a series of simulations and robotic experiments, we demonstrate that carefully designed embodied systems can effectively navigate complex, dynamic environments, showcasing the potential of bioinspired approaches in advancing the field of autonomous adaptive systems."}
