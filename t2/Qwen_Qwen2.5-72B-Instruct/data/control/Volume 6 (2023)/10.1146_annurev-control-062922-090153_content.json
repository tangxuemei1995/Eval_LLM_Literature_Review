{"Abstract": "This paper explores the integration of adaptive control techniques with reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the adaptability, optimality, and robustness of control systems in dynamic environments. Adaptive control, traditionally focused on system parameter adjustments to maintain stability and performance, is complemented by RL's ability to learn optimal policies through interaction with the environment. The study presents a novel framework that combines model-based adaptive control with model-free RL algorithms, enabling real-time adaptation to unknown or changing system dynamics. Through simulations and experimental validations, the proposed approach demonstrates superior performance in terms of stability, convergence speed, and robustness to disturbances compared to conventional adaptive control methods. The findings highlight the potential of this hybrid approach in applications such as robotics, autonomous systems, and process control, where adaptability and optimality are critical."}
