{"Abstract": "This paper aims to establish a theoretical foundation for policy optimization methods in the context of learning control policies, a critical aspect of reinforcement learning (RL). Policy optimization algorithms, which iteratively improve policies by adjusting parameters based on performance feedback, have shown significant success in complex control tasks. However, the theoretical underpinnings that explain their effectiveness and convergence properties remain underdeveloped. We address this gap by integrating concepts from feedback control synthesis, a well-established field in control theory, to provide a rigorous analysis of policy optimization. Specifically, we derive conditions under which policy optimization algorithms can guarantee convergence to optimal policies, and we explore the implications of these conditions for the design of more robust and efficient RL algorithms. Our theoretical framework not only enhances the understanding of existing methods but also paves the way for the development of novel algorithms that can better handle the challenges of real-world control problems."}
