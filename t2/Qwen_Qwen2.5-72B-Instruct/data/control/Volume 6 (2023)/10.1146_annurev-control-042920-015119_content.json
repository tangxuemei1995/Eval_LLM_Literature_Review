{"Abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive review of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, also known as particle filters, which are widely used for state estimation in nonlinear and non-Gaussian state-space models. We discuss the fundamental principles of SMC, including importance sampling, resampling, and propagation, and highlight recent advances in improving efficiency and accuracy. The review covers various applications, from tracking and navigation to system identification and signal processing. We also address the challenges of high-dimensional state spaces and propose strategies to mitigate particle degeneracy and improve computational performance. This unified review aims to provide a clear and accessible overview of SMC methods for researchers and practitioners in the field."}
