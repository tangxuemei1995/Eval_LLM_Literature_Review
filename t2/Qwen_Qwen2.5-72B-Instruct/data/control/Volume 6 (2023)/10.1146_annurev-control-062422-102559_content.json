{"Abstract": "This study explores the exploitation of liquid surface tension and capillary forces for enhancing microrobotic manipulation and locomotion. Surface tension, a fundamental property of liquids, plays a critical role in the behavior of microscale systems due to the dominance of surface forces over gravitational and inertial forces at these scales. By leveraging these forces, microrobots can perform intricate tasks such as object manipulation, assembly, and transportation in microenvironments. The research presents a novel microrobotic design that utilizes capillary bridges to achieve precise control over microscale objects. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in various micromanipulation tasks, including the assembly of microcomponents and the transportation of liquid droplets. The study also investigates the impact of different liquid properties, such as viscosity and surface tension, on the performance of the microrobots. The findings suggest that optimizing these properties can significantly enhance the efficiency and versatility of microrobotic systems, opening new avenues for applications in microfabrication, biotechnology, and environmental monitoring."}
