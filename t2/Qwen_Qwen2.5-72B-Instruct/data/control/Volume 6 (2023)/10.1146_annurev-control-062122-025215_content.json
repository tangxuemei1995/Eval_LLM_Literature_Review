{"Abstract": "This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in grasp learning, focusing on models, methods, and performance metrics. We explore how machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning and reinforcement learning, have advanced the field of robotic grasping and manipulation. Key challenges, such as generalization to novel objects and real-time adaptability, are discussed. The review also highlights recent benchmarks and datasets that facilitate the evaluation and comparison of different grasp learning approaches. Our analysis underscores the importance of integrating sensory feedback and physical interaction to improve the robustness and versatility of robotic grasping systems."}
