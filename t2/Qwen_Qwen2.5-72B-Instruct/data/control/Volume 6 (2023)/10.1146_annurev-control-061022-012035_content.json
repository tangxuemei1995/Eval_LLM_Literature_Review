{"Abstract": "This paper explores the integration of additive manufacturing techniques, including 4D printing, to develop advanced soft actuators and robots. By leveraging the unique properties of soft materials and the precision of 3D and 4D printing, we demonstrate the fabrication of integrated soft actuators and sensors with complex geometries and multifunctional capabilities. The use of stimuli-responsive materials in 4D printing enables the creation of soft robots that can adapt to their environment and perform tasks with enhanced dexterity and autonomy. Experimental results highlight the potential of these technologies in applications ranging from biomedical devices to adaptive manufacturing systems, paving the way for the next generation of soft robotics."}
