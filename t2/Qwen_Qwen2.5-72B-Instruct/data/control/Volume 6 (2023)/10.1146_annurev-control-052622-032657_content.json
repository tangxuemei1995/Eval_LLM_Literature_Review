{"Abstract": "This paper addresses the challenges and solutions for controlling low-inertia power systems, which are increasingly prevalent due to the high penetration of renewable energy sources and power electronics-based devices. The study explores advanced control strategies, including grid-forming control and dynamic virtual power plant (VPP) approaches, to enhance system stability and reliability. Grid-forming control is evaluated for its ability to emulate synchronous generator behavior, while dynamic VPPs are investigated for their potential to aggregate and manage distributed energy resources effectively. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of these control methods in maintaining frequency and voltage stability, even under significant disturbances. The findings contribute to the development of robust control frameworks essential for the transition to more sustainable and resilient power systems."}
