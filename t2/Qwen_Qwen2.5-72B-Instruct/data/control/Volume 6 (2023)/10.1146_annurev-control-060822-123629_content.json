{"Abstract": "This paper explores the modeling and control of crowd dynamics in multiagent systems, focusing on the interaction and coordination of autonomous vehicles. By employing the mean-field limit approach, we analyze the behavior of large-scale interacting agent systems, where each agent follows predefined rules and interacts with its neighbors. The study introduces a feedback control mechanism to manage the collective behavior, ensuring stability and efficiency in the system. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy in mitigating congestion and improving flow in various scenarios, including urban traffic and pedestrian movements. The findings contribute to the development of intelligent transportation systems and crowd management solutions, highlighting the potential of mean-field theory in optimizing multiagent systems."}
