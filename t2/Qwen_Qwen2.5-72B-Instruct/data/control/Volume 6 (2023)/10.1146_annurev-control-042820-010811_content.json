{"Abstract": "This paper explores the multifaceted role of information in networked estimation and control systems, focusing on the integration of cyber-physical systems (CPS) and the challenges posed by communication constraints. In networked control systems (NCS), the timely and accurate exchange of data is crucial for maintaining system stability and performance. We analyze how timing information and event-triggering mechanisms can be leveraged to optimize resource usage while ensuring reliable operation. The paper also delves into decentralized inference, where multiple agents must collaboratively estimate system states with limited communication. Through a combination of theoretical analysis and simulation studies, we demonstrate the impact of communication protocols on estimation accuracy and control performance. Key findings include the development of novel algorithms that adapt to varying network conditions and the identification of critical thresholds for communication delays and data rates. These insights are essential for the design of robust and efficient CPS, particularly in applications such as autonomous vehicles, smart grids, and industrial automation."}
