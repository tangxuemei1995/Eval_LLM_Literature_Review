{"Abstract": "This study explores the mechanisms and effectiveness of embodied communication in human–robot collaboration, focusing on how physical interaction enhances communication and cooperation between humans and robots. Through a series of experiments involving assistive robots in various assistive tasks, we investigated how different forms of physical interaction, such as guiding, pushing, and pulling, influence the efficiency and quality of communication. Results indicate that embodied communication significantly improves task performance and user satisfaction, as it allows for more intuitive and natural interaction. The study also highlights the importance of designing robots with the capability to interpret and respond to physical cues, which can lead to more seamless and effective human–robot collaboration. These findings have implications for the development of assistive robots in healthcare, manufacturing, and domestic settings, where physical interaction is a critical component of the human–robot relationship."}
