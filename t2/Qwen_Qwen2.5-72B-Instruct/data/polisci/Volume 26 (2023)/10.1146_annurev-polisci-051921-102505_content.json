{"Abstract": "This study examines the evolving political role of business leaders, particularly in the context of lobbying, civic engagement, and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Drawing on a comprehensive analysis of corporate activities and public statements from 2010 to 2023, the research highlights how business leaders, especially CEOs, have increasingly become vocal on social and political issues. The findings reveal that while traditional lobbying efforts remain significant, there is a growing trend of CEO activism, where leaders use their platforms to advocate for policy changes and social causes. This shift is driven by a combination of internal corporate values, stakeholder pressures, and the recognition of the business community's influence on public policy. The study also explores the implications of this trend for corporate governance and the potential for enhanced civic engagement, suggesting that business leaders are becoming more integral to the political landscape, shaping both public opinion and policy outcomes."}
