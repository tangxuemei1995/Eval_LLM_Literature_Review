{"Abstract": "This paper explores the dynamics of authoritarian power sharing, a phenomenon where autocratic regimes distribute political authority among various factions to maintain stability and prevent coups. By integrating insights from the literature on civil wars, commitment problems, and institutional design, we examine the mechanisms through which authoritarian leaders manage internal threats and external pressures. We argue that power-sharing arrangements, such as coalition governments, military pacts, and patronage networks, serve as strategic tools to balance competing interests and reduce the likelihood of regime collapse. Through a comparative analysis of case studies, we highlight the conditions under which these arrangements are effective and the challenges they face. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the resilience and adaptability of authoritarian regimes in the face of internal and external challenges."}
