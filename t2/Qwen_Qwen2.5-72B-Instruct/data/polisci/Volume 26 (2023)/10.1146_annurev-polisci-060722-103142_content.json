{"Abstract": "This paper explores the intricate relationship between democracy and policing in the United States, particularly through the lens of multiracial democracy and racial authoritarianism. It examines how historical and contemporary policing practices have shaped and been shaped by democratic institutions, often reinforcing racial hierarchies and undermining the principles of equal protection and due process. The study draws on a range of interdisciplinary sources, including political science, sociology, and critical race theory, to analyze the ways in which policing intersects with identity and criminal justice. Through case studies and empirical data, the paper highlights the challenges and opportunities for reform, emphasizing the need for a more inclusive and equitable approach to law enforcement that aligns with democratic values. The findings suggest that fostering a multiracial democracy requires not only electoral reforms but also a fundamental rethinking of the role of policing in society, with a focus on community engagement, accountability, and the reduction of racial disparities in the criminal justice system."}
