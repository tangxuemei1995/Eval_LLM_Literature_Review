{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between supply chain governance and the multi-level context in which it operates, emphasizing the role of network structures, environmental factors, and labor dynamics. By adopting a polycentric perspective, the research examines how governance mechanisms at different levels—firm, network, and institutional—interact to manage complexity and achieve sustainable outcomes. The analysis reveals that effective governance requires a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within and between these levels, highlighting the importance of context in shaping governance strategies. Empirical evidence from case studies across diverse industries underscores the need for adaptive and collaborative approaches to address the challenges of modern supply chains, such as regulatory compliance, ethical labor practices, and environmental sustainability. The findings contribute to the theoretical framework of supply chain governance by integrating insights from network theory, institutional theory, and complexity science."}
