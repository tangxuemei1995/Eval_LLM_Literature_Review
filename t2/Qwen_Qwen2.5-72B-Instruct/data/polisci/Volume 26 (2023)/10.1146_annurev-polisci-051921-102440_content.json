{"Abstract": "This paper explores the evolution and current state of historical political economy (HPE), emphasizing its role in understanding the legacies and persistence of historical events on contemporary political and economic outcomes. By integrating insights from history, economics, and political science, HPE offers a robust framework for causal inference, allowing researchers to trace the long-term impacts of historical institutions, policies, and events. The paper reviews key methodological advancements, including the use of formal theory and quantitative methods, which have enhanced the precision and reliability of HPE research. It also highlights emerging areas of inquiry, such as the intergenerational transmission of political attitudes and the role of historical trauma in shaping current economic behaviors. Finally, the paper discusses the future directions of HPE, advocating for a more interdisciplinary approach and the incorporation of new data sources to deepen our understanding of the complex interplay between history and modern political economy."}
