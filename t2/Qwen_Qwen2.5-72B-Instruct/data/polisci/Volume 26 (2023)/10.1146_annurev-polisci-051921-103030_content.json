{"Abstract": "This study explores the divergent trajectories of growth and welfare regimes across different historical periods and geographical contexts, focusing on the transition from Fordist industrialization to financialization and the emergence of the knowledge-based economy. By employing a comparative political economy framework, the research examines how varying institutional configurations and policy choices have shaped economic growth and social welfare outcomes. The analysis reveals that while the overarching trend towards economic modernization is consistent, the specific paths taken by different countries have led to distinct outcomes in terms of income distribution, labor market dynamics, and social protection. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the interplay between global economic forces and national institutional contexts in shaping growth and welfare regimes."}
