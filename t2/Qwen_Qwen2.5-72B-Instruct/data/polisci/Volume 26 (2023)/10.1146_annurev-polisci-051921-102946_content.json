{"Abstract": "This study examines the economic backgrounds of political elites, focusing on their class, education, and wealth, to assess their impact on representation. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset of politicians from various countries, the research reveals a significant overrepresentation of individuals from upper socioeconomic classes and prestigious educational institutions. The analysis indicates that wealthier politicians are more likely to advocate for policies that benefit the economic elite, potentially undermining the democratic principle of equal representation. The findings suggest that the economic homogeneity among political elites may perpetuate social and economic inequalities, highlighting the need for reforms to enhance diversity and inclusivity in political institutions."}
