{"Abstract": "This paper examines the evolving landscape of international energy politics in the context of climate change, focusing on the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy sources. The analysis highlights the complex interplay between global environmental goals and the economic interests of major oil-producing nations. It explores how distributive politics influence the pace and direction of the clean energy transition, particularly in regions heavily reliant on oil exports. The study also assesses the role of international agreements and policies in facilitating or hindering this transition, and discusses the implications for global energy security and economic stability. Through a multidisciplinary approach, the paper provides insights into the strategic challenges and opportunities that arise as the world seeks to balance energy needs with climate imperatives."}
