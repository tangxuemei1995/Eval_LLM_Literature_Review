{"Abstract": "This study explores the paradoxical role of violence within nonviolent resistance movements, focusing on the concept of 'violent flanks' and their impact on the overall effectiveness of such movements. Through a comprehensive review of historical cases, including the U.S. Civil Rights Movement and the Arab Spring, the research examines how the presence of violent elements, such as riots and unarmed collective violence, can influence public perception, media coverage, and state responses. The findings suggest that while nonviolent movements generally achieve higher success rates, the strategic use or containment of violent flanks can either enhance or undermine their goals. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the complex dynamics between nonviolent protesters and violent actors, providing insights for activists, policymakers, and scholars."}
