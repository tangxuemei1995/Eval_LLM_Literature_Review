{"Abstract": "This paper explores the intricate dynamics of bureaucratic politics, focusing on the often-overlooked aspects of personnel appointments, performance oversight, and accountability mechanisms. By examining the influence of lobbying and procurement processes, the study identifies key blind spots in current political science literature. It argues that these areas significantly shape bureaucratic behavior and policy outcomes, yet remain under-theorized. Through a combination of case studies and quantitative analysis, the research highlights opportunities for enhancing transparency and effectiveness in bureaucratic systems. The findings suggest that a more nuanced understanding of these dynamics is crucial for improving governance and public administration."}
