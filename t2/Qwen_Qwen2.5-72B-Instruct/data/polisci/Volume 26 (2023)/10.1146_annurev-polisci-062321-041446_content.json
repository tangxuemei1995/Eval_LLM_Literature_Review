{"Abstract": "This study examines the political dimensions of racist dehumanization in the United States, focusing on how racial attitudes and prejudice shape the perception and treatment of Black and Indigenous communities by white Americans. Through a comprehensive analysis of survey data, historical documents, and contemporary media, the research reveals that dehumanizing rhetoric and policies are not only prevalent but are often politically motivated. The findings indicate that dehumanization is a strategic tool used to justify systemic inequalities and to mobilize support for policies that disproportionately harm marginalized racial groups. The study also highlights the role of political leaders and institutions in perpetuating these attitudes and the potential for counter-narratives to challenge and dismantle racist dehumanization."}
