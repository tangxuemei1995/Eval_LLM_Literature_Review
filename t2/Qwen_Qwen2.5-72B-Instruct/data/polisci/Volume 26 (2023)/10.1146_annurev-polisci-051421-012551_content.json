{"Abstract": "This study integrates context and contact theory to explore how the built environment and neighborhood characteristics influence political behavior and ethnic politics. By examining the interplay between physical surroundings and social interactions, we argue that the design of urban spaces can either exacerbate or mitigate political inequalities. Using a mixed-methods approach, including spatial analysis and survey data, we find that neighborhoods with higher levels of mixed-use development and walkability promote greater inter-ethnic contact, leading to more inclusive political attitudes and behaviors. Conversely, areas characterized by segregation and poor infrastructure are associated with heightened political polarization and reduced civic engagement. These findings underscore the importance of considering both the physical and social dimensions of the environment in understanding and addressing political inequalities."}
