{"Abstract": "This study examines the extent and mechanisms of political inequality in affluent democracies, focusing on the interplay between participation, representation, and policy responsiveness. Using a comparative analysis of advanced economies, we find that higher income inequality and weaker trade unions are associated with lower levels of political participation and representation among lower-income groups. The analysis reveals a significant gap in policy congruence, where the preferences of the affluent are more likely to be reflected in policy outcomes. The findings suggest that structural factors, such as income inequality and the strength of civil society organizations, play a crucial role in shaping political inequality. Policy recommendations include strengthening trade unions and implementing measures to enhance political engagement among marginalized populations to promote more equitable representation."}
