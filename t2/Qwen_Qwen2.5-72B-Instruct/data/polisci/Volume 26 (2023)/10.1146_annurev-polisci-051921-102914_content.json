{"Abstract": "This paper explores the concept of bureaucratic autonomy, examining how it is defined and measured in the context of political control, delegation, and discretion. Through a comparative analysis of administrative systems, the study identifies key dimensions of bureaucratic autonomy, including the extent of political oversight, the degree of discretion afforded to bureaucrats, and the legal frameworks that govern administrative actions. The research draws on case studies from various countries to illustrate how different political and legal contexts shape the autonomy of bureaucratic institutions. The findings suggest that bureaucratic autonomy is a multifaceted concept that varies significantly across different administrative systems, and that understanding these variations is crucial for advancing the field of comparative politics and administrative law."}
