{"Abstract": "This study examines the policy causes and consequences of citizenship and naturalization in Western Europe, focusing on the impact of immigration and integration policies. By analyzing legislative changes and their effects on immigrant populations, the research highlights the complex interplay between state policies and societal integration. The findings suggest that more inclusive naturalization policies correlate with higher levels of social and economic integration, while restrictive policies can lead to social fragmentation and marginalization. The study underscores the importance of balanced and adaptive citizenship policies in fostering cohesive and inclusive societies."}
