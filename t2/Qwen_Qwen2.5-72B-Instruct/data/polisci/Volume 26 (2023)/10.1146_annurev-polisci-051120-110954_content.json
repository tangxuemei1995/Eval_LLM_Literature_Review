{"Abstract": "This paper explores the intersection of gender and international relations, emphasizing the role of gender and sexuality in shaping political economy and foreign policy. By integrating feminist theories and methodologies, the study examines how gendered norms and structures influence state behavior, international institutions, and global economic dynamics. It highlights the ways in which gendered power relations impact conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and economic development. The research also investigates the underrepresentation of women in leadership positions within international organizations and the implications for policy-making. Through a comparative analysis of case studies from different regions, the paper underscores the importance of gender-sensitive approaches in understanding and addressing global challenges. The findings suggest that incorporating gender perspectives can lead to more inclusive and effective international policies and practices."}
