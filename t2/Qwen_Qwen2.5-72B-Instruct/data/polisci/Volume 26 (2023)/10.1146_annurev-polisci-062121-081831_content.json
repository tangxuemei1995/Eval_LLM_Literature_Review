{"Abstract": "This study examines the role of women in political power structures within developing countries, focusing on the impact of electoral quotas and the broader context of state formation and comparative political development. By analyzing data from a diverse set of nations, the research highlights the varying degrees of gender equality and the mechanisms through which women gain political influence. The findings suggest that while electoral quotas have been effective in increasing women’s representation, the effectiveness of these policies is contingent upon the socio-political context and the extent of intrafamily bargaining power. The study also underscores the importance of institutional frameworks that support women’s participation in decision-making processes, both within the family and in the public sphere. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between gender, politics, and development in the global South."}
