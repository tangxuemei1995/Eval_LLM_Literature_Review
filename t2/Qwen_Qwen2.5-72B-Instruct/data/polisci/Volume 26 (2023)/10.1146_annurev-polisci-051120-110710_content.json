{"Abstract": "This study examines the profound impact of the South on American political development, particularly through the lens of Jim Crow laws, authoritarianism, and white supremacy. The region's unique political culture, characterized by a deep-seated commitment to racial hierarchy, has shaped national policies and political institutions, including the New Deal. By analyzing historical and contemporary data, this research highlights how southern politics have influenced the trajectory of American democracy, often reinforcing authoritarian tendencies and limiting the scope of progressive reforms. The findings underscore the enduring legacy of the South in shaping the political landscape of the United States, with implications for current debates on racial justice and political polarization."}
