{"Abstract": "This paper explores the intersection of political economy and public health, emphasizing the role of political science in understanding and addressing health inequities. By integrating insights from political economy, we examine how political structures, economic policies, and social determinants collectively shape population health outcomes. The analysis highlights the importance of governance, policy-making processes, and the distribution of power in health systems. Case studies from diverse contexts illustrate how political factors influence access to healthcare, resource allocation, and the implementation of health interventions. The paper argues for a more interdisciplinary approach to health research and policy, advocating for the inclusion of political science to achieve more equitable health outcomes."}
