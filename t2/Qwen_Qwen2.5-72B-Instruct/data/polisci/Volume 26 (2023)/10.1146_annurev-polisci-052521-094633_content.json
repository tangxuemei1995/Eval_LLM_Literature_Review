{"Abstract": "This paper examines the evolution of global health governance from the colonial era to the contemporary period, focusing on the shifting political dynamics that have shaped international health policies and institutions. The analysis begins with the imperialist roots of global health initiatives, where colonial powers used health interventions as a tool for control and exploitation. It then transitions to the post-World War II era, often referred to as the 'Golden Age' of international cooperation, marked by the establishment of the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international health organizations. The paper highlights the role of these institutions in setting global health agendas and coordinating responses to health crises. Finally, it explores the current landscape of global health governance, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has exposed the vulnerabilities and political tensions within the system. The paper argues that the effectiveness of global health governance is increasingly contingent on the ability of international organizations to navigate complex political landscapes and foster multilateral cooperation, especially during times of crisis such as the 'Great Lockdown.'"}
