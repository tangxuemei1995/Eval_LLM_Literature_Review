{"Abstract": "This paper explores the historical and contemporary relationship between democracy and the corporation, examining how the principles of republicanism and constitutionalism have shaped corporate governance and societal structures. By analyzing the long-term evolution of corporate forms, the study highlights the tension between democratic ideals and the concentration of economic power within corporations. It argues that the rise of enterprise foundations and other corporate governance innovations can serve as mechanisms to mitigate inequality and enhance democratic participation. Through a comparative analysis of different national contexts, the paper identifies key factors that influence the alignment of corporate practices with democratic values, suggesting that a more integrated approach to constitutionalism and corporate governance is essential for fostering a more equitable and participatory economic system."}
