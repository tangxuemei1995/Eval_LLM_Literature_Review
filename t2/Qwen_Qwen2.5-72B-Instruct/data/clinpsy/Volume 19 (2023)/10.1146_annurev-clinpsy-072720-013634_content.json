{"Abstract": "This study examines the developmental consequences of intimate partner violence (IPV) on children, focusing on the impact of prenatal stress and attachment patterns. A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals that exposure to IPV, particularly during the prenatal period, can lead to adverse outcomes in cognitive, emotional, and social development. Children exposed to IPV are at higher risk for developing insecure attachment styles, which can affect their relationships and mental health throughout life. The findings highlight the critical role of early intervention and support for families experiencing IPV to mitigate these negative effects. Implications for clinical practice and policy are discussed, emphasizing the need for a multidisciplinary approach to address the complex needs of these children and their families."}
