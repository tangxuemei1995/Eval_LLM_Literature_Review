{"Abstract": "The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act, enacted in 2004, represents a significant federal initiative aimed at reducing youth suicide through comprehensive prevention programs. This review examines the Act’s core components, including grant programs for states, tribes, and colleges, and its emphasis on early intervention and community-based strategies. Evaluations of the initiative have shown promising outcomes, such as increased awareness of suicide risk factors, improved access to mental health services, and reductions in suicidal ideation and attempts among targeted youth populations. However, challenges remain, including the need for sustained funding, enhanced data collection, and the integration of evidence-based practices. This paper provides an overview of the Act’s implementation, key findings from evaluations, and recommendations for future enhancements to further strengthen youth suicide prevention efforts."}
