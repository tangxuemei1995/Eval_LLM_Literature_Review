{"Abstract": "This paper explores the integration of evidence-based practices (EBPs) with culturally adapted, or 'alter-Native psy-ence,' approaches in community mental health services for American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). Postcolonial anomie, characterized by social dislocation and cultural disruption, exacerbates mental health disparities among AI/AN populations. While EBPs offer standardized, empirically validated interventions, they often fail to address the unique cultural and historical contexts of AI/AN communities. Indigenized therapies, which incorporate traditional healing practices and cultural values, have shown promise in enhancing treatment engagement and outcomes. This review synthesizes the literature on the effectiveness of combining EBPs with alter-Native psy-ence, highlighting the importance of community-based participatory research and culturally responsive care. The findings suggest that a hybrid approach, which respects and integrates Indigenous knowledge systems, can better address the mental health needs of AI/AN communities, fostering resilience and healing."}
