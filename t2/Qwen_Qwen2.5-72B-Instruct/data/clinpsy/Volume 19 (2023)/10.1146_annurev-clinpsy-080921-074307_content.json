{"Abstract": "Tic disorders, including Tourette disorder, significantly impact the quality of life for both children and adults. This review examines the efficacy of behavioral interventions, particularly habit reversal training (HRT) and comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics (CBIT), in managing tic symptoms. HRT and CBIT have been shown to reduce tic frequency and severity through techniques such as awareness training, competing response training, and exposure. Recent studies highlight the long-term benefits of these interventions, with sustained improvements observed up to one year post-treatment. Additionally, the integration of exposure therapy has further enhanced outcomes by addressing the anxiety and stress that often accompany tic disorders. These findings underscore the importance of behavioral interventions as a first-line treatment for tic disorders, offering a non-pharmacological alternative with minimal side effects."}
