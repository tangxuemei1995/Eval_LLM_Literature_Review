{"Abstract": "This paper critically examines the practice of partialing out variables to refine scores and inferences about measures of psychological constructs. Despite its widespread use, this technique can lead to questionable measurement practices that undermine construct validity. By focusing on residualized variables, researchers may inadvertently remove meaningful variance, leading to distorted interpretations of the construct. The paper reviews the theoretical and methodological issues associated with partialing, including the potential for over-controlling and the misinterpretation of semipartial effects. Through empirical examples, we demonstrate how partialing can obscure the true nature of psychological constructs and offer alternative approaches that maintain the integrity of the construct while still addressing confounding variables. The implications for statistical control in psychological research are discussed, emphasizing the need for a more nuanced and cautious approach to measurement and inference."}
