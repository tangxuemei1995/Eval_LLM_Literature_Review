{"Abstract": "This study explores the prevalence and psychological underpinnings of supernatural attributions, focusing on how individuals perceive God, the Devil, demons, spirits, fate, and karma as causes of significant life events. Drawing from a diverse sample of participants, the research employs both quantitative and qualitative methods to examine the relationship between supernatural beliefs, paranormal experiences, and spiritual struggles. Findings indicate that individuals with higher levels of religious involvement and those who have experienced anomalous phenomena are more likely to attribute events to supernatural causes. The study also highlights the role of cognitive and emotional factors in shaping these attributions, suggesting that spiritual experiences and personal crises can intensify the tendency to seek supernatural explanations. Implications for understanding the psychological mechanisms underlying supernatural beliefs and their impact on mental health and well-being are discussed."}
