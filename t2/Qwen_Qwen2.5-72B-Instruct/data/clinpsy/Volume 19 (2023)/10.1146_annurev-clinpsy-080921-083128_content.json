{"Abstract": "Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) has emerged as a robust method for capturing real-time data in natural settings, offering insights into the dynamics of behavior and experience. However, several pressing issues challenge its widespread application and interpretability. This review evaluates key concerns, including content validity, the establishment of gold standards, participant training, data missingness, reliability, and selection bias. The lack of standardized training protocols can lead to inconsistencies in data collection, while missing data can introduce bias and reduce the reliability of findings. Moreover, the absence of clear comparison standards complicates the validation of EMA measures. This paper synthesizes current literature to highlight these issues and proposes strategies to enhance the methodological rigor of EMA studies, ensuring more accurate and generalizable results."}
