{"Abstract": "This study explores the complex relationship between acculturation and psychopathology among immigrants and refugees, distinguishing between proximal and remote acculturation processes. Proximal acculturation, involving direct interactions with the host culture, is associated with increased stress and anxiety, while remote acculturation, characterized by indirect exposure through media and technology, may offer protective factors. Developmental psychopathology frameworks are applied to understand how these processes interact with individual resilience and vulnerability. The findings suggest that while globalization facilitates remote acculturation, it also exacerbates the psychological challenges faced by newcomers. Implications for mental health interventions and policy are discussed, emphasizing the need for culturally sensitive support systems that address both the immediate and long-term impacts of acculturation."}
