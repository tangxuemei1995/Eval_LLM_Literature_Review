{"Abstract": "Culturally Responsive Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CR-CBT) is an emerging approach designed to address mental health disparities among ethnically diverse populations. This paper reviews the current literature on CR-CBT, highlighting the importance of cultural adaptation and clinician training in enhancing therapeutic outcomes. Studies indicate that culturally tailored interventions can improve engagement, reduce dropout rates, and increase the efficacy of CBT in minority groups. Key components of CR-CBT include the integration of cultural values, beliefs, and communication styles into the therapeutic process. Clinician training in cultural competence is essential for effective implementation, as it equips therapists with the skills to navigate cultural nuances and build trust with clients. Future research should focus on developing standardized training programs and conducting large-scale randomized controlled trials to further validate the effectiveness of CR-CBT in diverse settings."}
