{"Abstract": "This study examines the role of racial, ethnic, and cultural resilience factors in the mental health of African American youth. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature, the research highlights the protective effects of racial identity, ethnic-racial socialization, religiosity, spirituality, and positive family dynamics. Findings indicate that these factors mitigate the adverse impacts of racism and discrimination, fostering psychological well-being and resilience. The study underscores the importance of culturally informed interventions that support these protective mechanisms, particularly in parenting practices and community-based programs. Implications for mental health professionals and policymakers are discussed, emphasizing the need for culturally sensitive approaches to address the unique challenges faced by African American youth."}
