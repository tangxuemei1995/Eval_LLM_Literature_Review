{"Abstract": "Eating disorders (EDs) are often perceived as predominantly affecting females; however, recent epidemiological studies highlight a significant and growing prevalence among boys and men. This review synthesizes current literature on the epidemiology, intervention strategies, and outcomes of EDs in male populations. Data indicate that while the incidence is lower compared to females, the severity and comorbidity rates are comparable. Key risk factors include body image dissatisfaction, social pressures, and mental health issues. Interventions tailored to male-specific concerns, such as muscle dysmorphia, have shown promising outcomes, emphasizing the need for gender-sensitive approaches in treatment. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies to better understand the long-term outcomes and to develop more effective, targeted interventions for boys and men with EDs."}
