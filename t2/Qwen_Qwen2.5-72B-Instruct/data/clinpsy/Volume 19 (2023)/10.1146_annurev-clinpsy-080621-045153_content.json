{"Abstract": "Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) is an interdisciplinary field that explores the complex interactions between the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems, and their implications for mental and physical health. This review introduces the mechanisms of immune-to-brain communication, focusing on how psychosocial stress and inflammation can influence neurobiological processes and contribute to the development of mood disorders, particularly depression. Sickness behavior, a constellation of symptoms including fatigue, anhedonia, and social withdrawal, is discussed as a model for understanding the bidirectional relationship between immune activation and psychological distress. The translational potential of PNI research is highlighted, emphasizing the importance of integrating immune markers into clinical assessments and therapeutic interventions to improve patient outcomes. This overview underscores the need for a more holistic approach to mental health, recognizing the critical role of immune function in psychological well-being."}
