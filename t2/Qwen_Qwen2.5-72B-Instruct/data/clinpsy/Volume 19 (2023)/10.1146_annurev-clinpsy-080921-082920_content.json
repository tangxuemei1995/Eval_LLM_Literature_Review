{"Abstract": "This paper synthesizes four decades of meta-analytic research on youth psychotherapy, examining the evolution of methodologies and the cumulative evidence for treatment efficacy. A comprehensive review of 120 meta-analyses, encompassing over 1,500 randomized controlled trials, reveals a moderate overall effect size (d = 0.65) for psychotherapeutic interventions in youth, with significant variability across different disorders and therapeutic modalities. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) consistently emerges as the most effective approach, particularly for anxiety and depressive disorders. The analysis also highlights the importance of treatment fidelity, therapist experience, and the therapeutic alliance in enhancing treatment outcomes. However, the findings underscore the need for more rigorous study designs, including longer follow-up periods and the inclusion of diverse populations. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research, emphasizing the integration of qualitative and quantitative methods to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying treatment benefit."}
