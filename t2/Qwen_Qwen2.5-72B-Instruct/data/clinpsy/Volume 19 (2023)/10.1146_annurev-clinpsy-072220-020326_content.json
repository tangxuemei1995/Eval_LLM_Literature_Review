{"Abstract": "This study examines the mental health challenges faced by transgender and gender diverse (TGD) youth, a population disproportionately affected by psychological distress, including depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature, the study highlights the critical role of social support, family acceptance, and access to gender-affirming care in mitigating these risks. Data from multiple longitudinal studies and surveys indicate that TGD youth who experience supportive environments exhibit significantly better mental health outcomes. The findings underscore the need for targeted interventions and policies to improve the well-being of TGD youth."}
