{"Abstract": "This review examines the multifaceted impacts of parental incarceration on children, integrating perspectives from psychology, sociology, and criminology. By employing an intersectional lens, the study highlights how factors such as race, socioeconomic status, and community context intersect to shape the experiences of these children. The review identifies key risk factors, including economic hardship, social stigma, and disrupted family relationships, while also exploring protective factors that foster resilience, such as supportive caregiving and community resources. The paper critically reframes the discourse around children with incarcerated parents, emphasizing the need for holistic, equity-focused interventions that address systemic inequalities and promote social justice. Recommendations for future research and practice are provided, underscoring the importance of collaborative, community-based approaches to support these vulnerable youth."}
