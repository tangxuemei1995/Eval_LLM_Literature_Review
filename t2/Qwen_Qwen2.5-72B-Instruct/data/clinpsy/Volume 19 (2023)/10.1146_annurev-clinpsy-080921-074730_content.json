{"Abstract": "This study explores the complex interplay between racism and social determinants in the development of psychosis. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature, we examine how racial discrimination, neighborhood factors, and structural racism contribute to the onset and progression of psychotic experiences. Our findings indicate that individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionately affected by these social determinants, which can exacerbate psychological stress and increase the risk of early psychosis. The study highlights the critical role of community-level interventions and policy changes to address structural inequalities and mitigate the adverse mental health outcomes associated with racism. By integrating these insights, mental health professionals can develop more culturally sensitive and effective strategies to support at-risk populations."}
