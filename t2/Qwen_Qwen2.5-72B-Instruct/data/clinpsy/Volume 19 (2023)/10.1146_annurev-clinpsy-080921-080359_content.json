{"Abstract": "This review examines the prevalence, mechanisms, and treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) among refugees, a population disproportionately affected by traumatic events. Studies indicate that up to 30% of refugees experience PTSD, often compounded by ongoing stressors such as displacement and socioeconomic instability. The review highlights the role of pre-migration trauma, including war, persecution, and loss, as significant risk factors. Additionally, post-migration factors such as social isolation and cultural dislocation exacerbate symptoms. Mechanisms underlying PTSD in refugees involve neurobiological alterations, cognitive processing, and social determinants. Effective interventions include trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy, pharmacotherapy, and community-based support programs. However, access to these treatments remains limited, particularly in low-resource settings. Future research should focus on culturally adapted interventions and the long-term outcomes of PTSD in refugee populations. This review underscores the need for a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to address the mental health needs of refugees."}
