{"Abstract": "Protoplanetary disks, the birthplaces of planets, are complex environments where chemical processes play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of planetary systems. This study explores the chemical composition and dynamics within protoplanetary disks, focusing on the interplay between gas and dust, and the influence of physical conditions such as temperature and radiation. Using high-resolution spectroscopic observations and advanced chemical models, we investigate the distribution of key molecular species, including H2O, CO, and NH3, which are essential for the formation of planetary cores and atmospheres. Our findings reveal that the chemical gradients within the disk can significantly affect the composition of forming planets, with implications for the habitability of exoplanets. Additionally, we examine the role of photochemistry and grain surface reactions in shaping the chemical landscape of protoplanetary disks. These results provide new insights into the astrochemical processes that govern the early stages of planet formation, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the origins of planetary systems."}
