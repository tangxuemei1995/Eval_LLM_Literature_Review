{"Abstract": "Circumbinary accretion plays a crucial role in the evolution of binary systems, from stellar binaries to massive binary black holes. This review explores the current understanding of circumbinary accretion processes, focusing on the dynamics of accretion disks and their impact on star formation, black hole growth, and the formation of exoplanets. Recent hydrodynamic simulations have provided insights into the complex interactions between the binary components and the surrounding accretion disk, revealing the formation of gaps, spiral arms, and density waves. These features not only influence the mass transfer rates but also affect the orbital evolution of the binary system. In the context of star formation, circumbinary disks are shown to be capable of supporting the formation of protoplanetary disks, which can lead to the development of exoplanets in binary star systems. For supermassive black hole binaries, the accretion process is critical for understanding the growth and coalescence of these massive objects, which are key to the study of gravitational wave astronomy. The review also highlights the observational challenges and recent advances in detecting and characterizing circumbinary accretion disks, emphasizing the interdisciplinary nature of this field, which bridges astrophysics, hydrodynamics, and gravitational wave physics."}
