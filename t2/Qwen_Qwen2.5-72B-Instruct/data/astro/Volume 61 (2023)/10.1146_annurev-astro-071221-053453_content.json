{"Abstract": "The formation of the first stars, known as Population III stars, marks a pivotal epoch in the early Universe, transitioning from a pristine, metal-free environment to one enriched with the products of stellar nucleosynthesis. These stars, formed from primordial gas clouds in the high-redshift Universe, are hypothesized to be massive, with masses ranging from several tens to hundreds of solar masses. Their intense radiation and supernova explosions played a crucial role in reionizing the intergalactic medium and seeding the formation of subsequent stellar populations, including Population II stars, which are observed in the halo of the Milky Way and other galaxies. Galactic archaeology, the study of the oldest and most metal-poor stars, provides valuable insights into the chemical and dynamical properties of these early stellar populations. Observational efforts, such as high-resolution spectroscopy and deep-field surveys, are essential for identifying and characterizing the remnants of the first stars and understanding their impact on the evolution of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the Universe. This review synthesizes recent theoretical models and observational data to elucidate the formation mechanisms, properties, and cosmological significance of the first stars, highlighting the interplay between star formation, galaxy evolution, and the chemical enrichment of the early Universe."}
