{"Abstract": "Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing astronomical time series data, offering a flexible and robust framework for modeling complex and non-linear relationships. This study explores the application of GPR in time-domain astronomy, focusing on its ability to handle irregularly sampled data, which is common in astronomical observations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GPR in various scenarios, including the detection of periodic signals in variable stars, the characterization of transient events such as supernovae, and the modeling of long-term trends in exoplanet transit data. The computational methods employed in this research, including efficient kernel selection and hyperparameter optimization, are discussed in detail. We also compare GPR with traditional time-series analysis techniques, such as Lomb-Scargle periodograms and autoregressive models, highlighting the advantages of GPR in terms of accuracy and interpretability. The results of this study underscore the potential of GPR as a key technique in the astrostatistics toolkit, providing astronomers with a versatile method for extracting meaningful insights from time-domain data."}
