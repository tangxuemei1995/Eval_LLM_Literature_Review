{"Abstract": "This study explores the role of interstellar interlopers, particularly comets, in the dynamics and composition of protoplanetary disks. Using high-resolution spectroscopy and numerical simulations, we investigate the impact of these interstellar objects on the chemical and physical evolution of young stellar systems. Our findings suggest that interstellar comets can significantly alter the disk's gas and dust composition, potentially influencing the formation and migration of planets. The implications of these results extend to our understanding of the early Solar System and the potential for similar processes in exoplanetary systems."}
