{"Abstract": "Hydrodynamical simulations have become a cornerstone in the study of galaxy formation and evolution, offering detailed insights into the complex interplay between dark matter, gas, and stellar processes. These simulations have successfully reproduced key observational properties of the galaxy population, such as the luminosity function, stellar mass distribution, and morphological diversity. However, significant challenges remain, particularly in accurately modeling feedback processes from supernovae and active galactic nuclei, which are crucial for regulating star formation and shaping galaxy halos. Additionally, the treatment of gas cooling, metal enrichment, and the cosmic web's influence on galaxy growth continues to pose computational and theoretical hurdles. This review highlights the enduring successes of hydrodynamical simulations in galaxy studies and discusses the outstanding challenges that must be addressed to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of galaxy formation."}
