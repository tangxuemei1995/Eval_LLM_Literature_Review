{"Abstract": "This study explores the mechanisms of galactic dynamos, focusing on the generation and maintenance of large-scale magnetic fields in spiral galaxies, including the Milky Way. By analyzing the magnetic Reynolds number, a critical parameter that determines the efficiency of magnetic field amplification, we investigate how these fields are sustained over cosmic timescales. Utilizing high-resolution simulations and observational data from the circumgalactic medium, we demonstrate that the interplay between differential rotation, turbulence, and inflows plays a crucial role in the dynamo process. Our findings suggest that the magnetic fields in spiral galaxies are not only dynamically significant but also influence the structure and evolution of the circumgalactic medium. This research provides new insights into the complex dynamics of galactic magnetic fields and their impact on galaxy formation and evolution."}
