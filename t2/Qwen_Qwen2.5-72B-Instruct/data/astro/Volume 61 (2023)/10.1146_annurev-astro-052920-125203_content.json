{"Abstract": "The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies, serving as a reservoir of gas that can be accreted or ejected through various physical processes. This review focuses on the key physical processes governing the CGM, including hydrodynamics, plasma physics, and their interplay with the intergalactic medium (IGM). Hydrodynamical simulations reveal that the CGM is a complex, multiphase environment characterized by a range of temperatures and densities, which are influenced by feedback from galactic winds, supernovae, and active galactic nuclei (AGN). These processes can heat the gas, drive outflows, and enrich the CGM with metals, affecting the galaxy's star formation history. Additionally, the CGM is subject to thermal and magnetic instabilities, which can lead to the formation of cold clouds and filaments. Theoretical models and cosmological simulations suggest that the CGM's structure and dynamics are closely tied to the larger-scale cosmic web, with the IGM providing a continuous supply of gas that can be accreted onto galaxies. Understanding these processes is essential for constraining models of galaxy formation and evolution, and for interpreting observations of the CGM in various galactic environments."}
