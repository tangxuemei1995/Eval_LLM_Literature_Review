{"Abstract": "The concept of biased agonism, where a ligand preferentially activates one signaling pathway over another, has gained significant attention in the field of opioid receptor pharmacology. This review highlights recent studies that elucidate the mechanisms of ligand bias at opioid receptors, particularly focusing on the differential activation of G protein and Î²-arrestin pathways. Emerging evidence suggests that biased agonists can offer therapeutic advantages by modulating specific signaling outcomes, potentially reducing side effects associated with traditional opioid analgesics. Through detailed analyses of molecular interactions and signaling cascades, this work provides insights into the design of more effective and safer opioid receptor agonists. The implications of these findings extend beyond pain management, offering a framework for the development of biased agonists in other therapeutic areas."}
