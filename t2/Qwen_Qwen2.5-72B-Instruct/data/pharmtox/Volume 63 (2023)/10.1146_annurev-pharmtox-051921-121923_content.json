{"Abstract": "Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatases (MKPs), a subset of dual specificity protein phosphatases, play a crucial role in regulating the activity of MAPKs, which are central to various cell signaling pathways. Despite their therapeutic potential, MKPs have long been considered undruggable due to the challenges associated with targeting the highly conserved catalytic site of protein tyrosine phosphatases. Recent advances in structural biology and chemical biology have identified novel allosteric sites on MKPs, providing new opportunities for the development of small molecule inhibitors. These inhibitors can modulate MKP activity and, consequently, the MAPK signaling pathways, offering promising therapeutic strategies for diseases such as cancer, inflammation, and neurodegenerative disorders. This review highlights the latest progress in understanding the structure and function of MKPs and discusses the emerging approaches to target these proteins, emphasizing the potential of allosteric modulation as a viable strategy to overcome the undruggability of MKPs."}
