{"Abstract": "Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs), often marketed as 'legal highs' or 'herbal incense,' represent a rapidly evolving class of new psychoactive substances (NPS) that mimic the effects of Î”9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. These compounds, including those found in products like Spice, bind to the endocannabinoid system, particularly the CB1 and CB2 receptors, with varying affinities and potencies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the pharmacological and toxicological profiles of SCs, highlighting their mechanisms of action, metabolic pathways, and the acute and chronic health risks associated with their use. The prevalence of SCs in the context of substance use disorders is discussed, along with the challenges in detecting and regulating these designer drugs. The findings underscore the need for enhanced public health interventions and more robust legislative frameworks to mitigate the adverse impacts of SCs on individual and community health."}
