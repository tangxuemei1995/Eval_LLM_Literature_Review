{"Abstract": "Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cardiac function and has emerged as a promising therapeutic target in cardiovascular disease. This kinase is involved in multiple signaling pathways that contribute to the pathogenesis of heart failure and arrhythmias. Recent studies have highlighted the activation of CaMKII in response to calcium overload, oxidative stress, and ischemia-reperfusion injury, leading to adverse remodeling and electrical instability. Targeting CaMKII with specific inhibitors has shown potential in preclinical models to reduce myocardial damage, improve contractility, and prevent arrhythmias. This review summarizes the current understanding of CaMKII's role in cardiovascular disease and discusses the progress and challenges in developing CaMKII-targeted therapies for clinical application."}
