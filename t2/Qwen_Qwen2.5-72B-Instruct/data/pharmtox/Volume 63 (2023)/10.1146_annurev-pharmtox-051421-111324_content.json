{"Abstract": "The integration of electronic health records (EHRs) with genomics offers a powerful approach to accelerate drug discovery. By leveraging large-scale genomic datasets and EHRs, researchers can identify novel drug targets through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). Mendelian randomization techniques further strengthen causal inference by using genetic variants as instrumental variables. This review highlights recent advancements in combining EHRs and genomics to uncover potential therapeutic targets, emphasizing the importance of rigorous data harmonization and analytical methods. Case studies demonstrate the successful application of these integrated approaches in identifying new targets for cardiovascular diseases, psychiatric disorders, and cancer. The synergy between EHRs and genomics not only enhances the efficiency of drug discovery but also paves the way for personalized medicine, ultimately improving patient outcomes."}
