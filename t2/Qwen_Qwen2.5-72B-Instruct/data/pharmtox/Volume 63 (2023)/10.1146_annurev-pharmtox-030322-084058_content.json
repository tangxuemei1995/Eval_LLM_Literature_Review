{"Abstract": "This review explores the role of organic anion transporters (OAT1, OAT3), organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP1B1, OATP1B3), and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRP2, MRP4) in the context of the Remote Sensing and Signaling (RSS) theory. These transporters, encoded by the SLC22A6, SLC22A8, SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, ABCC2, and ABCC4 genes, are critical for the renal and hepatic clearance of endogenous and exogenous compounds. The RSS theory posits that these transporters not only facilitate the elimination of toxins but also act as sensors that modulate systemic homeostasis and inter-organ communication. Emerging evidence suggests that OAT, OATP, and MRP transporters can influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs, thereby affecting therapeutic outcomes and toxicity. Additionally, the interplay between these transporters and other regulatory pathways, such as those involving the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2), highlights the complexity of their roles in maintaining physiological balance. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms and physiological implications of these transporters, providing insights into their potential as therapeutic targets and biomarkers."}
