{"Abstract": "Pharmacogenetics plays a crucial role in optimizing antiplatelet therapy, particularly in the context of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Variants in the CYP2C19 gene, a key enzyme in the metabolism of prodrugs like clopidogrel, significantly influence therapeutic outcomes and the risk of adverse events. This review synthesizes current evidence on the pharmacogenomics of antiplatelet agents, highlighting the clinical utility of CYP2C19 genotyping to guide personalized treatment strategies. Studies have demonstrated that CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles are associated with reduced drug efficacy and increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. Precision medicine approaches, including genotype-guided dosing and alternative antiplatelet agents, have shown promise in improving outcomes and reducing complications. Future research should focus on validating these findings in diverse populations and integrating pharmacogenetic testing into routine clinical practice to enhance the safety and efficacy of antiplatelet therapy."}
