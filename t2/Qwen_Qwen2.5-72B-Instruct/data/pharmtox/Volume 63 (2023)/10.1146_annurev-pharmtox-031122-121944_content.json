{"Abstract": "The G proteinâ€“coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) has emerged as a key player in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer, cardiovascular health, endocrine function, immune responses, and metabolism. This receptor, distinct from classical nuclear estrogen receptors, mediates rapid, non-genomic effects of estrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying GPER activation and signaling, revealing its involvement in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation. In cancer, GPER is implicated in the progression and therapeutic resistance of breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers. In cardiovascular disease, GPER activation can exert protective effects, while in metabolic disorders, it modulates insulin sensitivity and adipogenesis. This review summarizes the current understanding of GPER's molecular pharmacology and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for a range of diseases, emphasizing the need for selective GPER agonists and antagonists to harness its therapeutic benefits while minimizing side effects."}
