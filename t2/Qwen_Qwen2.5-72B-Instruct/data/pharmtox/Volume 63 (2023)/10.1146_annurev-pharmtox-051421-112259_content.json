{"Abstract": "Neuropathic pain, a debilitating condition affecting millions globally, arises from nerve damage and involves complex interactions between immune cells and neurons. This review highlights the mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain, emphasizing sex differences and similarities. Studies indicate that while both males and females exhibit pain hypersensitivity, the underlying mechanisms differ. In males, microglial activation plays a pivotal role, whereas in females, T cells and B cells are more prominently involved. These sex-specific differences in immune cell activation suggest the need for tailored therapeutic approaches. Additionally, recent research has identified potential therapeutic targets, including modulators of ion channels, cytokines, and neurotrophic factors. Understanding these mechanisms and sex differences is crucial for developing more effective and personalized treatments for neuropathic pain."}
