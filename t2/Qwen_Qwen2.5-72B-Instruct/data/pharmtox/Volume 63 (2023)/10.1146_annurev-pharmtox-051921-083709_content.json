{"Abstract": "This paper provides a comprehensive autobiographical journey through the intricate world of cannabinoid and endocannabinoid chemistry and pharmacology. It delves into the discovery and synthesis of key compounds such as anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), which are pivotal endocannabinoids, alongside the well-known phytocannabinoids tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). The narrative explores the historical context, molecular structures, and biological activities of these compounds, highlighting their roles in various physiological processes. Additionally, the paper discusses the emerging field of endocannabinoid-like compounds, which exhibit similar pharmacological effects but differ in structure. The author reflects on personal experiences and significant milestones in the field, offering insights into the challenges and breakthroughs that have shaped the current understanding of the endocannabinoid system. This account aims to provide a rich, detailed perspective on the evolution of cannabinoid research and its potential therapeutic applications."}
