{"Abstract": "This review explores the pharmacological strategies aimed at inducing cell death in granulocytes, including neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, as a therapeutic approach for treating inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Granulocytes play a critical role in innate immunity but can contribute to tissue damage and chronic inflammation when their activity is dysregulated. The mechanisms of apoptosis, necroptosis, and autophagy in granulocytes are discussed, highlighting the specific pathways that can be targeted to promote cell death. Recent studies have identified several compounds, such as glucocorticoids, anthracyclines, and BH3 mimetics, that effectively induce apoptosis in granulocytes without significantly affecting lymphocytes. These findings suggest that pharmacological induction of granulocyte cell death could be a promising therapeutic strategy to reduce inflammation and prevent tissue damage in conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and rheumatoid arthritis. Further research is needed to optimize these compounds and to evaluate their safety and efficacy in clinical settings."}
