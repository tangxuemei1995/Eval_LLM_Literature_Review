{"Abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in the drug discovery process has revolutionized lead-to-candidate decision-making. This review highlights the advancements in AI and ML techniques that enhance decision quality, from initial hit identification to the optimization of lead compounds. Computational toxicology, a critical component in this pipeline, leverages these technologies to predict adverse effects and improve the safety profile of drug candidates. Case studies demonstrate the efficacy of AI-driven models in reducing time and costs associated with traditional methods. The discussion also explores the challenges and future directions, emphasizing the need for robust data integration and interdisciplinary collaboration to fully realize the potential of AI in drug discovery. This work underscores the transformative impact of AI and ML on the pharmaceutical industry, paving the way for more efficient and effective drug development processes."}
