{"Abstract": "Lysosomal ion channels, including transient receptor potential mucolipin (TRPMLs), two-pore channels (TPCs), and transmembrane protein 175 (TMEM175), play crucial roles in lysosomal function and cellular homeostasis. These channels regulate lysosomal pH, calcium signaling, and autophagy, which are essential for various physiological processes. Dysregulation of these channels has been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and mucolipidosis. Recent advances in structural biology and functional studies have provided insights into the mechanisms of these channels and their potential as therapeutic targets. This review summarizes the current understanding of lysosomal ion channels, their physiological functions, and the implications of their dysfunction in disease. Additionally, we discuss the emerging evidence supporting the druggability of these channels, highlighting the potential for developing novel therapeutic strategies to modulate lysosomal function and treat neurodegenerative conditions."}
