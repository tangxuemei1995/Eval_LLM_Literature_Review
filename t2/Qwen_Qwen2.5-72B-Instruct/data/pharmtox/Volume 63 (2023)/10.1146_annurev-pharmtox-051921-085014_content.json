{"Abstract": "Leukotrienes, derived from arachidonic acid, play a pivotal role in mediating inflammatory responses and are implicated in various endemic diseases. This review highlights recent advances in the structural characterization of key leukotriene biosynthetic enzymes, including 5-lipoxygenase and leukotriene A4 hydrolase. These structural insights have facilitated the development of novel therapeutics through structure-based drug design, aiming to modulate enzyme activity and reduce leukotriene production. Emerging inhibitors show promising efficacy in preclinical models, suggesting potential for treating inflammatory conditions. The integration of structural biology with medicinal chemistry offers a robust framework for the discovery of next-generation anti-inflammatory drugs."}
