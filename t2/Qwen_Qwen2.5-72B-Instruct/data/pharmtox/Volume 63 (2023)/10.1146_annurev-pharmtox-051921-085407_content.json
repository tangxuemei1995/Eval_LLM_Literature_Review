{"Abstract": "Lipoxins, endogenous lipid mediators, play a pivotal role in the resolution of inflammation by promoting anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving signals. This study investigates the efficacy of two novel lipoxin mimetics, AT-01-KG and AT-02-CT, in modulating inflammatory responses and preventing fibrosis. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrate that both compounds significantly reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine production and enhance the expression of resolution-phase mediators. AT-01-KG and AT-02-CT effectively attenuate fibrotic changes in lung and liver tissues, highlighting their potential as therapeutic agents. These findings underscore the importance of lipoxin mimetics in promoting the resolution of inflammation and suggest their utility in treating chronic inflammatory and fibrotic diseases."}
