{"Abstract": "The resolution of inflammation is a critical process that prevents chronic inflammation and tissue damage. This review focuses on the therapeutic potential of annexin A1 (AnxA1) and specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) in promoting the resolution of inflammation. AnxA1, a protein with potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving properties, and its derived peptides have shown promise in modulating immune responses and facilitating tissue repair. SPMs, including resolvins, protectins, and maresins, are endogenous lipid mediators that actively resolve inflammation by promoting macrophage polarization, enhancing bacterial clearance, and reducing cytokine production. Recent studies highlight the synergistic effects of AnxA1 and SPMs in various inflammatory conditions, suggesting their combined use as a novel therapeutic strategy. This review discusses the mechanisms of action, clinical applications, and future directions for the development of AnxA1 peptides and SPMs in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, emphasizing their potential to revolutionize therapeutic approaches in inflammation management."}
