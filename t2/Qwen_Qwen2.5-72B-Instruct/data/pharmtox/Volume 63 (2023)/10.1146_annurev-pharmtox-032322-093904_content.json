{"Abstract": "Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) have emerged as promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity-related metabolic complications. This review summarizes recent advances in FGF-based pharmacotherapies, including recombinant proteins and agonistic antibodies, which have shown significant potential in modulating metabolic pathways. Studies have demonstrated that FGF19 and FGF21 analogs can improve insulin sensitivity, reduce hepatic steatosis, and lower systemic inflammation in preclinical models of obesity. Agonistic antibodies targeting FGF receptors have also been developed, offering a novel approach to enhance FGF signaling without the systemic side effects associated with traditional protein therapeutics. Clinical trials are underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these agents in human subjects, with preliminary results indicating a favorable risk-benefit profile. The integration of FGF-based therapies into the clinical management of obesity and its metabolic sequelae represents a promising avenue for improving patient outcomes."}
