{"Abstract": "Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn-3 PUFAs), primarily eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been extensively studied for their potential benefits in cardiovascular health. These fatty acids, commonly sourced from fish oil, have been shown to reduce triglyceride levels, lower blood pressure, and decrease the risk of arrhythmias. However, the evidence regarding their impact on major cardiovascular events remains mixed. Some studies suggest that LCn-3 PUFAs can reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke, while others indicate no significant benefit. Potential drawbacks include increased bleeding risk and interactions with anticoagulant medications. This review synthesizes current research to provide a balanced perspective on the pros and cons of LCn-3 PUFAs in cardiovascular health, highlighting the need for personalized approaches based on individual risk factors and medical history."}
