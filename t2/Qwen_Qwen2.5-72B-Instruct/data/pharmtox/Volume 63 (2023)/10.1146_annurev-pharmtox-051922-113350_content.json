{"Abstract": "This review synthesizes current knowledge on the chemical exposome during fetal development and early childhood, emphasizing the role of human biomonitoring in assessing prenatal and postnatal exposures. The exposome encompasses a wide array of xenobiotics and natural contaminants, which can cross the placental barrier and impact fetal development. Studies utilizing advanced biomonitoring techniques have identified numerous environmental chemicals, including endocrine disruptors, heavy metals, and persistent organic pollutants, in maternal and neonatal samples. The placenta, while providing a degree of protection, is not impermeable, and its role in modulating the transfer of these substances is a critical area of investigation. Early life exposure to these chemicals has been linked to adverse health outcomes, including neurodevelopmental disorders, immune dysregulation, and metabolic disturbances. This review highlights the need for comprehensive, longitudinal studies to better understand the long-term health implications of the chemical exposome and to inform public health policies aimed at reducing exposure risks."}
