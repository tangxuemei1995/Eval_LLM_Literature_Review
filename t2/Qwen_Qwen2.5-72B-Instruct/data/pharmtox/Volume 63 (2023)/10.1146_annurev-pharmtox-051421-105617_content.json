{"Abstract": "Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have emerged as a powerful and scalable in vivo model for systems pharmacology and toxicology due to their genetic similarity to humans, rapid development, and cost-effectiveness. This review highlights the utility of zebrafish in elucidating the mechanisms of drug action and toxicity, facilitating high-throughput screening, and providing insights into complex biological processes. Recent advancements in genetic manipulation and imaging technologies have further enhanced the applicability of zebrafish for studying drug metabolism, transport, and target engagement. Additionally, zebrafish offer a valuable alternative to traditional mammalian models, reducing the need for higher vertebrates in preclinical research. This paper discusses key studies that demonstrate the translational potential of zebrafish, emphasizing their role in advancing drug discovery and safety assessment."}
