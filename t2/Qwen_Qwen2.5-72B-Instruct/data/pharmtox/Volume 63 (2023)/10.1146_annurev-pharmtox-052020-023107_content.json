{"Abstract": "Aspirin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), has been extensively studied for its potential role in cancer chemoprevention. Recent pharmacological developments have elucidated the mechanisms by which aspirin exerts its anti-cancer effects, primarily through the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which are responsible for the production of prostaglandins, thromboxane, and prostacyclin. These eicosanoids play critical roles in inflammation, angiogenesis, and cell proliferation, processes that are often dysregulated in cancer. Emerging evidence suggests that aspirin's chemopreventive benefits may extend to various cancer types, including colorectal, breast, and lung cancer. However, the optimal dose and duration of aspirin use for cancer prevention remain subjects of ongoing investigation. This review summarizes the latest findings on the molecular mechanisms of aspirin's chemopreventive actions and discusses the potential clinical implications, emphasizing the balance between the benefits and risks of long-term aspirin use."}
