{"Abstract": "Age-related perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNDs), including postoperative delirium, pose significant challenges to perioperative brain health. This review examines experimental models and potential druggable targets to mitigate PNDs. Animal models, such as aged rodents subjected to surgical stress, have elucidated the role of neuroinflammation in cognitive decline. Key pathways, including the activation of microglia and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, are identified as critical mediators. Clinical studies support these findings, highlighting the importance of comprehensive cognitive assessment and the development of care pathways to optimize perioperative management. Emerging therapeutic strategies targeting neuroinflammation, such as selective inhibitors of microglial activation, show promise in reducing the incidence and severity of PNDs. This integrative approach aims to enhance perioperative brain health and improve patient outcomes."}
