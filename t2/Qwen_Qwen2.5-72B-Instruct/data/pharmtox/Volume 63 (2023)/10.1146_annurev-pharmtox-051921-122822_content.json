{"Abstract": "Pharmacological interventions play a critical role in managing complications during labor and delivery, including dystocia, preterm delivery, and postpartum hemorrhage. This review examines the efficacy and safety of various drugs that target the myometrium to modulate uterine contractions. Oxytocin, prostaglandins, and beta-adrenergic agonists are commonly used to induce or augment labor, while magnesium sulfate and calcium channel blockers are employed to delay preterm labor. Postpartum hemorrhage management often involves the use of uterotonic agents such as carboprost and misoprostol. The review highlights the mechanisms of action, dosing regimens, and potential side effects of these drugs, emphasizing the importance of individualized treatment plans to optimize maternal and neonatal outcomes. Clinical guidelines and recent advances in pharmacotherapy are discussed to provide a comprehensive overview for obstetricians and healthcare providers."}
