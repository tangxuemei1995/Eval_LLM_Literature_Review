{"Abstract": "Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder characterized by significant cognitive impairments, which often precede and persist beyond the onset of psychotic symptoms. These cognitive deficits, encompassing domains such as attention, memory, and executive function, are increasingly recognized as core features of the illness and major contributors to functional disability. Recent advances in neurobiology have highlighted the role of glutamatergic and dopaminergic systems in the pathophysiology of these cognitive deficits. Specifically, dysregulation of NMDA receptors and altered dopamine signaling in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus are implicated in the disrupted neural processing observed in schizophrenia. Electrophysiological measures, such as mismatch negativity, have provided insights into early sensory processing deficits, further supporting the involvement of glutamate and dopamine in cognitive dysfunction. Current treatment strategies, including atypical antipsychotics and cognitive remediation therapies, aim to address these deficits, but more targeted interventions are needed. Emerging pharmacological approaches, such as NMDA receptor modulators and dopamine D2 receptor agonists, show promise in improving cognitive outcomes. This review synthesizes the current understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and discusses potential therapeutic avenues."}
