{"Abstract": "Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, initially developed for erectile dysfunction, have emerged as promising therapeutic agents for a wide array of clinical disorders. This review highlights the multifaceted roles of PDE5 inhibitors in treating conditions characterized by endothelial dysfunction, such as cardiovascular diseases, where they exhibit cardioprotective effects by enhancing nitric oxide signaling and improving vascular function. Additionally, these inhibitors have shown potential in managing metabolic disorders, including diabetes and obesity, by modulating glucose metabolism and reducing insulin resistance. Emerging evidence also suggests their beneficial effects in mitigating age-related decline and their potential as adjunctive therapy in cancer, where they can enhance the efficacy of existing treatments and reduce tumor progression. This comprehensive overview underscores the broad therapeutic potential of PDE5 inhibitors beyond their traditional use, opening new avenues for their application in clinical practice."}
