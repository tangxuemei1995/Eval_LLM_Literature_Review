{"Abstract": "This review examines the impact of air pollution, particularly ultrafine particles and PM2.5, on neurotoxicity across the life span. Emerging evidence suggests that chronic exposure to these pollutants disrupts brain metal dyshomeostasis, contributing to the development of neurodevelopmental disorders in children and neurodegenerative diseases in adults. Mechanistic studies highlight the role of oxidative stress and inflammation in mediating these effects. The review also discusses the implications for public health and the need for targeted interventions to mitigate the adverse neurological outcomes associated with air pollution exposure."}
