{"Abstract": "Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), derived from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, have emerged as key regulators in the resolution of inflammation and pain. This review highlights the role of SPMs, including neuroprotectin D1 and resolvins, in modulating nociceptive sensory neurons and their interactions with transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. These mediators exhibit neuroimmune modulatory properties, attenuating pain and itch by influencing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and modulating the activity of sensory neurons. Preclinical studies demonstrate that SPMs can reduce hyperalgesia and pruritus, suggesting their potential as novel therapeutic agents in resolution pharmacology. The mechanisms underlying these effects, including the activation of specific receptors and signaling pathways, are discussed, providing a foundation for the development of SPM-based therapies for chronic pain and itch management."}
