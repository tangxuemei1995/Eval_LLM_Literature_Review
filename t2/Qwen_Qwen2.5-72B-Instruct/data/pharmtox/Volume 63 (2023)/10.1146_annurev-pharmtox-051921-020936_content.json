{"Abstract": "Arsenic, a ubiquitous environmental contaminant, exhibits a complex metabolism in humans, significantly influencing its toxicity and health impacts. This review explores the dual nature of arsenic metabolism, focusing on the processes of methylation and speciation. Methylation, a key detoxification pathway, converts inorganic arsenic into organic forms, which are generally less toxic. However, this process also generates intermediate metabolites that can be more toxic than the parent compound. The efficiency of methylation varies among individuals, affecting susceptibility to arsenic-induced diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and neurological impairments. Understanding the mechanisms of arsenic metabolism is crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate its health risks. This review synthesizes current knowledge on arsenic metabolism and its implications for human health, highlighting the need for personalized approaches in risk assessment and intervention."}
