{"Abstract": "This review focuses on the development of personalized therapeutics for KATP-dependent pathologies, emphasizing the roles of Kir6.2, Kir6.1, SUR1, and SUR2 subunits. Congenital hyperinsulinism, neonatal diabetes, and Cant√∫ syndrome are highlighted as key conditions where mutations in these subunits lead to dysregulated ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel function. Recent advances in genetic screening and pharmacological interventions are discussed, including the use of sulfonylureas and KATP channel openers. The review also explores the potential of gene therapy and precision medicine approaches to tailor treatments to individual genetic profiles, aiming to improve clinical outcomes and reduce side effects. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders is crucial for developing effective, patient-specific therapeutic strategies."}
