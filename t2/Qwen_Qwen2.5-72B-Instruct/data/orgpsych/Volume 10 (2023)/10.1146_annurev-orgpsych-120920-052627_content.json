{"Abstract": "This review examines the extent to which organizational justice mechanisms are colorblind in the context of workplace racioethnic differences. By synthesizing findings from 45 empirical studies, the paper highlights significant disparities in perceptions of distributive, procedural, and interactional justice among racial and ethnic groups. The analysis reveals that minority employees often report lower levels of organizational justice, which is associated with higher levels of perceived discrimination and reduced job satisfaction. The review also discusses the role of organizational policies and leadership in mitigating these disparities, suggesting that explicit anti-discrimination measures and inclusive practices can enhance perceptions of fairness. Implications for future research and practical recommendations for organizations are provided to foster more equitable workplaces."}
