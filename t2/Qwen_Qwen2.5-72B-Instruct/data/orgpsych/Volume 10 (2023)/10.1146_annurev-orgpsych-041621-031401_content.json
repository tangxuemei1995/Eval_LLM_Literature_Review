{"Abstract": "This paper reviews the current state of structural equation modeling (SEM) in organizational research, highlighting its role in advancing our understanding of complex relationships among latent variables. We examine the prevalence and quality of SEM applications, focusing on issues such as model fit, latent interactions, and the integration of longitudinal data. Despite its widespread use, challenges remain, including the need for more rigorous model testing and the incorporation of advanced techniques to address non-linear relationships. We propose several strategies to enhance the robustness and validity of SEM in future research, such as the adoption of Bayesian methods and the development of more sophisticated measurement models. These recommendations aim to ensure that SEM continues to serve as a powerful tool for advancing organizational science."}
