{"Abstract": "This review revisits the Job Demandsâ€“Resources (JD-R) theory a decade after its initial formulation, synthesizing recent advancements and empirical findings. The JD-R theory posits that job demands and resources are key determinants of burnout and work engagement. Over the past ten years, research has expanded to include a broader range of job demands and resources, as well as their dynamic interplay. Studies have consistently shown that job resources can buffer the negative effects of job demands on burnout and enhance work engagement. Moreover, the role of proactive work behavior in shaping job conditions and outcomes has gained attention. This review highlights the importance of job design in fostering a positive work environment and suggests avenues for future research, including the integration of individual differences and contextual factors."}
