{"Abstract": "This paper revisits the literature on employee voice and silence, providing a comprehensive review a decade after the initial surge of research in this area. We synthesize findings from over 100 studies, highlighting the critical role of upward communication and proactive behavior in organizational settings. The review identifies key antecedents and outcomes of employee voice, such as leadership support, psychological safety, and organizational performance. Conversely, the detrimental effects of employee silence on information sharing and innovation are underscored. The paper also discusses methodological advancements and calls for future research to explore the contextual factors that influence voice and silence, particularly in diverse and dynamic work environments. Practical implications for managers and organizations are outlined, emphasizing the importance of fostering a culture that encourages open communication and active participation."}
