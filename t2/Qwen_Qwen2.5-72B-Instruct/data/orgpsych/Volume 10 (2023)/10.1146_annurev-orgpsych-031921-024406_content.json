{"Abstract": "Self-reflection at work is a critical process that can enhance personal and professional growth, but it must be managed carefully to avoid the pitfalls of rumination. This study explores the mechanisms through which self-reflection can be harnessed to improve leadership, emotion regulation, and overall performance. By adopting a cognitive distancing approach, individuals can gain valuable insights while maintaining a healthy perspective. The findings suggest that structured reflection practices, such as journaling and feedback sessions, can significantly boost self-awareness and decision-making skills. However, excessive rumination without constructive outcomes can lead to decreased productivity and well-being. This research provides practical guidelines for organizations to foster a reflective culture that maximizes the benefits of self-reflection while mitigating its risks."}
