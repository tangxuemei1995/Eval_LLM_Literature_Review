{"Abstract": "This paper aims to advance the Challenge–Hindrance Stressor Framework by integrating recent insights from the Transactional Theory of Stress, Conservation of Resources (COR) theory, and Job Demands–Resources (JD-R) model. We propose a revised framework, Challenge–Hindrance Stressor Framework 2.0, which emphasizes the role of appraisals and the negativity bias in shaping employees' responses to workplace stressors. By distinguishing between challenge stressors, which are perceived as opportunities for growth, and hindrance stressors, which are seen as obstacles to goal attainment, the framework provides a nuanced understanding of how these stressors influence psychological and physiological outcomes. The integration of these theoretical perspectives not only enhances our understanding of the mechanisms underlying stressor–outcome relationships but also offers practical implications for organizational interventions aimed at mitigating the adverse effects of hindrance stressors while leveraging the benefits of challenge stressors."}
