{"Abstract": "This study explores the interplay between decent work and meaningful work, two critical concepts in the psychology of working. Decent work, characterized by fair income, security, and safe working conditions, is often seen as a prerequisite for meaningful work, which encompasses the personal significance and fulfillment individuals derive from their jobs. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, this paper examines how job design and work conditions influence the perception of meaningfulness in the workplace. The findings suggest that while decent work provides the foundational elements necessary for a positive work environment, meaningful work is achieved through a combination of personal values, job autonomy, and social connections at work. The implications of these findings highlight the importance of integrating both decent and meaningful work principles in organizational practices to enhance employee well-being and organizational performance."}
