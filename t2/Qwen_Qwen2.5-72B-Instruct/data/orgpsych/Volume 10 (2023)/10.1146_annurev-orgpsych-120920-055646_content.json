{"Abstract": "This study explores the psychological underpinnings of entrepreneurship, focusing on the interplay between action and process. Utilizing action theory, bricolage, and effectuation, we examine how entrepreneurs' cognitive processes, motivations, and emotions influence their decision-making and resource allocation. The findings reveal that entrepreneurial action is often driven by a combination of opportunity recognition, resource leveraging, and emotional resilience. Entrepreneurs who adopt an effectual logic tend to be more adaptive and resourceful, leveraging available means to pursue opportunities. Moreover, the study highlights the role of positive emotions in sustaining motivation and fostering creative problem-solving. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the psychological mechanisms that underpin successful entrepreneurial ventures."}
