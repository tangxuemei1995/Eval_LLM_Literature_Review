{"Abstract": "This paper synthesizes a century of research on personnel selection to explore how reducing noise—unwanted variance in judgments—can improve workplace decision-making. By examining the sources and impacts of noise in selection processes, we highlight strategies to enhance the reliability and validity of judgments. Key findings include the effectiveness of structured interviews, standardized assessments, and data-driven forecasting methods. These approaches not only minimize noise but also support more strategic and equitable hiring practices. Implications for organizational strategy and future research directions are discussed."}
