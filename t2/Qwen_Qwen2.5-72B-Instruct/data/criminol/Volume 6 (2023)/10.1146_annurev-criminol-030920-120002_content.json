{"Abstract": "This paper explores the intersection of LatCrit (Latino/a/x Critical Race Theory) and criminology to develop a more nuanced understanding of Latino/a/x crime and involvement in the criminal legal system. By integrating critical race theory (CRT) with traditional criminological frameworks, this study aims to address the underrepresentation and misrepresentation of Latino/a/x populations in criminological research. The analysis reveals that structural racism, systemic inequality, and cultural marginalization significantly influence the criminalization of Latino/a/x individuals. The paper critiques existing criminological theories, such as strain theory and social control theory, for their limited consideration of race and ethnicity. Instead, it proposes a LatCrit framework that emphasizes the role of racialized social control, institutional discrimination, and the historical context of Latino/a/x communities. Empirical data from qualitative interviews and quantitative studies are used to illustrate how these factors contribute to higher rates of criminal legal system involvement among Latino/a/x populations. The findings suggest that a LatCrit approach can provide a more comprehensive and culturally sensitive explanation of crime and criminal justice outcomes, ultimately informing more equitable policy and practice. This theoretical integration not only enriches the field of criminology but also highlights the need for further research that centers the experiences of marginalized racial and ethnic groups."}
