{"Abstract": "The opioid crisis has reignited debates about the efficacy and morality of the 'War on Drugs.' This paper examines the historical and contemporary contexts of drug policy, particularly focusing on the racialized nature of drug enforcement and the contrasting responses to the crack epidemic and the current opioid crisis. While the crack epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s was met with harsh punitive measures disproportionately affecting communities of color, the opioid crisis has prompted a more nuanced approach, emphasizing treatment and public health. However, this shift in rhetoric and policy does not fully address the underlying systemic issues that perpetuate drug use and addiction. The paper argues that while the 'War on Drugs' may appear to be evolving, its core elements—criminalization, stigmatization, and racial bias—remain intact. Through a critical analysis of drug treatment programs, policy changes, and their impacts on different communities, this study highlights the need for a comprehensive, equitable, and evidence-based approach to addressing the opioid crisis and the broader issues of drug use in society."}
