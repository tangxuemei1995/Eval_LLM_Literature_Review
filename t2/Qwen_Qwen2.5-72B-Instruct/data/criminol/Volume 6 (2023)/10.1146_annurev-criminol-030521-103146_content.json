{"Abstract": "This review examines the impact of COVID-19 within carceral systems, focusing on the incidence of the virus, mitigation strategies, and vaccination efforts. Prisons and jails have emerged as hotspots for the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 due to overcrowding, limited access to healthcare, and inadequate infection control measures. Studies from various countries highlight the disproportionate burden of the pandemic on incarcerated populations, with infection rates often exceeding those in the general community. Mitigation strategies, including enhanced sanitation, social distancing, and the reduction of inmate populations through early release, have shown mixed results. Vaccination campaigns have been implemented in many facilities, but challenges such as vaccine hesitancy, logistical issues, and the transient nature of jail populations have hindered efforts. This review synthesizes current evidence to inform policy and practice, emphasizing the need for comprehensive, evidence-based approaches to protect the health of incarcerated individuals and the broader community."}
