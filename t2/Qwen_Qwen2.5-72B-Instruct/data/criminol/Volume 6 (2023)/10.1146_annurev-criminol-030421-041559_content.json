{"Abstract": "This study examines the trends in women's incarceration rates in US prisons and jails from 1980 to 2020, highlighting the disproportionate impact on marginalized communities. Using a combination of quantitative data analysis and qualitative case studies, the research reveals a significant increase in the number of women incarcerated, driven by policies that disproportionately affect women of color and those from low-income backgrounds. The findings underscore the role of systemic inequalities in the criminal justice system, including mandatory minimum sentences and the war on drugs. The consequences of this mass incarceration are far-reaching, affecting not only the women themselves but also their families and communities. The study calls for a reevaluation of current policies and the implementation of more equitable practices to address the root causes of crime and reduce the incarceration of women."}
