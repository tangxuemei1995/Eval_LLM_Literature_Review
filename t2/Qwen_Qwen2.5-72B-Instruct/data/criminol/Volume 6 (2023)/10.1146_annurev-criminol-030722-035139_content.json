{"Abstract": "This paper provides a comprehensive structural analysis of the current crisis in the American criminal justice system, focusing on the interrelated issues of mass incarceration, police killings, and criminal violence. By examining the political economy and the role of the welfare state, the study reveals how these factors contribute to the perpetuation of social control mechanisms that disproportionately affect marginalized communities. The analysis highlights the historical and contemporary policies that have led to the overcriminalization of poverty and the racialization of justice. The paper argues that a fundamental restructuring of the criminal justice system is necessary to address these systemic issues, including the reallocation of resources from punitive measures to social welfare programs. This approach aims to reduce the reliance on incarceration and policing as primary methods of social control, thereby fostering a more equitable and just society."}
