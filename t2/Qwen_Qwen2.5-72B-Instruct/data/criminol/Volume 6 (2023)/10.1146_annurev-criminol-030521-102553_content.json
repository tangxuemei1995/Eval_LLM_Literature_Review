{"Abstract": "This study examines the evolution and interplay of far-right and jihadi terrorism within the United States from the pivotal events of September 11th, 2001, to the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, 2021. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of terrorist incidents, the research identifies significant trends in the motivations, tactics, and targets of these extremist groups. The findings reveal a marked increase in far-right extremism, particularly in the form of white supremacist and anti-government ideologies, alongside a persistent threat from jihadi-inspired attacks. The study also highlights the role of social media and online platforms in radicalization and the mobilization of extremist activities. Additionally, the research underscores the growing convergence of far-right and jihadi narratives, which has led to a complex and evolving threat landscape. The implications for counterterrorism policy and the need for a nuanced approach to addressing the root causes of extremism are discussed, emphasizing the importance of community engagement and deradicalization programs."}
