{"Abstract": "This paper explores the evolution of police observational research in the twenty-first century, emphasizing the integration of qualitative methods and systematic social observations. By focusing on procedural justice, the study examines how police interactions are perceived by the public and how these perceptions influence community trust. The research addresses the challenges of reactivity and reflexivity, ensuring that the presence of observers does not unduly influence police behavior. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature, the paper highlights the importance of methodological rigor in observational studies and suggests best practices for future research. The findings underscore the need for a balanced approach that combines observational data with other qualitative and quantitative methods to provide a more nuanced understanding of police-community relations."}
