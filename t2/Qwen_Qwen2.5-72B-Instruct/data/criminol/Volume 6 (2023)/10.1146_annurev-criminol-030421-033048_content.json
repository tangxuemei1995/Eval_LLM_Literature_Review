{"Abstract": "This paper explores the resurgence of ethnographic studies in the field of immigration and crime, drawing on the foundational work of the Chicago School. By employing qualitative methods, contemporary researchers are delving into the complex social dynamics that shape the experiences of new immigrants and their interactions with the criminal justice system. The study highlights how modern ethnographies of migration offer nuanced insights into the structural and cultural factors that influence immigrant involvement in crime, challenging simplistic narratives of immigrant criminality. Through in-depth fieldwork and participant observation, this research not only enriches our understanding of the immigrant experience but also provides critical policy recommendations for more inclusive and effective crime prevention strategies."}
