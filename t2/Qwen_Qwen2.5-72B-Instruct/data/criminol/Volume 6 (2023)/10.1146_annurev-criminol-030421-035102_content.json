{"Abstract": "This paper examines the intersection of surveillance technologies and constitutional law, particularly focusing on the implications for the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches. As technological advancements enable more sophisticated and pervasive forms of surveillance, the legal framework governing these practices is increasingly challenged. The study reviews recent case law and legislative responses to emerging surveillance methods, such as facial recognition, GPS tracking, and data mining. It highlights the tension between the state's interest in crime prevention and the individual's right to privacy. The analysis suggests that current legal interpretations often lag behind technological developments, necessitating a reevaluation of what constitutes a 'search' under the Fourth Amendment. The paper concludes with recommendations for a more adaptive and technology-inclusive approach to constitutional law to better protect individual rights in the digital age."}
