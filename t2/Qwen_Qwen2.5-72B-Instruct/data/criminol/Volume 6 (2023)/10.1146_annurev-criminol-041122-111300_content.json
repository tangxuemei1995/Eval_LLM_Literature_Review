{"Abstract": "This study explores the profound impact of trauma on individuals within the criminal justice system and its implications for successful reentry. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature, the research highlights the prevalence of trauma among incarcerated individuals and its correlation with behavioral health issues and recidivism. The findings underscore the critical need for trauma-informed approaches in correctional settings and reentry programs. Such approaches, which prioritize mental health support and address the root causes of criminal behavior, are shown to significantly reduce recidivism rates and improve long-term outcomes. The study also examines recent policy reforms aimed at integrating trauma-informed practices and discusses the potential benefits and challenges of these initiatives. Ultimately, the research advocates for a more holistic and supportive reentry framework that recognizes and addresses the complex needs of trauma-affected individuals."}
