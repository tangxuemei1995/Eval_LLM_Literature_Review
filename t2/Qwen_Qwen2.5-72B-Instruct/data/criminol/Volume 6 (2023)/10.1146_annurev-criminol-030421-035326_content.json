{"Abstract": "This paper explores the concept of expanded criminal defense lawyering, a holistic approach that goes beyond traditional legal representation to address the multifaceted needs of defendants, particularly those from indigent backgrounds. By integrating social work, mental health services, and community resources, this model aims to provide more effective assistance of counsel, thereby enhancing the right to counsel and reducing the likelihood of mass incarceration. The study reviews existing literature on holistic defense strategies, examines case studies of successful implementation, and identifies key challenges and opportunities for reform. Findings suggest that expanded criminal defense lawyering not only improves client outcomes but also contributes to a more just and equitable criminal justice system. Implications for policy and practice are discussed, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and systemic changes to support this comprehensive approach to indigent defense."}
