{"Abstract": "This paper explores the concept of 'Predatory Peace,' where periods of ostensible calm are marred by underlying criminal activities, cybercrime, and environmental degradation. It argues for a broader understanding of peace that encompasses not only the absence of war but also the active protection of the environment and the rule of law. Through an interdisciplinary approach, including insights from criminology, environmental science, and conflict studies, the paper highlights the need for a more holistic and sustainable model of peace. An autobiographical reflection provides a personal perspective on the complexities of achieving true peace in a world fraught with hidden threats."}
