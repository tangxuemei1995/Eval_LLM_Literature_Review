{"Abstract": "This study examines the pivotal role of victim advocacy in shaping criminal justice reform in England and Wales, highlighting the contributions of the women's movement. Through a comprehensive review of legislative changes and policy developments, the research underscores how victim support services have evolved to address the needs of marginalized groups, particularly women. The findings reveal that victim advocacy has not only improved the treatment of victims within the justice system but has also influenced broader societal attitudes towards victimization. The study concludes with recommendations for enhancing victim support frameworks to further empower victims and promote systemic change."}
