{"Abstract": "This paper explores the scope, significance, and future directions of historical criminology, a field that bridges the gap between criminology and history. By examining criminal justice systems, legal practices, and societal responses to crime over historical time, historical criminology offers unique insights into the evolution of crime and punishment. The interdisciplinary nature of this field, integrating methodologies from sociology, law, and history, enhances our understanding of the complex dynamics that shape criminal behavior and its regulation. This review highlights key contributions, including the analysis of archival data, the study of penal institutions, and the examination of social control mechanisms. Future research should focus on expanding the temporal and geographical scope of studies, incorporating digital humanities tools, and fostering collaboration across disciplines to address contemporary criminological issues through a historical lens."}
