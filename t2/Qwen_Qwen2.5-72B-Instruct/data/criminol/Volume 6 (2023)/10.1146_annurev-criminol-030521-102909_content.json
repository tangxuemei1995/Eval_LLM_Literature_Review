{"Abstract": "This review and analysis explores the complexities and challenges associated with the measurement of homicide in cross-national research. Homicide, a critical indicator of societal health and safety, is often subject to varying definitions, reporting practices, and data collection methods across different countries. These discrepancies can significantly impact the comparability and reliability of cross-national studies, leading to potential misinterpretations of trends and patterns. The paper begins by outlining the diverse legal and cultural contexts that influence how homicide is defined and recorded, highlighting the importance of standardization in research methodologies. It then examines the role of official statistics, such as those from police and judicial systems, and the limitations these sources may have, including underreporting and biases. The review also discusses alternative data sources, such as victimization surveys and media reports, and evaluates their strengths and weaknesses in providing a more comprehensive picture of homicide rates. Finally, the paper proposes a set of best practices for researchers, emphasizing the need for transparent and consistent measurement techniques, the integration of multiple data sources, and the consideration of contextual factors. By addressing these issues, the study aims to enhance the accuracy and robustness of cross-national homicide research, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of the global landscape of violent crime."}
