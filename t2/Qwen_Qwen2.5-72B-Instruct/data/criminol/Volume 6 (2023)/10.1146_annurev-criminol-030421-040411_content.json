{"Abstract": "This paper explores six critical questions surrounding the phenomenon of overcriminalization, a term used to describe the excessive expansion of criminal law into areas traditionally regulated by civil or administrative measures. The first question examines the criteria for criminalizing behavior, questioning whether all offenses currently classified as criminal genuinely represent significant harm to society. The second question delves into the role of discretion in law enforcement, highlighting how broad statutes can lead to arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement practices. The third question addresses the effectiveness of punishment, considering whether the severity and frequency of penalties are proportionate to the offenses committed and whether they achieve the intended deterrent effect. The fourth question investigates the impact of overcriminalization on the legal system, including the strain on judicial resources and the potential for wrongful convictions. The fifth question explores the availability and adequacy of legal defenses, assessing whether individuals have sufficient means to contest charges and protect their rights. Finally, the sixth question considers the broader social implications of overcriminalization, including its effects on public trust in the legal system and the stigmatization of minor offenders. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, this paper aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the complexities and consequences of overcriminalization, offering recommendations for reform to ensure a more just and effective legal framework."}
