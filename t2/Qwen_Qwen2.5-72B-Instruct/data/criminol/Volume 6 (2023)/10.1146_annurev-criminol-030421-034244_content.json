{"Abstract": "This study examines the relationship between police unionism, accountability mechanisms, and the incidence of police misconduct. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical analysis, the research explores how collective bargaining agreements and the Law Enforcement Bill of Rights (LEBR) influence the oversight and discipline of law enforcement officers. The findings suggest that strong police unions and LEBR provisions can create significant barriers to accountability, often leading to higher rates of use of force and misconduct. The study also highlights the need for reform in collective bargaining practices to enhance transparency and public trust in law enforcement. Implications for policy and future research are discussed, emphasizing the importance of balancing officers' rights with the need for effective accountability measures."}
