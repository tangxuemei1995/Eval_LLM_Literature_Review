{"Abstract": "This study examines the resilience of conservative criminal justice reforms in the face of rising crime rates. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, the research analyzes policy changes, legislative actions, and public opinion data from 2010 to 2023 in states with significant Republican influence. The findings suggest that while initial reforms aimed at reducing recidivism and promoting rehabilitation have shown positive outcomes, a surge in crime can lead to a reversion to more punitive measures. The study highlights the tension between the principles of the common good and the political pressures faced by conservative policymakers. It concludes that sustained support for reform requires a robust evidence base and a strategic communication of the long-term benefits of rehabilitation over incarceration."}
