{"Abstract": "This study explores the minimum level of supervision required for effective community supervision programs, including probation and parole, in the context of mass supervision. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical analysis of data from various jurisdictions, the research identifies key factors that influence the success of minimally supervised individuals. The findings suggest that a tailored, risk-based approach can significantly reduce the need for intensive supervision without compromising public safety or recidivism rates. The study also highlights the importance of leveraging technology and community resources to support individuals under supervision. Policy recommendations are provided to guide the implementation of more efficient and effective community supervision practices, emphasizing the potential for reducing the overall burden of mass supervision while maintaining or improving outcomes."}
