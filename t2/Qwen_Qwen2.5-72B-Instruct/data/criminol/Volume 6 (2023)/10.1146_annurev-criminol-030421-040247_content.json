{"Abstract": "This study examines the phenomenon of police killings in the United States from a comparative perspective, highlighting the exceptional nature of lethal force usage by American law enforcement. Drawing on data from multiple international sources, the research reveals that the rate of police killings in the U.S. is significantly higher than in other developed nations, a disparity that cannot be fully explained by differences in crime rates or societal violence. The analysis suggests that the decentralized structure of American policing, characterized by a lack of standardized protocols and oversight, plays a critical role in this disparity. Additionally, the study explores the impact of American exceptionalism on police culture and the legal framework that governs the use of force. The findings underscore the need for comprehensive reforms, including enhanced training, accountability measures, and a reevaluation of the legal standards that justify the use of lethal force. The implications of these findings extend beyond the U.S., offering insights into the broader challenges of ensuring police accountability and public safety in diverse policing contexts."}
