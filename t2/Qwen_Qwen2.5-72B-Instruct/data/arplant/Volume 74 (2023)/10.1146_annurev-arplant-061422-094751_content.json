{"Abstract": "This study explores the biomechanical principles underlying plant form and function, focusing on the structureâ€“function relationship in plant biology. By examining the bilayer and slender body mechanics, we uncover how plants optimize their structural integrity and resource efficiency. The self-similarity observed in plant architectures is analyzed to understand the scaling laws that govern their growth and development. These findings provide insights into the biological design strategies that plants employ to thrive in diverse environments, offering valuable lessons for engineering and materials science."}
