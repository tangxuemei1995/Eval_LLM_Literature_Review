{"Abstract": "The SWI/SNF family of chromatin remodelers plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression by altering the structure of chromatin. These complexes, powered by ATPases, facilitate the repositioning, eviction, or restructuring of nucleosomes, thereby modulating the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors and other regulatory proteins. Recent studies have highlighted the diverse functions of SWI/SNF remodelers in various biological processes, including development, differentiation, and cellular responses to environmental stimuli. The intricate interplay between SWI/SNF ATPases and the chromatin landscape is essential for the precise control of gene expression, ensuring that cells can adapt to changing conditions and maintain proper function. Mutations in SWI/SNF components have been implicated in a range of diseases, underscoring their importance in maintaining genomic stability and cellular homeostasis. This review summarizes the current understanding of the mechanisms by which SWI/SNF remodelers influence chromatin structure and function, and discusses their broader implications in health and disease."}
