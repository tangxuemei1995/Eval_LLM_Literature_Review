{"Abstract": "De novo domestication, leveraging advanced genome editing technologies, offers a promising approach to rapidly develop new crop varieties adapted to changing environmental conditions. This review explores the potential of genome editing in plant developmental genetics to domesticate wild species, enhancing traits such as yield, stress tolerance, and nutritional value. However, the process is not without challenges. Ethical considerations, regulatory hurdles, and the ecological impacts of introducing newly domesticated species must be carefully addressed. Additionally, the integration of ethnobotanical knowledge is crucial for selecting species with cultural and nutritional significance. As climate change exacerbates food security issues, de novo domestication could play a vital role in diversifying agricultural systems and ensuring sustainable food production. This paper discusses the scientific, ethical, and practical dimensions of this emerging field, highlighting both its transformative potential and the need for responsible innovation."}
