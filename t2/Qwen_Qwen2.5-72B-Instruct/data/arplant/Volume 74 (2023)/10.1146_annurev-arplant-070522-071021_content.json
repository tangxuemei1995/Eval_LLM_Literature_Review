{"Abstract": "Invasive plants, often referred to as alien or non-native species, pose significant ecological and economic challenges due to their rapid spread and dominance in new environments. This study explores the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the success of invasive plants, focusing on biotic interactions, competition, and ecosystem invasibility. Through a comprehensive review of functional traits associated with invasiveness, we identify key attributes such as rapid growth rates, high reproductive output, and adaptability to diverse environmental conditions. These traits enable invasive plants to outcompete native species for resources, alter community structures, and disrupt ecosystem functions. Additionally, the role of biotic interactions, including mutualisms and enemy release, is examined to understand how these relationships facilitate the establishment and spread of invasive species. The findings highlight the importance of integrating functional trait analysis with ecological context to predict and manage the impacts of invasive plants on native ecosystems."}
