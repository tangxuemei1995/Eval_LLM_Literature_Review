{"Abstract": "Proximity labeling (PL) techniques have emerged as powerful tools for elucidating the subcellular and cell type–specific proteomes in plants, offering unprecedented insights into protein–protein and protein–nucleotide interactions. These methods, such as BioID and APEX, enable the identification of proteins in their native cellular environments by labeling proteins in close proximity to a bait protein with biotin, which can then be isolated and identified through mass spectrometry. This review highlights recent advancements in PL methodologies, focusing on their application in plant systems to uncover dynamic protein interactions and subcellular organization. We discuss the optimization of PL conditions for various plant tissues and cell types, emphasizing the importance of minimizing background labeling and maximizing the specificity of the labeling reaction. Additionally, we explore the integration of PL with quantitative proteomics approaches, which allows for the precise quantification of protein abundance and interaction dynamics. The application of PL in plants has led to the discovery of novel protein complexes and regulatory mechanisms, contributing to a deeper understanding of plant biology. Future directions include the development of more sensitive and specific labeling enzymes, as well as the application of PL in combination with other omics technologies to provide a comprehensive view of cellular processes in plants."}
