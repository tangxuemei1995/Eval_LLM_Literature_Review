{"Abstract": "Between-plant signaling is a complex and dynamic process that facilitates communication and interaction among plants, often mediated by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) through common mycelial networks (CMNs). These networks enable the transfer of nutrients, water, and signaling molecules, allowing plants to coordinate their responses to environmental stresses, such as herbivory and pathogen attack. Recent studies have highlighted the role of CMNs in systemic signaling, where plants can warn their neighbors of impending threats, leading to enhanced defense mechanisms. Additionally, parasitic plants can exploit these networks to detect and target host plants, further complicating the interplay between species. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the mechanisms and ecological implications of between-plant signaling, emphasizing the importance of CMNs in facilitating these interactions and the potential applications in agriculture and ecosystem management."}
