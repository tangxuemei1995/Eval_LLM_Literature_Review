{"Abstract": "Plant volatiles play a crucial role in mediating ecological signaling, influencing plant interactions with both biotic and abiotic factors. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the spatial and temporal dynamics of plant volatiles, highlighting their role in defense, communication, and attraction. The release of volatiles is influenced by environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and wind, which can alter their dispersion and effectiveness. Spatial distributions of volatiles are critical for understanding how plants signal to neighbors and attract beneficial organisms, while temporal dynamics reveal the timing and duration of these signals. Despite significant advances, research gaps remain, particularly in elucidating the mechanisms that govern the production and release of volatiles under varying environmental conditions. Future studies should focus on integrating environmental chemistry and physics to better predict the ecological impacts of plant volatiles in natural and managed ecosystems."}
