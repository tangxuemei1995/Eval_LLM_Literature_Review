{"Abstract": "This review explores recent advancements in the field of plant photoperiodism, focusing on the mechanisms that plants use to measure day length and regulate their developmental processes. Traditional models of photoperiodism, such as the external coincidence hypothesis, have been expanded to include noncanonical photoperiod measurement systems that integrate metabolic and photosynthetic signals. These systems allow plants to fine-tune their responses to environmental cues, ensuring optimal growth and reproductive timing. Recent studies have identified key molecular components involved in these processes, including photoreceptors, circadian clock genes, and metabolic regulators. The integration of these findings into a comprehensive model of photoperiodic control highlights the complexity and adaptability of plant responses to changing day lengths. This review also discusses the implications of these discoveries for agricultural practices, particularly in the context of climate change and the need for crops with enhanced photoperiodic flexibility."}
