{"Abstract": "Plant hormones, or phytohormones, play crucial roles in regulating growth, development, and stress responses in plants. This review focuses on the transport and localization mechanisms of key phytohormones, including auxin (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), cytokinin (CK), gibberellin (GA), ethylene, and jasmonic acid (JA). Recent advances in identifying specific transporters and understanding their regulation have shed light on how these signaling molecules are precisely distributed within the plant. For instance, auxin transport is mediated by PIN and ABCB transporters, while ABA is transported by NRT1/PTR family proteins. The dynamic interplay between synthesis, transport, and degradation ensures hormone homeostasis, which is essential for coordinating plant responses to environmental cues. This review highlights the molecular mechanisms underlying hormone transport and their implications for plant development and stress adaptation."}
