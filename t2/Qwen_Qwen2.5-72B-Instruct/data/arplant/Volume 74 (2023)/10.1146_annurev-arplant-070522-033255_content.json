{"Abstract": "Plant glutamate receptor (GLR) ion channels represent a unique class of ligand-gated ion channels that play critical roles in various physiological processes, including cell excitability, cellâ€“cell communication, and calcium signaling. These channels, which are homologous to animal glutamate receptors, are activated by amino acids such as glutamate and are involved in the regulation of intracellular calcium levels, a key second messenger in plant signaling pathways. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of GLRs in mediating electric signaling and action potential propagation, processes that are essential for rapid responses to environmental stimuli. GLRs are also implicated in the transport of calcium ions across cell membranes, influencing a wide range of cellular functions, from stomatal movement to root growth and development. Moreover, the interaction between GLRs and other signaling molecules, such as glutathione, suggests a complex network of regulatory mechanisms that fine-tune plant responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses. This review integrates the current understanding of the structural and functional aspects of GLRs, emphasizing their role in integrating multiple signaling pathways and their potential as targets for enhancing plant resilience and productivity."}
