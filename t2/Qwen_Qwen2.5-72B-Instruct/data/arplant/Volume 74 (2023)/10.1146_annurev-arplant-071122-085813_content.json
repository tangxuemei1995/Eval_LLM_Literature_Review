{"Abstract": "RNA modifications play a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression and cellular processes in plants. This review summarizes the current understanding of the diversity and functions of mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA modifications in plants, with a focus on the well-characterized m6A and m5C modifications. These modifications are involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism, including splicing, stability, translation, and stress response. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of novel RNA modifications and their specific sites, providing insights into the functional diversity of RNA modifications in plants. The review also highlights the importance of RNA modifications in plant stress responses, such as drought, salinity, and pathogen attack, and discusses the potential of manipulating RNA modifications to enhance plant resilience. Future research directions include the development of tools to study the dynamic nature of RNA modifications and their impact on plant development and environmental adaptation."}
