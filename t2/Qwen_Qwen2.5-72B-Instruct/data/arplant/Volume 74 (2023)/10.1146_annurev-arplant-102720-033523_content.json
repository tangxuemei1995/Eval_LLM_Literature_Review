{"Abstract": "Auxin, a key phytohormone, orchestrates plant development through intricate signaling and transport mechanisms. This review integrates recent advances in auxin biology with computational approaches, highlighting the role of bioinformatics and computational modeling in elucidating auxin signaling pathways and polar auxin transport. By leveraging large-scale data sets and sophisticated algorithms, researchers can simulate auxin dynamics, predict gene regulatory networks, and design synthetic auxin-responsive systems. These computational tools not only enhance our understanding of auxin's role in plant development and evolution but also pave the way for innovative applications in synthetic biology. This interdisciplinary approach bridges the gap between molecular biology and computational science, offering new insights into the complex auxin matrix that governs plant growth and form."}
