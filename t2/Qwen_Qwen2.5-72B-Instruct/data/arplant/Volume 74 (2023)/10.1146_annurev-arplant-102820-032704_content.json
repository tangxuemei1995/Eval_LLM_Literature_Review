{"Abstract": "The phyllosphere microbiome, a critical component of the plant's phytobiome, encompasses the diverse microbial communities inhabiting the above-ground surfaces of plants. These communities, including epiphytes and endophytes, play pivotal roles in plant health and productivity. Recent studies have highlighted the parallels between the phyllosphere microbiome and the gut microbiome in terms of their influence on host immunity and metabolism. Dysbiosis in the phyllosphere can lead to plant diseases and reduced resilience to environmental stresses. Understanding the intricate interactions between these microbial communities and their plant hosts is essential for developing strategies to enhance plant immunity and promote sustainable agriculture. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the composition, dynamics, and functional roles of the phyllosphere microbiome, emphasizing the potential for microbial manipulation to improve plant health and productivity."}
