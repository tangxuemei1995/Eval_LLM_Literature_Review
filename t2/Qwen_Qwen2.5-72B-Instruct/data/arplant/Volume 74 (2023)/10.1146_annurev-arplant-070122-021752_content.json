{"Abstract": "Lipid droplets (LDs) are dynamic organelles that play a crucial role in the storage and metabolism of hydrophobic molecules, particularly triacylglycerols (TAGs), within the aqueous cytoplasm of cells. These organelles are found in a wide range of organisms, from bacteria to humans, and are especially prominent in seeds and other storage tissues. The biogenesis of LDs involves the assembly of TAGs into a hydrophobic core, which is surrounded by a monolayer of phospholipids and a diverse array of proteins, including perilipins and seipins. These proteins not only stabilize the LDs but also regulate their growth, fusion, and degradation. The compartmentation of TAGs within LDs is essential for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and protecting the cell from lipotoxicity. In seeds, LDs, often referred to as oil bodies, are a major source of energy and carbon for germination and early seedling growth. Recent advances in imaging and proteomic techniques have provided new insights into the dynamic nature of LDs, revealing their involvement in various cellular processes, including lipid signaling, membrane trafficking, and stress responses. Understanding the mechanisms of LD biogenesis and metabolism is crucial for developing strategies to enhance oil production in plants and to treat metabolic disorders in humans."}
