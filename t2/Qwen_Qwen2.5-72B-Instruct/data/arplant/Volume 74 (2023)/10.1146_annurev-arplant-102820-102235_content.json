{"Abstract": "Temperature sensing is a critical mechanism in plants, enabling them to adapt to environmental changes and optimize growth. In Arabidopsis thaliana, recent studies have identified specific thermosensors that play key roles in thermomorphogenesis, the process by which plants alter their development in response to temperature. These thermosensors, including histone deacetylases and heat shock transcription factors, help plants respond to both heat and cold stress. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying temperature sensing can provide insights into how plants adapt to climate change and inform strategies for improving crop resilience. This review summarizes the current knowledge on thermosensors in Arabidopsis, highlighting their roles in heat and cold stress responses and their implications for plant adaptation."}
