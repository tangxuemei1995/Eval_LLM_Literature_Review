{"Abstract": "Salinity is a major abiotic stress affecting crop productivity worldwide, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. With the increasing demand for food security, developing salt-tolerant crops has become imperative. This review explores the latest advancements in enhancing salinity tolerance in crops through various approaches, including the utilization of crop wild relatives, neodomestication, and genetic modification. Crop wild relatives, which possess a rich genetic diversity, offer valuable traits for improving salt tolerance. Neodomestication, the process of domesticating wild species, provides an alternative strategy to enhance crop resilience. Genetic modification techniques, such as CRISPR/Cas9, have also shown promise in conferring salt tolerance by targeting specific genes involved in ion transport and osmotic adjustment. Integrating these approaches can lead to the development of more robust and productive salt-tolerant crops, contributing significantly to global food security in the face of increasing soil salinity."}
