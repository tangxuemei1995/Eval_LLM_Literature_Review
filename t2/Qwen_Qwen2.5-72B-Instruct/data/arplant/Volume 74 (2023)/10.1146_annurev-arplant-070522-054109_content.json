{"Abstract": "Mutation rates in plant genomes exhibit significant variability, influenced by a complex interplay of molecular and environmental factors. This study explores the role of DNA repair mechanisms and chromatin structure in modulating mutation rates across different plant species. We find that regions of the genome with more open chromatin states are associated with higher mutation rates, likely due to increased accessibility to mutagenic agents. Additionally, variations in the efficiency of DNA repair pathways, particularly those involved in mismatch repair and nucleotide excision repair, contribute to the observed variability. These findings provide insights into the molecular underpinnings of mutation rate differences and their implications for plant evolution and adaptation."}
