{"Abstract": "Chloroplasts, essential organelles in plant cells, maintain a complex proteostasis network to ensure proper function and development. This network encompasses the import of nuclear-encoded proteins, their sorting to specific chloroplast compartments, and the regulation of protein turnover through ubiquitination and proteolysis. Recent studies have elucidated the mechanisms of protein translocation across chloroplast membranes, highlighting the roles of translocons and chaperones. Within the chloroplast, proteins are sorted to the stroma, thylakoids, and other subcompartments via specific targeting signals. Ubiquitination, a key regulatory process, marks proteins for degradation by the chloroplast proteasome or other proteolytic systems. This review summarizes the current understanding of chloroplast proteostasis, emphasizing the interplay between import, sorting, ubiquitination, and proteolysis, and discusses the implications for chloroplast function and plant stress responses."}
