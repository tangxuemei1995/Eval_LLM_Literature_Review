{"Abstract": "Epigenetic regulation plays a crucial role in plant development and the plant's response to environmental cues, such as heat stress. This study explores the mechanisms of epigenetic memory, focusing on histone modifications and DNA methylation, which are essential for the stable inheritance of gene expression patterns. Transposable elements, often silenced by these epigenetic marks, can become active under stress conditions, potentially contributing to adaptive responses. We review recent findings on how these epigenetic modifications are established and maintained during key developmental stages, and how they can be reprogrammed in response to environmental changes. Our analysis highlights the dynamic nature of the epigenome and its significance in plant resilience and evolution."}
