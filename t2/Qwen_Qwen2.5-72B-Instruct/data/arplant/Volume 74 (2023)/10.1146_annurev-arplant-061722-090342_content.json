{"Abstract": "Mycorrhizal symbiosis plays a crucial role in plant growth and stress adaptation, influencing nutrient exchange and ecosystem dynamics. This review explores the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying mycorrhizal associations, the function of common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs) in facilitating resource sharing, and the role of mycorrhizae helper bacteria (MHB) in enhancing symbiotic efficiency. The autoregulation of mycorrhizae (ARM) pathway is discussed as a key regulatory mechanism that balances symbiotic interactions. Recent studies highlight the importance of mycorrhizal fungi in improving plant resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses, such as drought, salinity, and pathogen attack. The integration of these findings into ecosystem management practices can enhance soil health and agricultural sustainability. This comprehensive overview underscores the multifaceted benefits of mycorrhizal symbiosis, from individual plant fitness to broader ecological resilience."}
