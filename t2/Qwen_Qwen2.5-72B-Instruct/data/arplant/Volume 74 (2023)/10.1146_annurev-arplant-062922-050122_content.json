{"Abstract": "The BAHD acyltransferase gene family plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of a wide array of secondary metabolites in plants, including hydroxycinnamoyl esters and amides. These enzymes, particularly hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT), are essential for the production of phenylpropanoids, which are vital for plant defense, UV protection, and structural integrity. Recent studies have expanded our understanding of the diverse functions of BAHD acyltransferases, revealing their involvement in the synthesis of acylsugars and other specialized metabolites. This review highlights the evolutionary history of the BAHD family, tracing its expansion and diversification across land plants. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency of these enzymes, as well as their impact on plant adaptation and survival. The ever-expanding roles of BAHD acyltransferases underscore their significance in plant biology and provide a foundation for future biotechnological applications."}
