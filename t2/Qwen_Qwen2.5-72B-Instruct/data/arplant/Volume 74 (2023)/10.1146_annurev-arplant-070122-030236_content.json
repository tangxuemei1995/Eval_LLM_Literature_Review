{"Abstract": "cis-Regulatory elements (CREs) play a pivotal role in the precise control of gene expression, which is essential for plant development, adaptation, and evolution. These elements, including promoters, enhancers, and silencers, interact with transcription factors and chromatin modifiers to modulate the transcriptional response to environmental cues and developmental signals. Recent advances in genomics and epigenomics have provided insights into the complex regulatory networks involving CREs, revealing their dynamic nature and the importance of chromatin structure in transcription regulation. Studies have shown that CREs are hotspots for evolutionary divergence, contributing to species-specific traits and adaptive responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Understanding the function and evolution of CREs is crucial for unraveling the mechanisms underlying plant plasticity and for developing strategies to enhance crop resilience in changing environments."}
