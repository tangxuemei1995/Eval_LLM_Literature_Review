{"Abstract": "Small RNAs (sRNAs) play crucial roles in plant development and stress responses. This review focuses on the biogenesis, regulatory roles, and functions of microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), phased siRNAs (phasiRNAs), and mobile siRNAs in plants. miRNAs are processed from hairpin structures by Dicer-like enzymes and guide ARGONAUTE proteins to target mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression. siRNAs, derived from double-stranded RNA precursors, mediate gene silencing through RNA-directed DNA methylation and post-transcriptional gene silencing. phasiRNAs, generated in a miRNA-dependent manner, regulate gene expression during development and stress responses. Mobile siRNAs can move between cells and tissues, coordinating gene expression over long distances. These sRNAs are essential for various developmental processes, including organ formation, flowering, and root development, as well as for defense against pathogens and abiotic stresses. Understanding the intricate regulatory networks involving sRNAs is crucial for advancing plant biology and biotechnology."}
