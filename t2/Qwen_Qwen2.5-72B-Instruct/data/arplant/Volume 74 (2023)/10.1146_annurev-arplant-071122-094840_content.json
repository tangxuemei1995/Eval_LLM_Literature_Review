{"Abstract": "Optogenetic methods have revolutionized the study of plant biology by enabling precise spatiotemporal control over cellular processes. This review highlights recent advancements in the use of photoreceptors, rhodopsins, and optoswitches to manipulate gene expression, protein localization, and signaling pathways in plants. Key developments include the engineering of light-sensitive biosensors that allow real-time monitoring of intracellular events, such as calcium dynamics and hormone signaling. Additionally, the integration of optogenetic tools with CRISPR-Cas systems has facilitated the precise editing of plant genomes in response to light stimuli. These techniques not only enhance our understanding of fundamental plant processes but also offer promising applications in crop improvement and synthetic biology. The continued refinement of optogenetic tools and their application in diverse plant species will further expand the horizons of plant research and biotechnology."}
