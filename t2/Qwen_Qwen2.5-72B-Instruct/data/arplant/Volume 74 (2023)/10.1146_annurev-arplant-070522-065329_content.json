{"Abstract": "Circadian rhythms, the intrinsic biological clocks that regulate physiological processes on a 24-hour cycle, play a crucial role in the adaptation of organisms to their environments. This review explores the intersection of circadian rhythms with changing environmental conditions, particularly in the context of climate change. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of circadian signaling networks in mediating responses to environmental cues such as light, temperature, and humidity. These networks enable organisms to anticipate and prepare for daily and seasonal changes, optimizing their metabolic and behavioral activities. However, rapid environmental changes due to climate change can disrupt these finely tuned rhythms, leading to mismatches between internal clocks and external conditions. This disruption can have significant impacts on health, survival, and reproductive success. Understanding the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying circadian adaptation is essential for predicting and mitigating the effects of environmental changes on biodiversity and ecosystem function."}
