{"Abstract": "Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), exhibit remarkable heterogeneity and play critical roles in both health and disease. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have enabled the detailed characterization of microglial transcriptional signatures, revealing distinct subpopulations with specialized functions. This review synthesizes current knowledge on microglial heterogeneity, highlighting key transcriptomic profiles associated with different physiological and pathological states. We discuss how these signatures can provide insights into microglial activation, phagocytic activity, and neuroinflammatory responses. Additionally, we explore the potential of these findings to inform therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, where microglial dysfunction is implicated. By integrating transcriptomic data with functional studies, this work aims to advance our understanding of microglial biology and pave the way for targeted interventions in CNS disorders."}
