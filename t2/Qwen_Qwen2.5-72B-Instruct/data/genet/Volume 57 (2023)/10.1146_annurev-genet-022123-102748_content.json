{"Abstract": "Coral reef ecosystems are under unprecedented threat from global climate change, necessitating a deeper understanding of their genetic diversity and adaptive potential. This study employs population genomics to investigate local adaptation and dispersal patterns in coral reef fish species across the Indo-Pacific. By analyzing genomic data from multiple populations, we identify key loci under selection that may confer resilience to rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification. Our findings suggest that while some populations exhibit signs of local adaptation, others may require evolutionary rescue through enhanced gene flow. The implications of these results are critical for the development of conservation strategies aimed at preserving coral reef biodiversity in the face of ongoing environmental change."}
