{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in single-cell genomics have revolutionized our ability to dissect the genetic basis of complex traits. This study integrates single-cell RNA sequencing and chromatin accessibility data with quantitative genetics approaches to identify key genetic variants and regulatory elements underlying trait variation. By analyzing a large cohort of mutants and natural populations, we uncover novel gene regulatory networks and epistatic interactions that contribute to phenotypic diversity. Our findings highlight the importance of cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms in shaping complex traits and provide a framework for understanding the genetic architecture of multifactorial diseases and traits."}
