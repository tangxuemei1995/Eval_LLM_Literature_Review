{"Abstract": "Pooled genome-scale CRISPR screens in single cells represent a powerful approach to dissecting gene function and regulatory networks. By integrating CRISPR technology with high-throughput single-cell sequencing and advanced cell sorting techniques, this method enables the precise identification of genetic elements that influence cellular phenotypes. This study demonstrates the application of this integrated approach to uncover novel gene functions and interactions in diverse cell types. Through the analysis of thousands of individual cells, we identify key regulators of cell fate and response to environmental stimuli. The results highlight the utility of pooled CRISPR screens in single cells for advancing our understanding of complex biological processes and provide a robust framework for future functional genomics studies."}
