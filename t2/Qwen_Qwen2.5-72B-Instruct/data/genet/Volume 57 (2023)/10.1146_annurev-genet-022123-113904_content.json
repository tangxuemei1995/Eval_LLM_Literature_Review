{"Abstract": "This study explores the complex interplay between antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and global environmental change, focusing on the role of anthropogenic activities and climate change. The widespread use and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, coupled with industrial and agricultural practices, have led to significant environmental contamination, creating conditions that favor the emergence and spread of AMR. Climate change exacerbates this issue by altering microbial ecosystems and increasing the frequency of extreme weather events, which can disperse resistant bacteria and genes. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the environmental drivers of AMR, highlighting the need for integrated strategies that address both the reduction of antibiotic use and the mitigation of environmental impacts. The findings underscore the importance of a One Health approach to combat AMR, emphasizing the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health."}
