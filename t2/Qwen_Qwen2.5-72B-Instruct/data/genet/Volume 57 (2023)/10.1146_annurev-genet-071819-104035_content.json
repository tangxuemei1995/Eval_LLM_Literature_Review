{"Abstract": "Paramecium, a model organism in the ciliate phylum, has been a cornerstone in the study of evolutionary cell biology and genomics. This review synthesizes recent advancements in understanding the genetic and genomic underpinnings of Paramecium, highlighting the significance of gene duplication and population genomics in shaping its evolutionary trajectory. Gene duplication events, particularly those resulting in the expansion of gene families, have played a crucial role in the functional diversification and adaptation of Paramecium. Comparative genomics studies reveal that these duplications have contributed to the organism's complex cellular processes, including ciliary motility and signaling pathways. Additionally, population genomics approaches have provided insights into the genetic diversity and population structure of Paramecium, elucidating the mechanisms of genetic drift, selection, and gene flow. These findings not only enhance our understanding of ciliate biology but also offer broader implications for the study of genome evolution and the dynamics of genetic variation in unicellular eukaryotes."}
