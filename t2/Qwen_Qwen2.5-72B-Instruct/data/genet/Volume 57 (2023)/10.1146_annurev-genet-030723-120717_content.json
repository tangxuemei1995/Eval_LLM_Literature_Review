{"Abstract": "This study explores advanced strategies for identifying noncoding regulatory variants, integrating GWAS data with rare-variant association tests and machine learning algorithms. We highlight the importance of functional assays in validating enhancer activity and demonstrate how these approaches can effectively uncover disease-associated variants in the vast noncoding genome."}
