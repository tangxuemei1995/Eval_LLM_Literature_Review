{"Abstract": "Developmental biology has long sought to understand the intricate mechanisms that govern the timing and progression of embryogenesis. This review explores the current understanding of the molecular and cellular processes that regulate developmental rate, collectively referred to as biological clocks. Recent advances in genomics and systems biology have shed light on the complex interplay between genetic networks, environmental cues, and cellular metabolism in controlling the pace of embryonic development. Key findings include the identification of conserved genetic pathways, such as the Notch and Wnt signaling cascades, which act as temporal regulators during critical developmental stages. Additionally, the role of epigenetic modifications and the circadian clock in modulating developmental timing is discussed, highlighting their importance in coordinating the sequential activation of gene expression programs. The review also examines the impact of external factors, such as temperature and nutrient availability, on developmental rate, and how these factors can be integrated into the internal timing mechanisms of the embryo. Understanding these regulatory mechanisms is crucial for advancing fields such as regenerative medicine and synthetic biology, where precise control over developmental processes is essential."}
