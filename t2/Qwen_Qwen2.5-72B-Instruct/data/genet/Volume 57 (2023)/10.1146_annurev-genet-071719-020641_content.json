{"Abstract": "This study explores the integration of complex life cycles within the framework of comparative developmental biology, focusing on the evolution and diversification of larval forms and their transition into adult body plans. By analyzing the developmental trajectories of various species, we highlight the significance of larval stages in shaping adult morphology, particularly in the formation of the head and trunk regions. Our findings suggest that the developmental mode during the larval stage plays a crucial role in the evolution of body plans, influencing the diversity of adult forms observed across different taxa. This research underscores the importance of considering the entire life cycle, rather than isolated developmental stages, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms driving morphological evolution."}
