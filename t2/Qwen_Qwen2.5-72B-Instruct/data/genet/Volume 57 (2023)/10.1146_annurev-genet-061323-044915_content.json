{"Abstract": "Meiosis, a specialized cell division, is crucial for sexual reproduction, ensuring genetic diversity through the precise pairing and recombination of homologous chromosomes. This process, distinct from mitosis, involves complex mechanisms that facilitate the accurate segregation of genetic material. Crossover interference, a phenomenon where crossovers are non-randomly distributed along chromosomes, plays a key role in maintaining genome stability. Evolutionary studies highlight the conservation of meiotic mechanisms across species, underscoring their fundamental importance. This review explores the intricate choreography of meiotic events, emphasizing the molecular and genetic factors that govern chromosome pairing, recombination, and the regulation of crossover interference, and contrasts these processes with those in mitosis."}
