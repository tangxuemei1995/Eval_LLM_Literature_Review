{"Abstract": "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have emerged as a powerful tool in disease biology, offering a unique platform to study human diseases in vitro. By reprogramming somatic cells to a pluripotent state, iPSCs can be differentiated into various cell types, enabling the modeling of complex genetic disorders and the investigation of gene regulation mechanisms. Recent advances have shown that iPSC-derived organoids can recapitulate key aspects of human tissues, providing valuable insights into disease pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets. This review summarizes the current evidence for the utility of iPSCs in understanding human diseases, highlighting their applications in genetics, drug screening, and personalized medicine."}
