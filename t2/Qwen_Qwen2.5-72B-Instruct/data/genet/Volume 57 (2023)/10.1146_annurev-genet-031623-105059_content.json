{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of CRISPR technology for genetic biocontrol in wild populations, focusing on gene drive mechanisms for population suppression and modification. By leveraging homing strategies, we demonstrate the potential to alter the genetic composition of target species, offering new avenues for ecological management and disease control."}
