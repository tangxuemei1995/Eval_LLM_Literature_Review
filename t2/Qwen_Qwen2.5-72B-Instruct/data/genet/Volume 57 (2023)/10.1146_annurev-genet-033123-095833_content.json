{"Abstract": "Programmed cell death (PCD) is a fundamental biological process that is crucial for the development and maintenance of both unicellular and multicellular organisms. In unicellular organisms, such as bacteria and yeast, PCD plays a role in stress response, population control, and altruistic behavior, contributing to the survival of the microbial community. In contrast, multicellular organisms utilize PCD for more complex functions, including the elimination of damaged or superfluous cells, sculpting of tissues during development, and immune system regulation. Despite these differences, recent studies have revealed conserved molecular mechanisms underlying PCD across diverse taxa, suggesting an evolutionary continuity in the regulation of cell death. This review explores the similarities and differences in PCD between unicellular and multicellular organisms, highlighting the molecular pathways and functional roles that define this essential process in both microorganisms and higher organisms."}
