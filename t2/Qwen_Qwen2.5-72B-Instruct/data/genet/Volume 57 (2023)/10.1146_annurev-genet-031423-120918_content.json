{"Abstract": "Color patterns in vertebrates are a result of complex interactions between genetic, developmental, and environmental factors. This review explores the mechanisms underlying the formation and evolution of these patterns, focusing on the roles of pigment-producing cells (melanocytes, xanthophores, and iridophores) and their interactions. Key signaling pathways, such as the Wnt/Î²-catenin and Hedgehog pathways, are discussed in the context of pattern formation. Additionally, the influence of environmental cues and genetic mutations on coloration is examined, highlighting how these factors contribute to the diversity of color patterns observed in nature. Understanding these mechanisms provides insights into the adaptive significance of coloration and its role in survival and reproduction."}
