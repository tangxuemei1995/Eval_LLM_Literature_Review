{"Abstract": "Asymmetric stem cell division is a critical mechanism that ensures the maintenance of stem cell populations and the generation of differentiated progeny. In the context of germline immortality, this process is particularly vital, as it allows for the perpetuation of genetic information across generations. Recent studies have highlighted the role of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in regulating asymmetric division and its impact on aging. Specifically, variations in rDNA copy number and transcriptional activity can influence the balance between self-renewal and differentiation, thereby affecting the longevity of germline cells. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying asymmetric stem cell division and their implications for germline immortality and aging."}
