{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in the field of RNA repair have unveiled a sophisticated array of mechanisms that cells employ to maintain the integrity of their tRNA molecules. Central to this process are the enzymes involved in tRNA splicing, end healing, and end sealing, which collectively ensure the functional restoration of damaged tRNAs. Polynucleotide kinaseâ€“phosphatase (PNKP) plays a crucial role in the initial step of end healing by removing or adding phosphate groups, preparing the RNA ends for ligation. RNA ligase then catalyzes the final step, sealing the broken ends. These processes, once overlooked, are now recognized as essential for cellular homeostasis and have implications in various diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. The discovery of these enzymes not only highlights the complexity of RNA repair but also opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting RNA damage."}
