{"Abstract": "Transcriptionâ€“replication conflicts (TRCs) occur when the transcription and replication machineries collide on the same DNA template, leading to genomic instability. These conflicts can result in replication fork stalling, increased mutation rates, and chromosomal rearrangements. The interaction between the replisome and RNA polymerase is a major source of replication stress, which can be exacerbated by factors such as transcriptional activity, origin firing, and the efficiency of DNA repair mechanisms. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of regulatory pathways that mitigate TRCs, including the coordination of transcription and replication timing, and the activation of checkpoint responses to maintain genome integrity. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying TRCs is crucial for elucidating the causes of genomic instability in both normal and disease states."}
