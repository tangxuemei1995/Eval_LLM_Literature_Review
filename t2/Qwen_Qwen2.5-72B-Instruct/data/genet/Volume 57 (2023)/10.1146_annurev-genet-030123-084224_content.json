{"Abstract": "Systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAIDs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammation without the presence of high-titer autoantibodies or antigen-specific T cells. This review explores the genetic underpinnings of SAIDs, highlighting the roles of monogenic, digenic, and polygenic factors. Recent studies have identified numerous mutations in genes involved in innate immune signaling pathways, such as NLRP3 and MEFV, which are associated with monogenic forms of SAIDs. Additionally, digenic and polygenic inheritance patterns have been implicated in the pathogenesis of more complex SAIDs, suggesting a multifactorial etiology. Epigenetic modifications and somatic mutations further contribute to the disease spectrum, influencing disease onset and severity. Understanding these genetic and epigenetic mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted therapies and improving patient outcomes."}
