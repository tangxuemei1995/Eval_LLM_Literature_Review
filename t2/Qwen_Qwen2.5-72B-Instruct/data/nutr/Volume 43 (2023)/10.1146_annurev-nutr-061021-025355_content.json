{"Abstract": "The microbiota–gut–brain (MGB) axis plays a crucial role in the development and function of the central nervous system, and early life nutrition significantly influences this axis. This review synthesizes current knowledge on how maternal and infant nutrition impact the MGB axis. Maternal dietary components, such as long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), prebiotics, and probiotics, can modulate the infant's gut microbiota and brain development through breast milk. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) and milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) are key bioactive compounds that support the establishment of a healthy gut microbiota and promote neurodevelopment. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that these components can enhance cognitive function, reduce inflammation, and improve gut barrier integrity. However, the mechanisms by which these nutrients influence the MGB axis are complex and multifaceted, involving both direct and indirect pathways. Future research should focus on elucidating these mechanisms and identifying optimal nutritional strategies to support healthy MGB axis development in infants."}
