{"Abstract": "Dietary supplements are widely used, yet significant gaps remain in our understanding of their impact on health and disease. This review highlights critical issues in the validity and reproducibility of dietary supplement assessment methods. Current methodologies, including food frequency questionnaires and 24-hour dietary recalls, are prone to measurement errors, leading to underestimation or overestimation of supplement intake. These inaccuracies complicate the interpretation of epidemiological studies and clinical trials, making it difficult to establish clear associations between supplement use and health outcomes. Additionally, there is a lack of standardized protocols for assessing supplement intake, which hinders comparability across studies. The review also discusses the need for more sophisticated biomarkers to validate self-reported data and improve the accuracy of dietary supplement assessments. Addressing these methodological challenges is essential for advancing our knowledge of the role of dietary supplements in health promotion and disease prevention."}
