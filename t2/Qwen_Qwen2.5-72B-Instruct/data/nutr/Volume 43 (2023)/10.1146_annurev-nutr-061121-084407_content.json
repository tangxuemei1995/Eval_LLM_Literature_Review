{"Abstract": "Riboflavin, a water-soluble B vitamin, plays a crucial role in cellular metabolism and antioxidant defense. This review examines the causes and clinical sequelae of riboflavin deficiency, focusing on the erythrocyte glutathione reductase activation coefficient (EGRac) as a biomarker for assessing riboflavin status. Dietary insufficiency, particularly in populations with limited access to riboflavin-rich foods, is a primary cause of deficiency. The deficiency can lead to a range of clinical manifestations, including anemia and hypertension, which are exacerbated by impaired antioxidant function and disrupted energy metabolism. Current dietary reference intakes (DRIs) for riboflavin are based on limited data, highlighting the need for more comprehensive studies to refine these recommendations. This review also discusses the potential benefits of riboflavin supplementation in mitigating the adverse health outcomes associated with deficiency."}
