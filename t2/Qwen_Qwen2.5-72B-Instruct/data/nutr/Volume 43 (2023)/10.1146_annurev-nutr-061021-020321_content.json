{"Abstract": "This paper presents an in-depth conversation with Dr. James Ntambi, a distinguished professor and researcher in the field of nutritional biochemistry. Dr. Ntambi shares his journey from his early education in Uganda to his groundbreaking research on stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), a key enzyme in fat metabolism. His work has significantly advanced our understanding of nutrient–gene interactions, particularly in the context of dietary fats and their impact on gene expression. Dr. Ntambi discusses the implications of his research for understanding and addressing malnutrition, a critical global health issue. He also reflects on the challenges and rewards of balancing a rigorous research agenda with a commitment to teaching and mentoring the next generation of scientists. The conversation highlights the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in nutritional biochemistry and the potential for translating basic research into practical solutions for improving public health. Dr. Ntambi’s insights provide valuable perspectives on the evolving landscape of nutritional science and the role of research in shaping health policies and interventions."}
