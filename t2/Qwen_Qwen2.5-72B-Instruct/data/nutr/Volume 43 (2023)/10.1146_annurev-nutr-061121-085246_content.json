{"Abstract": "The placenta serves as a critical maternofetal interface, facilitating the exchange of nutrients, gases, and waste products between the mother and the developing fetus. This organ is characterized by the syncytiotrophoblast, a multinucleated layer that plays a pivotal role in histiotrophic and hemotrophic nutrition. Histiotrophic nutrition, predominant in early gestation, involves the transfer of nutrients through the extracellular matrix, while hemotrophic nutrition, which dominates later stages, relies on direct blood flow. Placental mosaicism, the presence of genetically diverse cell populations, can influence placental function and fetal development. Nutrient transporters, such as glucose transporters and amino acid transporters, are essential for maintaining the nutrient supply to the fetus. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for elucidating the complexities of placental biology and its impact on pregnancy outcomes."}
