{"Abstract": "Gluconeogenesis, the metabolic pathway responsible for de novo glucose synthesis, plays a critical role in maintaining glucose homeostasis. This study investigates the impact of altered gluconeogenic flux on metabolic diseases, particularly in the context of insulin resistance and enzyme deficiencies. Utilizing a combination of stable isotope tracing and metabolic flux analysis, we demonstrate that dysregulated hormonal signaling and impaired enzymatic activities contribute to increased gluconeogenesis in insulin-resistant states. Furthermore, the study highlights the potential of targeting specific enzymes in the gluconeogenic pathway as a therapeutic strategy for metabolic disorders and cancer, where aberrant glucose metabolism is a hallmark. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying metabolic disease and offer promising avenues for intervention."}
