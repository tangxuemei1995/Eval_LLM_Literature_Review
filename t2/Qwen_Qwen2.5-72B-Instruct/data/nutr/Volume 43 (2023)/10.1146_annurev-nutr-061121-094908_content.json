{"Abstract": "The intricate relationship between diet, the gut microbiome, and gastrointestinal (GI) disorders is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in the development and management of conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and functional dyspepsia. This review explores the role of diet–microbiome interactions in modulating the gut–brain axis and the subsequent impact on inflammation and metabolic processes. Metabolomics studies have revealed that specific dietary components, such as fermentable fibers and polyphenols, can influence the composition and activity of the gut microbiota, leading to the production of beneficial metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These metabolites play a pivotal role in maintaining gut barrier integrity and regulating immune responses. However, dysbiosis, often induced by a Western diet high in fat and sugar, can disrupt these processes, contributing to chronic inflammation and GI symptoms. Emerging microbiome-targeted therapies, including prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), offer promising strategies to restore microbial balance and alleviate symptoms. This review highlights the potential of these interventions and underscores the importance of personalized dietary approaches in the management of GI disorders."}
