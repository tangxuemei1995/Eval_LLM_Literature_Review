{"Abstract": "Precision nutrition, a burgeoning field that tailors dietary recommendations to individual characteristics, has garnered significant attention. However, the current hype surrounding precision nutrition may be outpacing the scientific evidence and robust standards required to inform public health policies. This review critically evaluates the existing literature on precision nutrition, highlighting the gaps in understanding biological variation and the challenges in translating personalized dietary interventions into effective public health strategies. Despite promising preliminary findings, the complexity of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors influencing nutrient requirements necessitates a more rigorous and comprehensive approach. The paper argues for a cautious integration of precision nutrition into public health recommendations, emphasizing the need for large-scale, well-controlled studies to establish the efficacy and feasibility of personalized dietary advice in preventing chronic diseases. Furthermore, it calls for a multidisciplinary effort to develop standardized methodologies and regulatory frameworks to ensure the reliability and safety of precision nutrition interventions."}
