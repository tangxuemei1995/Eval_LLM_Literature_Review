{"Abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent condition characterized by excessive accumulation of fat in liver cells, often progressing to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), inflammation, and fibrosis. Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have emerged as promising therapeutic agents due to their anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering properties. This review examines the mechanisms by which omega-3 fatty acids modulate hepatic lipid metabolism, reduce oxidative stress, and inhibit inflammatory pathways, thereby mitigating the progression of NAFLD to NASH. Clinical studies have shown that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids can improve liver enzyme levels, reduce hepatic steatosis, and ameliorate markers of inflammation and fibrosis. However, the optimal dosage and duration of treatment remain areas of ongoing investigation. This paper also discusses the potential synergistic effects of omega-3 fatty acids with other therapeutic interventions, highlighting the importance of a multifaceted approach to managing NAFLD and NASH."}
