{"Abstract": "Osteocalcin, a protein primarily synthesized by osteoblasts, exhibits multifaceted roles beyond bone mineralization. This undercarboxylated form of osteocalcin acts as a hormone, influencing energy metabolism by enhancing insulin secretion and sensitivity. Recent studies have also linked osteocalcin to behavioral responses, suggesting it may serve as a danger repellent by modulating fear and anxiety. This review explores the molecular mechanisms and physiological implications of osteocalcin, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic disorders and stress-related conditions."}
