{"Abstract": "This study examines the current methodologies and frameworks for assessing and monitoring nutrition security in the United States, with a focus on promoting healthy dietary intake and outcomes. Nutrition security, which extends beyond mere food availability to encompass access, utilization, and stability of a nutritious diet, is critical for public health. The research integrates data from national surveys, such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the USDAâ€™s Household Food Security Survey Module, to evaluate the effectiveness of existing programs and policies. Key findings highlight the need for more comprehensive and integrated approaches to address disparities in nutrition security, particularly among vulnerable populations. The study also proposes a multi-faceted monitoring system that incorporates real-time data and community-based participatory research to enhance the responsiveness and adaptability of interventions. These insights are essential for developing evidence-based strategies to improve dietary quality and health outcomes across the nation."}
