{"Abstract": "This review examines the role of intestinal amino acid transport in metabolic health, focusing on the mechanisms of membrane transport in epithelial cells and the impact of dietary protein restriction. Amino acid transporters, located on the apical and basolateral membranes of intestinal epithelial cells, are crucial for the efficient absorption of dietary amino acids. Recent studies highlight the adaptive responses of these transporters to protein restriction, which can influence systemic amino acid availability and metabolic pathways. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing dietary interventions that optimize metabolic health, particularly in conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. The review also discusses the potential therapeutic implications of modulating intestinal amino acid transport for improving metabolic outcomes."}
