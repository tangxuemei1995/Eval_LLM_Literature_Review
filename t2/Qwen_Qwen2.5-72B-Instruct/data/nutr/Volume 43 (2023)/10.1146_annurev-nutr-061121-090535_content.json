{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in elucidating the complex relationships between diet and disease, with a focus on precision and personalized nutrition. Utilizing advanced neural networks, the research analyzes large-scale dietary and health data to identify specific dietary patterns and biomarkers associated with various diseases. Case studies include the impact of Mediterranean diets on cardiovascular health and the role of gut microbiota in obesity. The findings highlight the potential of AI to tailor nutritional recommendations based on individual genetic, metabolic, and lifestyle factors, thereby enhancing disease prevention and management. The study underscores the importance of integrating AI into nutritional research to advance the field of precision nutrition and improve public health outcomes."}
