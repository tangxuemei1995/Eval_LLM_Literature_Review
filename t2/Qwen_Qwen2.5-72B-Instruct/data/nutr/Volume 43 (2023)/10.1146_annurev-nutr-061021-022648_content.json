{"Abstract": "Serine, a non-essential amino acid, plays a critical role in various metabolic pathways and has been implicated in both health and disease. This review examines the sources and sinks of serine, focusing on its interconversion with glycine and its involvement in metabolic flux. Recent metabolomics studies have highlighted the importance of serine in conditions such as diabetes and neuropathy, where altered serine metabolism can contribute to disease progression. The synthesis and catabolism of serine are tightly regulated, and disruptions in these processes can lead to metabolic imbalances. Understanding the dynamic interplay between serine and glycine metabolism is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies to address metabolic disorders. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the metabolic pathways of serine, its role in health, and its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in disease states."}
