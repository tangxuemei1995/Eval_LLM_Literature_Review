{"Abstract": "Child undernutrition, encompassing stunting and wasting, remains a significant global health issue, affecting millions of children and leading to long-term developmental and health consequences. Recent research has highlighted the critical role of the gut microbiome in the pathophysiology of undernutrition. This review synthesizes current knowledge on hostâ€“microbiome interactions in child undernutrition, emphasizing the dysbiosis observed in malnourished children. Studies have shown that the gut microbiota of undernourished children is characterized by reduced diversity, altered composition, and an immature developmental trajectory compared to healthy peers. These microbial imbalances can impair nutrient absorption, increase intestinal permeability, and trigger chronic inflammation, exacerbating the effects of undernutrition. Furthermore, interventions aimed at modulating the microbiome, such as probiotics and prebiotics, show promise in improving nutritional status and growth outcomes. Understanding the complex interplay between the host and the microbiome is essential for developing targeted therapeutic strategies to combat child undernutrition."}
