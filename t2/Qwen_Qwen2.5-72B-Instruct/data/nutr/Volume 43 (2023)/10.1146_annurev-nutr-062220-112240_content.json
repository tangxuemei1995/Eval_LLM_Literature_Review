{"Abstract": "Mammalian fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) constitute a diverse family of lipid-binding proteins that play crucial roles in intracellular lipid metabolism and transport. These proteins facilitate the solubilization and trafficking of fatty acids and other hydrophobic ligands within cells, thereby influencing various physiological processes. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of FABPs in the regulation of gene expression, inflammation, and cellular signaling pathways. Dysregulation of FABP expression and function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders, as well as in the progression of certain cancers. This review summarizes the current understanding of the multifunctional roles of FABPs in lipid metabolism and their potential as therapeutic targets for metabolic and neoplastic diseases."}
