{"Abstract": "Pregnancy imposes significant demands on maternal iron homeostasis to support fetal growth and development. This review examines the intricate regulatory mechanisms governing iron metabolism in the maternal, placental, and fetal compartments. Hepcidin, a key iron regulatory hormone, plays a crucial role in modulating iron absorption and distribution during pregnancy. The placenta acts as a dynamic interface, facilitating iron transfer from mother to fetus while also producing hepcidin to regulate local iron homeostasis. Inflammatory conditions, common in pregnancy, can alter hepcidin levels, potentially exacerbating iron deficiency. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing strategies to prevent and manage iron deficiency anemia, a prevalent complication during pregnancy that can have long-term consequences for both mother and child."}
