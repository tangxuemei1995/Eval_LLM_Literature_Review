{"Abstract": "Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has revolutionized cancer immunotherapy, yet resistance remains a significant challenge. This review elucidates the mechanisms underlying resistance to CAR T cell therapies, categorizing them into intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic resistance mechanisms include antigen loss, downregulation of co-stimulatory molecules, and exhaustion of CAR T cells, which can be driven by prolonged antigen exposure and chronic activation. Extrinsic resistance involves the tumor microenvironment, where immunosuppressive cells and cytokines, such as regulatory T cells and TGF-Î², inhibit CAR T cell function. Additionally, metabolic alterations and hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment further impede CAR T cell efficacy. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing strategies to enhance the durability and effectiveness of CAR T cell therapies, potentially through combination approaches with other immunomodulatory agents or genetic modifications to CAR T cells."}
