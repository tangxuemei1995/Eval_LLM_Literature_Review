{"Abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into computational pathology has the potential to revolutionize cancer diagnosis and treatment. This review examines the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques in the analysis of histopathological images, focusing on their impact on diagnostic workflows and clinical outcomes. Recent studies have demonstrated that AI algorithms can accurately identify and classify tumors, detect subtle histological features, and predict patient outcomes, often surpassing human pathologists in speed and precision. Moreover, AI-driven approaches have shown promise in the identification of novel biomarkers and the stratification of patients for personalized therapy. However, challenges remain, including the need for large, high-quality datasets, standardization of AI models, and the integration of AI tools into clinical practice. This paper discusses these challenges and highlights the potential of AI to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and reproducibility of cancer diagnosis, ultimately leading to better patient care."}
