{"Abstract": "Cellular senescence, characterized by a permanent cell cycle arrest, plays a dual role in cancer biology. Initially, it acts as a tumor suppressor mechanism by halting the proliferation of damaged cells. However, senescent cells can also promote tumor progression through the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and proteases, collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Therapy-induced senescence (TIS) further complicates this landscape, as it can either enhance the efficacy of cancer treatments or contribute to therapy resistance and tumor relapse. Recent advances in senolytic drugs, which selectively eliminate senescent cells, offer a promising strategy to mitigate the detrimental effects of SASP and enhance the efficacy of cancer therapies. The 'one-two punch' approach, combining senolytics with conventional treatments, represents a novel paradigm in cancer therapy, aiming to exploit the potent and paradoxical biology of cellular senescence."}
