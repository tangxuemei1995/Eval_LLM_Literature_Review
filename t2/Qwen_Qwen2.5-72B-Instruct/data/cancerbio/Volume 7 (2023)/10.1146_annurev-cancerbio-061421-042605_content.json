{"Abstract": "The intricate relationship between immune cell metabolism and immuno-oncology has emerged as a critical area of research, offering new insights into the regulation of immune responses within the tumor microenvironment. Immune cells, including T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, rely on specific metabolic pathways to function effectively. In the context of cancer, these pathways are often hijacked by tumors to suppress immune activity, promoting tumor growth and evasion. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of targeting metabolic checkpoints, such as glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and amino acid metabolism, to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies. By modulating the metabolic landscape of the tumor microenvironment, it is possible to reprogram immune cells to mount a more effective antitumor response. This review discusses the current understanding of immunometabolism in the context of immuno-oncology, highlighting key metabolic targets and therapeutic strategies that aim to improve patient outcomes in cancer treatment."}
