{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in FLASH radiotherapy (RT) have sparked a reevaluation of radiobiological principles. Unlike conventional RT, FLASH RT delivers ultrahigh dose rates, significantly sparing normal tissues while maintaining isoefficient tumor killing. This paradigm shift challenges traditional dose-rate theories and suggests a novel mechanism of action. Emerging studies indicate that the unique temporal and spatial distribution of energy in FLASH RT may alter cellular responses, reducing acute side effects and enhancing therapeutic outcomes. This review synthesizes current evidence, highlighting the potential of FLASH RT to transform clinical practice and the need for further research to elucidate underlying mechanisms and optimize treatment protocols."}
