{"Abstract": "Breast cancer remains a significant global health burden, with estrogen receptor (ER) positivity identified in approximately 70% of cases. Current therapeutic strategies, including selective ER modulators (SERMs) and selective ER degraders (SERDs), aim to disrupt ER signaling, a key driver of tumor growth. However, resistance to these treatments is a growing concern. This review highlights the latest advancements in next-generation ER-targeted therapeutics, focusing on novel SERMs and SERDs designed to overcome resistance mechanisms. These agents exhibit improved pharmacokinetic properties and enhanced receptor specificity, leading to more effective tumor suppression. Preclinical studies and early clinical trials have shown promising results, with some candidates demonstrating significant efficacy in ER-positive breast cancer models resistant to current therapies. The integration of these next-generation therapeutics into clinical practice holds the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and redefine the landscape of breast cancer treatment."}
