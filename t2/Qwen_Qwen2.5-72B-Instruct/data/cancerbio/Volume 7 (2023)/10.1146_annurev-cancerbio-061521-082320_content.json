{"Abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) NK cells represent a promising advancement in cancer immunotherapy, offering the potential for an 'off-the-shelf' product. Unlike CAR T cells, CAR NK cells can be derived from allogeneic sources, reducing the need for patient-specific customization and enabling rapid deployment. Recent studies have demonstrated their efficacy in targeting various malignancies, including hematological and solid tumors, with reduced risk of cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity. This review highlights the current state of CAR NK cell therapy, discussing recent clinical trials, manufacturing challenges, and future directions. The unique properties of NK cells, combined with the precision of CAR technology, position CAR NK cells as a transformative approach in the field of cell therapy."}
