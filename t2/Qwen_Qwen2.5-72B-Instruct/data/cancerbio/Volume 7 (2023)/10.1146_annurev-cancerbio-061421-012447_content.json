{"Abstract": "Recent studies have revealed that somatic mutations accumulate in normal tissues over time, challenging the traditional view that mutations are primarily a consequence of cancer. This review explores the role of somatic mutations in the context of stem cells and aging, highlighting their potential as early indicators of carcinogenesis. Evidence suggests that chronic exposure to carcinogens and the natural aging process can lead to an increased mutational burden in stem cells, which may predispose tissues to malignant transformation. Understanding the mechanisms by which these mutations arise and persist in normal tissues could provide new insights into cancer prevention strategies. This perspective emphasizes the importance of early intervention and the potential for developing biomarkers to identify individuals at high risk of developing cancer."}
