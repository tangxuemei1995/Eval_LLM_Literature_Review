{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in cancer biology have led to the development of innovative tools for lineage tracing in vivo, enhancing our understanding of tumor evolution and metastasis. This review highlights the integration of single-cell analysis and cell barcoding techniques, which enable the precise tracking of cellular lineages within complex tumor microenvironments. These methodologies provide unprecedented insights into the clonal dynamics and genetic heterogeneity of cancer cells, elucidating key mechanisms that drive tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. By leveraging these advanced tools, researchers can now dissect the intricate processes of cancer metastasis, offering new avenues for the development of targeted therapies and personalized treatment strategies. The application of these technologies in preclinical models and clinical settings promises to revolutionize our approach to cancer diagnosis and treatment, ultimately improving patient outcomes."}
