{"Abstract": "Combination therapies in cancer treatment are increasingly recognized for their potential to enhance efficacy and reduce resistance. This review explores the rationales for combining therapies, focusing on independent action, response correlation, collateral sensitivity, and synergy. Independent action assumes that the effects of combined drugs are additive, while response correlation suggests that the effectiveness of one drug can predict the response to another. Collateral sensitivity leverages the idea that resistance to one therapy can render cancer cells more susceptible to another. Synergy, however, involves a greater-than-additive effect, where the combined impact of two or more drugs exceeds the sum of their individual effects. Clinical trials involving PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors, for instance, have shown promising results when combined with other immunotherapies or targeted agents. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes in oncology."}
