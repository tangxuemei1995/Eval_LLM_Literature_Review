{"Abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the significance of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in the formation of biomolecular condensates, which play a crucial role in cellular processes such as transcription and signaling. In fusion oncoprotein-driven cancers, these condensates are increasingly recognized as key mediators of oncogenic activity. This review examines the current understanding of how fusion oncoproteins, often characterized by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), utilize LLPS to form functional condensates that dysregulate transcription and kinase signaling pathways. We discuss the sequence features that promote phase separation and the implications for therapeutic intervention. By targeting the biophysical properties of these condensates, novel strategies may emerge to disrupt the oncogenic functions of fusion proteins, offering promising avenues for cancer treatment."}
