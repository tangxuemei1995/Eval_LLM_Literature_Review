{"Abstract": "Intratumor heterogeneity, characterized by the presence of multiple clonal subpopulations within a tumor, poses significant challenges to cancer immunosurveillance and therapeutic interventions. This study investigates how clonal diversity influences the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition and other immunotherapies. Using a combination of genomic analysis, immune profiling, and in vivo models, we demonstrate that tumors with higher clonal heterogeneity exhibit reduced sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors. This is attributed to the emergence of immune-resistant clones and the modulation of the tumor microenvironment. Our findings highlight the importance of considering intratumor heterogeneity in the development of personalized immunotherapy strategies and suggest that combination therapies targeting both the tumor and the immune system may be necessary to overcome resistance mechanisms."}
