{"Abstract": "Adoptive cellular therapy (ACT) utilizing T cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cells represents a promising approach in cancer immunotherapy. This study focuses on targeting driver oncogenes and other public neoantigens, which are shared among multiple patients, to enhance the efficacy and specificity of TCR-based therapies. By leveraging high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics, we identified a panel of recurrent neoantigens derived from common driver mutations. TCRs specific to these neoantigens were isolated and characterized for their affinity and specificity. In preclinical models, TCR-engineered T cells demonstrated robust cytotoxic activity against tumor cells expressing the targeted neoantigens, with minimal off-target effects. Clinical trials are underway to evaluate the safety and therapeutic potential of this approach in patients with advanced solid tumors. Our findings highlight the potential of TCR-based ACT to target public neoantigens, offering a novel strategy to improve the precision and effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy."}
