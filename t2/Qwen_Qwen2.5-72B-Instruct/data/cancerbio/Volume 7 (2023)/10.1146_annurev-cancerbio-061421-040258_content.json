{"Abstract": "This review explores innovative strategies to transform immunologically cold tumors into hot tumors, enhancing the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. By modulating the tumor microenvironment, approaches such as oncolytic viruses, radiation therapy, and targeted delivery of immune stimulants are discussed. Clinical trials evaluating these combinations show promising results, with improved patient outcomes and increased immune cell infiltration. The integration of these strategies holds significant potential for advancing cancer immunotherapy."}
