{"Abstract": "Macrophages and dendritic cells, key components of the mononuclear phagocyte system, play pivotal roles in the tumor microenvironment, influencing cancer progression and therapeutic outcomes. This review elucidates the complex biology of these cells, their phenotypic plasticity, and their interactions with cancer cells and other immune cells. Macrophages can adopt pro-tumoral (M2) or anti-tumoral (M1) phenotypes, while dendritic cells are crucial for antigen presentation and the initiation of adaptive immune responses. Recent advances in therapeutic strategies, including checkpoint inhibitors, cytokine modulation, and cell-based therapies, aim to reprogram these cells to enhance anti-tumor immunity. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern the function and polarization of macrophages and dendritic cells is essential for developing more effective cancer immunotherapies. This review highlights the latest findings and discusses the potential of targeting these cells to improve patient outcomes in various cancer types."}
