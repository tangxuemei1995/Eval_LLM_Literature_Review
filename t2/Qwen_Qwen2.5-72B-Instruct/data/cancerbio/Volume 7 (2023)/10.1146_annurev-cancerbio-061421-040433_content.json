{"Abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses a significant challenge in the development of effective therapies for central nervous system (CNS) tumors. This review examines the current understanding of the BBB's structure and function, and its implications for the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of experimental cancer therapeutics. We discuss the mechanisms by which the BBB restricts the entry of therapeutic agents into the brain, including tight junctions, efflux transporters, and metabolic enzymes. Strategies to enhance drug delivery across the BBB, such as nanoparticle formulations, receptor-mediated transcytosis, and temporary disruption of the BBB, are evaluated. The review also highlights the importance of preclinical models that accurately mimic the human BBB to optimize drug development. Finally, we summarize recent advances in clinical trials targeting CNS tumors, emphasizing the need for a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the BBB and improve patient outcomes."}
