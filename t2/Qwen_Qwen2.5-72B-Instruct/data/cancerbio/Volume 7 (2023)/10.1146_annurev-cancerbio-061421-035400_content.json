{"Abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is characterized by an extensive desmoplastic reaction, which contributes to the aggressive nature of the disease. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a major component of the tumor microenvironment and play a pivotal role in this desmoplastic response. CAFs exhibit a diverse range of phenotypes and functions, contributing to tumor progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. Recent studies have highlighted the heterogeneity of CAFs, revealing distinct subpopulations with unique molecular signatures and functional properties. These subpopulations can modulate the tumor microenvironment through the secretion of growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix components, thereby influencing cancer cell behavior and immune cell infiltration. Moreover, the interaction between CAFs and other stromal components, such as immune cells and blood vessels, further complicates the tumor microenvironment. Understanding the complex interplay between CAFs and the tumor microenvironment is crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies that target the stroma and improve patient outcomes in pancreatic cancer. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the role of CAFs in pancreatic cancer, emphasizing the importance of CAF heterogeneity and the potential for targeting CAFs in combination with conventional therapies."}
