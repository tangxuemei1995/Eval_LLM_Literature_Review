{"Abstract": "The development of tumor organoids has revolutionized cancer research by providing a more physiologically relevant model compared to traditional 2D cell cultures. However, these models often lack the complexity of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), which plays a critical role in tumor progression and response to therapy. This study introduces an advanced coculture system that integrates patient-derived organoids with a diverse array of immune cells, including T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, to more accurately recapitulate the TIME. By optimizing the coculture conditions, we demonstrate enhanced immune cell infiltration and functional interactions within the organoids, leading to a more robust and dynamic model of tumor-immune interactions. This platform not only provides a valuable tool for understanding the mechanisms of immune evasion and tumor progression but also offers a promising avenue for personalized medicine, enabling the preclinical testing of immunotherapeutic strategies tailored to individual patients."}
