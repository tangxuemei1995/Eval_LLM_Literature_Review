{"Abstract": "This study provides a comprehensive analysis of cancers attributable to modifiable risk factors, emphasizing the potential for prevention. Utilizing data from multiple global health databases, we estimated the population attributable fraction (PAF) for various modifiable risk factors, including tobacco use, alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, physical inactivity, and dietary factors. Our findings indicate that a substantial proportion of cancer cases—approximately 40%—can be attributed to these modifiable factors. The highest PAFs were observed for lung cancer (attributable to smoking) and liver cancer (attributable to alcohol and obesity). We also highlight the disparities in cancer burden across different regions and socioeconomic groups, underscoring the need for tailored prevention strategies. This road map for cancer control outlines key interventions, such as policy changes, public health campaigns, and community-based programs, aimed at reducing exposure to these risk factors and ultimately lowering the incidence of avoidable cancers."}
