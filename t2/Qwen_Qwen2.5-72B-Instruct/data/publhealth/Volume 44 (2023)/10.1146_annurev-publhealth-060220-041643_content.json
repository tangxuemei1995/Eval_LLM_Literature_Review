{"Abstract": "This multidisciplinary study explores the potential of mobile technology, including wearable sensors and digital health applications, to promote public health through enhanced physical activity and health behavior change. By integrating insights from public health, behavioral science, and technology design, the research examines how culturally relevant personalized medicine can be effectively delivered to diverse populations. The study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative data from wearable sensors with qualitative feedback from user interviews, to assess the impact of mobile interventions on health outcomes. Key findings indicate that tailored, culturally sensitive mobile health interventions can significantly increase physical activity levels and improve health behaviors, particularly when supported by real-time feedback and social support mechanisms. The implications of this research highlight the importance of designing mobile health solutions that are not only technologically advanced but also culturally and contextually appropriate, to maximize their effectiveness in promoting public health."}
