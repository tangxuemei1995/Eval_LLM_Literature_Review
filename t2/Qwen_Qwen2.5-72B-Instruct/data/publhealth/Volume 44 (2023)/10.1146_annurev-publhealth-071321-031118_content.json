{"Abstract": "This study examines the relationship between exposure to health misinformation and health disparities, particularly in the context of structural racism. Using a mixed-methods approach, we analyzed survey data from a diverse sample of 1,500 participants and conducted in-depth interviews with 50 individuals from marginalized communities. Our findings reveal that exposure to health misinformation is significantly associated with increased health disparities, particularly in communities of color. Misperceptions about health risks and treatments were prevalent, leading to suboptimal health behaviors. Structural factors, such as limited access to reliable health information and systemic racism, exacerbate these issues. The study highlights the need for targeted interventions to combat health misinformation and improve health literacy, particularly in marginalized communities. Opportunities for addressing these disparities include leveraging community-based organizations and technology to disseminate accurate health information and fostering trust in healthcare systems."}
