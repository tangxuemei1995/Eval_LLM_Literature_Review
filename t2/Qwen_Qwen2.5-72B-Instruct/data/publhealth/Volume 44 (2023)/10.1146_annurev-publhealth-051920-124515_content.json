{"Abstract": "This paper explores the dynamic and evolving landscape of on-the-go adaptation of implementation approaches and strategies in the health sector. As healthcare environments become increasingly complex, the need for flexible and responsive implementation strategies has become paramount. The review synthesizes recent literature, highlighting the importance of real-time data collection, stakeholder engagement, and iterative feedback loops in facilitating adaptive implementation. Key findings indicate that successful adaptation often hinges on organizational culture, leadership support, and the integration of technology to monitor and adjust interventions. The paper also identifies emerging research opportunities, including the development of frameworks for adaptive implementation, the role of artificial intelligence in real-time decision-making, and the impact of adaptive strategies on long-term health outcomes. These insights provide a foundation for future research and practical applications aimed at enhancing the effectiveness and sustainability of health interventions."}
