{"Abstract": "Extreme heat events, exacerbated by climate change, pose significant public health risks, necessitating robust preparedness strategies. This review synthesizes current literature on public health preparedness for extreme heat, focusing on the development and implementation of heat action plans (HAPs) as a key disaster risk reduction measure. HAPs integrate early warning systems, community education, and targeted interventions to protect vulnerable populations. The analysis highlights the importance of multi-sector collaboration, including meteorological services, healthcare providers, and local governments, to enhance the effectiveness of these plans. Case studies from urban and rural settings demonstrate the adaptability of HAPs to diverse contexts, emphasizing the need for context-specific strategies. The findings underscore the critical role of continuous evaluation and community engagement in improving public health outcomes during extreme heat events."}
