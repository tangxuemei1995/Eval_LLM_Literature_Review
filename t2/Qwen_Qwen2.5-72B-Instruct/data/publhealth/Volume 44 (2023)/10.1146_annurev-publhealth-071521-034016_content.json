{"Abstract": "This paper examines the intersection of public health and the prison system in the context of mass incarceration. It highlights the critical role of correctional health in addressing the physical and mental health needs of incarcerated individuals, many of whom suffer from chronic conditions and substance use disorders. The paper argues that decarceration, alongside improved health services within prisons, is essential for reducing health disparities and promoting public safety. By integrating public health principles into correctional policies, the paper proposes strategies to mitigate the adverse health outcomes associated with incarceration and to support successful reintegration into society. The findings underscore the need for a comprehensive approach that prioritizes both the well-being of incarcerated individuals and the broader community."}
