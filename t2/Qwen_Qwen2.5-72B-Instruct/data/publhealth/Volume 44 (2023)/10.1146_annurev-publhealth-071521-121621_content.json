{"Abstract": "Accurate assessment of food and nutrient intake is crucial for advancing nutritional epidemiology and population sciences. This review synthesizes current methodologies and emerging techniques to enhance the capacity for dietary assessment, focusing on the integration of nutritional biomarkers and advanced statistical methods such as regression calibration to address measurement error. We discuss the limitations of traditional self-reported dietary data and highlight the role of biomarkers in validating and improving the accuracy of intake estimates. The application of these methods in large-scale population studies is explored, emphasizing the need for standardized protocols and interdisciplinary collaboration. This comprehensive approach aims to refine our understanding of dietary patterns and their impact on health outcomes, ultimately informing public health policies and interventions."}
