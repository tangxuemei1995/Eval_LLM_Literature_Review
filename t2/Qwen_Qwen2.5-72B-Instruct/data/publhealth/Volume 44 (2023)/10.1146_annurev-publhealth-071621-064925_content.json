{"Abstract": "This review examines the evolution of environmental justice (EJ) as a field, focusing on its historical roots, key milestones, and current challenges. Environmental justice emerged in response to the disproportionate exposure of marginalized communities, particularly racial and ethnic minorities, to environmental hazards. The paper highlights the role of environmental racism and structural inequalities in perpetuating racial health disparities. Through a comprehensive analysis of case studies and policy interventions, the review identifies critical areas for future research and action, including the need for more inclusive health advocacy and activism. The discussion underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches and community engagement in addressing the complex intersections of race, environment, and health. As EJ continues to evolve, the paper calls for a renewed commitment to dismantling systemic barriers and advancing equitable environmental policies."}
