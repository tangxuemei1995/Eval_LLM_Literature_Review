{"Abstract": "This critical review examines the public health implications of drought in the context of climate change, focusing on emerging trends, human health impacts, and vulnerability factors. The review synthesizes findings from a wide range of studies, highlighting the increasing frequency and severity of droughts and their direct and indirect effects on human health, including waterborne diseases, malnutrition, and mental health disorders. The analysis also explores the role of socioeconomic and environmental factors in exacerbating vulnerability and the importance of integrated drought risk management strategies. Key recommendations include enhancing early warning systems, improving water resource management, and strengthening community resilience to mitigate the adverse health outcomes associated with drought in a changing climate."}
