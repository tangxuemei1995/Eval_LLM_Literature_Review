{"Abstract": "This study explores the differential impact of necessity versus choice on physical activity levels in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, we analyzed survey data from 12,000 participants across 10 LMICs, complemented by in-depth interviews and focus groups. Our findings indicate that while active transport (e.g., walking, cycling) is often driven by necessity due to limited access to motorized transport, it contributes significantly to overall physical activity levels. However, the quality and safety of active transport infrastructure vary widely, affecting the sustainability and health benefits of these activities. We also identified a positive correlation between perceived choice in physical activity and higher levels of engagement, suggesting that promoting voluntary, enjoyable activities could enhance public health outcomes. Policy recommendations include improving infrastructure for safe and accessible active transport and integrating culturally relevant physical activity programs to address health equity and social justice. This research underscores the importance of context-specific interventions to promote physical activity in LMICs, contributing to global health efforts."}
