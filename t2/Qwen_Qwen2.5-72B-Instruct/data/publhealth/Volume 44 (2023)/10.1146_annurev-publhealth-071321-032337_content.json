{"Abstract": "This study explores the multifaceted impacts of early childhood education (ECE) on health outcomes, equity, and economic benefits. Drawing from a comprehensive review of longitudinal studies and economic analyses, the research highlights how high-quality ECE programs can significantly improve cognitive and socio-emotional development, leading to better health outcomes in later life. The study also examines the role of ECE in reducing educational disparities among disadvantaged populations, thereby promoting social equity. Economic models suggest that investments in ECE yield substantial returns, not only in terms of individual earnings but also in reduced healthcare costs and increased societal productivity. The findings underscore the critical importance of policy support for ECE as a strategic intervention to enhance both individual and collective well-being."}
