{"Abstract": "This review synthesizes current evidence on the impact of housing quality on health and well-being inequalities. A comprehensive analysis of studies reveals that substandard housing conditions, including poor indoor air quality, dampness, and inadequate thermal comfort, disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, exacerbating health disparities. The review highlights the importance of healthy housing guidelines and policies that address these issues, emphasizing the cobenefits of improved housing quality, such as reduced healthcare costs and enhanced social cohesion. Key findings indicate that interventions aimed at upgrading housing infrastructure can lead to significant improvements in physical and mental health outcomes, particularly among low-income and marginalized communities. The evidence supports the need for multidisciplinary approaches that integrate public health, urban planning, and social policy to create healthier living environments and reduce health inequalities."}
