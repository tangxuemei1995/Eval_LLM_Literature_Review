{"Abstract": "This study explores the complex interplay between climatic and environmental changes, migration, and health outcomes. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we analyze how climate-induced environmental degradation and extreme weather events drive human mobility, including both short-term displacement and long-term relocation. The research highlights the health vulnerabilities of migrant populations, particularly in terms of mental health, infectious diseases, and access to healthcare services. Case studies from various regions, including low-lying coastal areas and arid regions, illustrate the diverse impacts of climate change on migration patterns and health. The findings underscore the need for integrated policies that address both the environmental and social determinants of health in the context of climate-induced migration."}
