{"Abstract": "Gentrification, a complex urban phenomenon, often leads to displacement and exacerbates health inequities in affected communities. This paper presents a theoretical and methodological guide to understanding and mitigating the adverse health effects of gentrification. By integrating concepts from urban sociology, public health, and urban planning, we propose a framework that identifies key mechanisms through which gentrification impacts health, including changes in housing stability, social networks, and access to resources. We also outline methodological approaches for assessing these impacts, emphasizing the importance of community engagement and longitudinal studies. The guide aims to equip researchers, policymakers, and community organizations with the tools necessary to promote health equity in the context of urban regeneration, ensuring that the benefits of neighborhood improvements are shared equitably among all residents."}
