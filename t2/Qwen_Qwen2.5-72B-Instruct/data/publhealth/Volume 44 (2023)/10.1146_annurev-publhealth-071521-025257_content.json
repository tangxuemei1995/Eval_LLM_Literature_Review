{"Abstract": "This study examines the multifaceted impacts of paid family and medical leave (PFML) on worker health, family well-being, and employer outcomes. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from the United States, the analysis reveals that PFML significantly improves mental and physical health among workers, particularly new parents and caregivers. The findings indicate a reduction in stress levels, enhanced recovery from medical conditions, and improved child and family health outcomes. Additionally, PFML is associated with higher job satisfaction, reduced turnover rates, and increased employee productivity, suggesting that the policy benefits extend beyond individual health to organizational performance. However, the study also highlights potential challenges, such as the financial burden on small businesses and the need for equitable access to leave. Overall, the results support the implementation of PFML as a critical component of a supportive social policy framework."}
