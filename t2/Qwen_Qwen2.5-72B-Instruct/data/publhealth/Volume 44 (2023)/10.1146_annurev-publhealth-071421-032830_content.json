{"Abstract": "This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the US public health workforce, highlighting ongoing challenges and proposing future directions. Despite the critical role of public health professionals in addressing public health emergencies and promoting community health, the workforce faces significant issues related to recruitment, retention, and training. The study synthesizes data from multiple sources, including national surveys and state-level reports, to enumerate the workforce and assess its composition, distribution, and competencies. Key findings indicate a shortage of qualified professionals, particularly in rural and underserved areas, and a need for enhanced training programs to address emerging public health threats. Recommendations include the development of targeted recruitment strategies, the implementation of supportive retention policies, and the expansion of workforce development initiatives to ensure a robust and resilient public health workforce for the future."}
