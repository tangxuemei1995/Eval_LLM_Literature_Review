{"Abstract": "This literature review synthesizes current evidence on the impact of air pollution on COVID-19 health outcomes, highlighting statistical challenges and the role of data visualization in enhancing understanding. Studies from various regions indicate that exposure to particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is associated with increased severity and mortality of COVID-19. However, methodological inconsistencies, confounding factors, and temporal lags complicate the interpretation of these findings. Advanced data visualization techniques, such as geographic heat maps and interactive dashboards, are crucial for communicating complex relationships and trends. This review underscores the need for standardized methodologies and integrated data platforms to support robust evidence synthesis and inform public health policies."}
