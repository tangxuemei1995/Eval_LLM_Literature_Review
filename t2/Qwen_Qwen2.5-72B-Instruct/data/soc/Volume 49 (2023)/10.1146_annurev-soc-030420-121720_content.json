{"Abstract": "This study examines the dynamics of diasporic mobilization and state responses in the context of cross-border politics. Drawing on a comparative analysis of emigrant communities from several conflict-affected regions, the research highlights how diasporas engage in transnational activities that influence geopolitical relations between their host and homeland countries. The study reveals that diasporic groups often leverage their political, economic, and social resources to advocate for their interests, which can range from promoting peace and reconciliation to supporting nationalist agendas. State responses to these activities are varied, with some governments fostering dialogue and cooperation, while others adopt more restrictive measures. The findings underscore the complex interplay between diaspora activism and state policies, suggesting that understanding these dynamics is crucial for addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by transnationalism in the 21st century."}
