{"Abstract": "This study examines the 'diverging destinies' thesis in the context of East Asia, focusing on how family structures, gender roles, and economic inequality impact the life trajectories of children. Drawing on longitudinal data from China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, the research reveals that children from more affluent and stable family backgrounds tend to have better educational and health outcomes, reinforcing existing social inequalities. Gender dynamics further complicate these patterns, with girls often facing unique challenges in educational attainment and career opportunities. The findings highlight the need for targeted policies to address the widening gap in child well-being and to promote more equitable family environments across the region."}
