{"Abstract": "This paper explores the social construction of age, emphasizing the dynamic interplay between individual life courses and broader social structures. By integrating concepts from intersectionality and stratification, we examine how age is not merely a biological marker but a socially constructed category that intersects with other axes of identity such as gender, race, and class. The methodology section outlines innovative approaches to measuring age, including qualitative and quantitative methods that capture the multifaceted nature of aging. Drawing on recent demographic data, we argue that a nuanced understanding of age requires a holistic approach that considers the diverse experiences and trajectories of individuals. This research contributes to the broader field of demography by highlighting the importance of context and intersectionality in the study of aging."}
