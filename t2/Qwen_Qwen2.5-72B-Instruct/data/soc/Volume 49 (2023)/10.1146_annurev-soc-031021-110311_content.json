{"Abstract": "This study introduces a novel framework for examining the interplay between neighborhood and school contexts, termed 'Neighborhoodâ€“School Structures.' By integrating data from multiple urban areas, we explore how these structures influence educational outcomes and social mobility. The analysis reveals that the combination of neighborhood and school characteristics, such as socioeconomic status, racial composition, and resource availability, significantly affects student achievement and opportunities. The findings highlight the importance of considering both contexts simultaneously to understand the mechanisms of segregation and the cumulative effects of social environments. This approach offers a more nuanced understanding of how social contexts shape individual trajectories and suggests policy implications for addressing disparities in educational and social outcomes."}
