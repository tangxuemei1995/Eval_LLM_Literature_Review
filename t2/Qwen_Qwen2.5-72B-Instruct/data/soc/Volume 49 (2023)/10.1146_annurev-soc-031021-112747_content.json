{"Abstract": "This paper explores the multifaceted relationship between food systems and social inequality, emphasizing the intersections of agriculture, food access, and justice. Drawing on a comprehensive review of recent literature, the study highlights how structural inequalities in the agricultural sector perpetuate disparities in food access and nutrition, particularly among marginalized communities. The concept of food sovereignty is examined as a critical framework for addressing these inequalities, promoting the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods. The paper also integrates an intersectional analysis, considering how race, gender, and socioeconomic status intersect to shape experiences of food insecurity. Case studies from diverse global contexts illustrate the complexities and potential solutions in achieving food justice. The findings underscore the need for policy interventions that address the root causes of inequality in food systems, advocating for a more equitable and sustainable approach to food production and distribution."}
