{"Abstract": "This study explores the spatial-contextual dimensions of policing and punishment within the criminal legal system, emphasizing the role of place in shaping outcomes. By integrating geographic information systems (GIS) with qualitative and quantitative data, the research examines how urban, suburban, and rural environments influence police practices, sentencing decisions, and recidivism rates. Findings reveal significant disparities in law enforcement activities and judicial responses across different spatial contexts, highlighting the need for place-based policies to address systemic inequalities. The study underscores the importance of considering local social, economic, and cultural factors in the development of more equitable and effective criminal justice interventions."}
