{"Abstract": "This paper explores the application of Critical Race Theory (CRT) in understanding and dismantling white privilege. By examining the historical and contemporary manifestations of whiteness, the study highlights how CRT provides a framework for confronting and challenging systemic racial inequalities. Through a critical analysis of educational, legal, and social policies, the research underscores the importance of recognizing and addressing the ways in which white privilege perpetuates racial disparities. The paper argues that a rethinking of whiteness is essential for fostering equitable and inclusive societies, and it offers practical recommendations for educators, policymakers, and community leaders to implement CRT principles in their work."}
