{"Abstract": "This study examines the multifaceted dimensions of land inequalities in the United States, focusing on disparities between urban and rural areas. By integrating economic, environmental, and legal perspectives, the research highlights how property ownership and land use policies contribute to economic stratification and environmental degradation. The analysis reveals that urban areas often experience concentrated wealth and development, while rural regions face challenges such as land abandonment and limited access to resources. Legal frameworks, including zoning laws and property rights, are found to exacerbate these inequalities by favoring certain groups and industries. The findings underscore the need for comprehensive policy reforms to address the root causes of land inequalities and promote equitable development across different landscapes."}
