{"Abstract": "This study explores the mechanisms that transform weak ties into strong ones within social networks, emphasizing the interplay between structural and agentic factors. Using a combination of computational social science methods and network analysis, we examine how bridging ties facilitate the diffusion of resources and information, leading to the strengthening of initially weak connections. Our findings suggest that the frequency and quality of interactions, along with the strategic positioning of individuals within the network, are crucial in this transformation. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the dynamics of social networks and the role of weak ties in fostering social cohesion and innovation."}
