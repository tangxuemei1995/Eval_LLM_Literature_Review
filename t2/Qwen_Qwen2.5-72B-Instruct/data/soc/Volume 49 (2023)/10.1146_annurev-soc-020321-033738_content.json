{"Abstract": "This paper explores the legacies and prospects of ethnomethodology, a sociological approach that investigates the methods people use to make sense of their social world. Originating in the 1960s, ethnomethodology has significantly influenced various fields, including conversation analysis, studies of science, and organizational studies. The paper begins by tracing the historical development of ethnomethodology, highlighting key figures such as Harold Garfinkel and their foundational works. It then examines how ethnomethodology has evolved, particularly through its integration with conversation analysis, which focuses on the detailed examination of talk-in-interaction. The paper also discusses the application of ethnomethodological principles in studies of science, where researchers have explored how scientific practices and knowledge are constructed through everyday interactions. In organizational and workplace studies, ethnomethodology has provided insights into how employees manage tasks, coordinate activities, and adhere to organizational rules. The concept of 'instructed action' is central to this, as it elucidates how individuals interpret and execute instructions in specific contexts. The paper concludes by considering the future prospects of ethnomethodology, suggesting that its methods and theories can be further applied to emerging areas such as digital communication and virtual organizations, thereby continuing to enrich our understanding of social life."}
