{"Abstract": "This paper traces a 60-year intellectual journey in the field of comparative political economy, focusing on the evolution of concepts such as embedded autonomy, dependent development, and state-society synergy. The narrative begins with the early exploration of developmental states and their role in fostering economic growth, particularly in East Asia. Over time, the analysis shifts to the challenges posed by globalization, leading to the development of the concept of counter-hegemonic globalization. This shift is marked by the emergence of transnational advocacy networks and their impact on global governance. The paper also reflects on the authorâ€™s personal experiences and the broader academic debates that have shaped the understanding of these phenomena, providing a unique perspective on the interplay between state and society in the context of global economic and political dynamics."}
