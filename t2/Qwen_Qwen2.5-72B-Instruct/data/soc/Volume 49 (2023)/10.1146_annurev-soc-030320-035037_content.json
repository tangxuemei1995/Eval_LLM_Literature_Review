{"Abstract": "This paper explores the multifaceted concept of the legitimacy of science, examining how scientific knowledge is perceived and valued in contemporary society. The increasing polarization of public opinion on scientific issues, such as climate change and vaccination, highlights the complex interplay between scientific legitimacy and cultural values. Through a review of recent literature, this study identifies key factors that influence public trust in science, including the role of media, education, and political discourse. It also discusses the implications of declining scientific legitimacy for public policy, emphasizing the need for effective communication strategies to bridge the gap between scientific consensus and public understanding. The findings suggest that fostering a culture of scientific literacy and engagement is crucial for maintaining the legitimacy of science in a diverse and often skeptical public sphere."}
