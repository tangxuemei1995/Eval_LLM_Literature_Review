{"Abstract": "This paper explores the contrasting conceptualizations of race through the lenses of essentialism and constructivism. Essentialist perspectives posit that race is a fixed, biologically determined category, underpinned by inherent and unchanging characteristics. In contrast, constructivist views argue that race is a socially constructed concept, shaped by historical, cultural, and political contexts. The paper reviews empirical studies and theoretical frameworks that highlight the implications of these differing beliefs on social attitudes, policies, and individual identities. By examining the nuances and intersections of essentialist and constructivist paradigms, this research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how racial concepts are formed and perpetuated in contemporary society."}
