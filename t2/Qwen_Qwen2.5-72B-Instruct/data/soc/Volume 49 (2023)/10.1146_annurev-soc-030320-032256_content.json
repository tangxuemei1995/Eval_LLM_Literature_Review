{"Abstract": "This study explores the evolving landscape of LGBTQ+ identities, emphasizing the intersectionality of sexual and gender identities across the life course. By analyzing qualitative data from a diverse sample of sexual minorities, we highlight the complexities and nuances of identity formation and expression. Our findings suggest that traditional binary frameworks are insufficient to capture the rich diversity of experiences within the LGBTQ+ community. We propose a more inclusive model that acknowledges the fluidity and multiplicity of sexual and gender identities, and the ways in which these intersect with other social categories such as race, class, and disability. This research underscores the importance of adopting a life course perspective to understand the dynamic and context-dependent nature of LGBTQ+ identities."}
