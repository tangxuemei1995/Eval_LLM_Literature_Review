{"Abstract": "This study examines the pervasive social inequalities within the high-tech industry, focusing on the intersections of gender, race, and ethnicity. Drawing on a comprehensive analysis of organizational structures, workplace dynamics, and venture capital funding patterns, the research reveals significant disparities in career advancement, compensation, and entrepreneurial support. Women and underrepresented racial and ethnic groups face systemic barriers that limit their access to key resources and opportunities, perpetuating a cycle of inequality. The findings highlight the need for targeted interventions and policy reforms to address these structural issues and promote a more inclusive and equitable high-tech sector. Implications for organizational practices and future research are discussed."}
