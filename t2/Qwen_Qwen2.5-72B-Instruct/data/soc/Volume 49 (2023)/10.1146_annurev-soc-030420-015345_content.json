{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in the integration of causal inference and machine learning have opened new avenues for understanding complex systems and making robust predictions. This review highlights key developments, including the use of counterfactual frameworks to estimate treatment effect heterogeneity, which allows for more personalized interventions. Mediation analysis has been enhanced through machine learning techniques, enabling a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which treatments exert their effects. Additionally, the challenge of extrapolation and ensuring external validity has been addressed by leveraging domain adaptation and transfer learning methods, which help in generalizing causal findings across different populations and settings. These advancements not only improve the accuracy and reliability of causal estimates but also broaden the applicability of causal inference in fields such as healthcare, economics, and social sciences."}
