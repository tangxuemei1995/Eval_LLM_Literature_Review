{"Abstract": "This study examines the social impacts of supply-side decarbonization strategies, focusing on the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, including quantitative analysis of employment data and qualitative interviews with stakeholders, the research highlights the economic and social challenges and opportunities associated with decarbonization. Key findings indicate that while job losses in the fossil fuel sector are inevitable, targeted policies can facilitate a just transition by creating new employment opportunities in renewable energy and related industries. The study also underscores the importance of community engagement and support mechanisms to address the socio-economic disparities that may arise. Policy recommendations include investment in retraining programs, infrastructure development, and social safety nets to ensure that the benefits of decarbonization are equitably distributed. This research contributes to the broader discourse on climate change mitigation and sustainable development, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach to energy transition."}
