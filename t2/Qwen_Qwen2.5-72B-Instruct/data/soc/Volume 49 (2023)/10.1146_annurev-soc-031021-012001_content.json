{"Abstract": "Social isolation, a significant public health concern, disproportionately affects certain demographic groups, exacerbating health disparities. This review synthesizes current literature to explore how social isolation varies across the life course and is influenced by gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and socioeconomic status. Findings indicate that older adults, racial and ethnic minorities, individuals with lower socioeconomic status, and those identifying as LGBTQ+ are at heightened risk of social isolation. Gender differences also emerge, with women more likely to experience social isolation in later life, while men face higher risks during mid-adulthood. The cumulative impact of these factors throughout the life course further compounds the adverse health outcomes associated with social isolation, including increased mortality, mental health issues, and chronic diseases. Addressing these disparities requires targeted interventions and policies that account for the intersecting dimensions of social identity and life stage."}
