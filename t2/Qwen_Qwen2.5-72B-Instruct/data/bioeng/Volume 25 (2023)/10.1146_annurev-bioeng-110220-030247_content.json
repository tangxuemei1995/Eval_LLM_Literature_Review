{"Abstract": "This study explores the development and application of predictive models using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to forecast health deterioration and understand disease pathways, aiming to advance personalized medicine. By leveraging time series analysis and digital health pathways, the research identifies key biomarkers and clinical indicators that correlate with disease progression. The models, trained on a diverse dataset of patient records, demonstrate high accuracy in predicting adverse health events, enabling early intervention and tailored therapeutic strategies. The integration of these predictive tools into clinical practice has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. The findings highlight the importance of continuous monitoring and the dynamic nature of disease trajectories, underscoring the need for adaptive and patient-specific approaches in medical care."}
