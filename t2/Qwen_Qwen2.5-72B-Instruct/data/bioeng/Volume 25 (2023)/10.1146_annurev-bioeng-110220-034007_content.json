{"Abstract": "This review highlights recent advancements in analytical techniques for the biochemical analysis of lipids at the single-cell level. Techniques such as mass spectrometry, Raman imaging, capillary electrophoresis, and thin layer chromatography have been adapted and optimized to provide high-resolution, quantitative data on lipid composition and distribution within individual cells. Mass spectrometry, in particular, has emerged as a powerful tool due to its high sensitivity and ability to identify a wide range of lipid species. Raman imaging offers non-destructive, label-free visualization of lipid structures, while capillary electrophoresis and thin layer chromatography provide complementary methods for separating and quantifying lipids with high precision. These techniques are crucial for understanding cellular heterogeneity and the role of lipids in various physiological and pathological processes."}
