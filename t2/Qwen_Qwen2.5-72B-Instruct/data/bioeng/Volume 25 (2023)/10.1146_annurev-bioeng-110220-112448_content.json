{"Abstract": "The integration of bioelectronic sensor nodes into the Internet of Bodies (IoB) represents a significant advancement in the convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and biotechnology. These sensor nodes, equipped with advanced biosensors, enable real-time monitoring of physiological parameters, facilitating applications in healthcare, fitness, and environmental exposure. In-sensor analytics and on-board computation capabilities enhance the efficiency and responsiveness of these devices, reducing the need for continuous data transmission and thereby conserving power. Communication protocols are optimized for low-power, high-reliability data transfer, ensuring secure and seamless integration with existing IoT infrastructures. Security measures, including encryption and authentication, are critical to protect sensitive personal health data. Powering these devices remains a challenge, but recent advancements in energy harvesting and low-power design are paving the way for sustainable and long-lasting operation. This review explores the current state of bioelectronic sensor nodes, highlighting key technological innovations and addressing the challenges and future directions in the field of IoB."}
