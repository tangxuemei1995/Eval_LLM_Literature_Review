{"Abstract": "Photoacoustic (PA) imaging, a non-invasive and non-ionizing modality, has emerged as a promising technique for the characterization of bone in medical applications. This review provides an overview of the current state of PA imaging in bone research, highlighting its ability to provide high-resolution images and quantitative information. Key applications include the assessment of bone density, microstructure, and composition, as well as the monitoring of bone diseases such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. Spectral unmixing techniques are discussed for their potential to enhance the specificity of PA signals, enabling the differentiation of bone from surrounding tissues. The integration of PA imaging with quantitative ultrasound further enhances the diagnostic capabilities, offering a comprehensive approach to bone health assessment. Future directions and challenges in the clinical translation of PA imaging for bone are also outlined, emphasizing the need for standardized protocols and advanced image processing algorithms."}
