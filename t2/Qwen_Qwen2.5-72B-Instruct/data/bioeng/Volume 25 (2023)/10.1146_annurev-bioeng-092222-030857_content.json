{"Abstract": "This review highlights the importance of considering sex as a biological variable in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Sexual dimorphism in stem cell behavior, tissue responses, and disease pathophysiology underscores the need for sex-specific approaches in developing tissue models and therapeutic strategies. Evidence from recent studies indicates that sex differences influence the efficacy and safety of regenerative therapies, emphasizing the potential of precision medicine to address these variations. Integrating sex characteristics into experimental designs and clinical trials can enhance the translational potential of tissue engineering, leading to more effective and personalized treatments."}
