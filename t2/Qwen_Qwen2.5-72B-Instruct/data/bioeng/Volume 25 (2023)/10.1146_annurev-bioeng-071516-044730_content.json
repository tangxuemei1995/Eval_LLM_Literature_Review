{"Abstract": "Label-free optical metabolic imaging (OMI) has emerged as a powerful tool for non-invasively monitoring metabolic processes in cells and tissues. This technique leverages the intrinsic autofluorescence of key metabolic coenzymes, such as NADH and FAD, to provide real-time insights into cellular redox states and metabolic pathways. By combining multiphoton microscopy with fluorescence lifetime imaging, OMI can distinguish between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, offering a high-resolution map of metabolic activity. This approach has been applied to study a wide range of biological processes, from cancer metabolism to neurodegeneration, and has the potential to advance our understanding of metabolic dysregulation in disease. The ability to perform label-free, dynamic imaging of metabolic processes makes OMI a valuable tool for both basic research and clinical applications."}
