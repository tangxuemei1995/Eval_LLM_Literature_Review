{"Abstract": "Epitranscriptional modifications, collectively known as the epitranscriptome, play a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression and cellular function. In the context of cardiovascular bioengineering, these modifications, particularly those affecting RNA molecules, have emerged as critical regulators of cardiovascular development, homeostasis, and disease. This review highlights recent advances in understanding how specific RNA modifications, such as N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and 5-methylcytosine (m5C), influence cardiovascular gene regulation. We discuss the implications of these modifications in cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and heart failure, and explore the potential of targeting the epitranscriptome for therapeutic intervention. By integrating insights from molecular biology and bioengineering, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the epitranscriptome's role in cardiovascular health and disease, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies."}
