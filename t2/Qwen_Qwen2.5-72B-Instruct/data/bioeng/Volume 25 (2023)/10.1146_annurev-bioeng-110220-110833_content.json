{"Abstract": "This study investigates the role of neural plasticity in sensorimotor brainâ€“machine interfaces (BMIs). By integrating sensory and motor neural circuits, BMIs facilitate adaptive learning and functional recovery. We explore how plasticity mechanisms enable the reorganization of neural networks in response to BMI training, enhancing motor control and sensory feedback. Our findings highlight the importance of bidirectional communication in BMIs for optimizing neural adaptation and improving user performance. These insights have implications for the development of more effective therapeutic BMIs for neurological disorders."}
