{"Abstract": "This paper provides an overview of human- and equity-centered approaches in the design of health technologies, emphasizing the importance of contextual investigation and stakeholder engagement. Traditional design processes often focus narrowly on the technical aspects of devices, overlooking the broader social, cultural, and economic contexts in which they will be used. By integrating human-centered design principles, which prioritize user needs and experiences, and equity-centered engineering, which seeks to address and mitigate disparities, this approach ensures that health technologies are not only effective but also accessible and inclusive. The paper highlights the critical role of community engagement in the design process, advocating for the active participation of diverse stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers, and community leaders. Through case studies and best practices, the paper demonstrates how these approaches can lead to more sustainable and impactful health solutions, ultimately improving health outcomes for all populations."}
