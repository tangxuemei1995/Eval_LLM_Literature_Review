{"Abstract": "Dehydration is a significant health concern, particularly in vulnerable populations such as the elderly and athletes. This review evaluates the current state of noninvasive hydration monitoring technologies, including wearable devices and medical sensors. Despite advancements, challenges remain in achieving accurate and reliable hydration status assessments. Studies have shown that bioimpedance analysis and near-infrared spectroscopy hold promise, but their performance varies across different populations and environmental conditions. Moreover, the integration of these technologies into user-friendly, continuous monitoring systems is still in its infancy. Future research should focus on validating these methods across diverse groups and improving the sensitivity and specificity of hydration markers. The development of a robust, noninvasive dehydration detection tool is crucial for early intervention and prevention of dehydration-related complications."}
