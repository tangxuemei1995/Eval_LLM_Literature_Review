{"Abstract": "Hemolysis, the rupture of red blood cells, releases hemoglobin, heme, and iron into the circulation, leading to oxidative stress and tissue damage. This study explores the engineering of therapeutics to detoxify these harmful byproducts. We focus on enhancing the natural scavenging proteins haptoglobin and hemopexin, which bind hemoglobin and heme, respectively, to prevent their toxic effects. Through protein engineering and conjugation with iron chelators, we have developed novel constructs that exhibit increased affinity and stability. In vitro and in vivo assays demonstrate the efficacy of these engineered therapeutics in reducing oxidative damage and improving outcomes in hemolytic disorders. This work paves the way for new therapeutic strategies to manage conditions associated with hemolysis, such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia."}
