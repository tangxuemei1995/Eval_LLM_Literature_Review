{"Abstract": "Chronic pain, a debilitating condition affecting millions, remains a significant challenge in pain management. This review explores the latest advancements in neurotechnology, focusing on deep brain stimulation (DBS), spinal cord stimulation (SCS), and transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS). These interventions target the peripheral nervous system and central pain pathways to modulate pain signals. DBS, by stimulating specific brain regions, has shown promise in treating refractory chronic pain conditions. SCS, which involves the placement of electrodes in the epidural space of the spinal cord, has been effective in managing neuropathic pain. TENS, a non-invasive technique, delivers electrical impulses to peripheral nerves, providing analgesic effects. This paper synthesizes clinical outcomes, safety profiles, and patient selection criteria for these neurotechnological approaches, highlighting their potential to transform pain management practices and improve quality of life for chronic pain sufferers."}
