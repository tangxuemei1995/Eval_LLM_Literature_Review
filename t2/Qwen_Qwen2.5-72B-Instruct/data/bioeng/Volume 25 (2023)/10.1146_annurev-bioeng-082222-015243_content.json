{"Abstract": "This study explores the development of engineered compounds designed to control ice nucleation and recrystallization, processes critical in various industrial and biological applications. Inspired by natural antifreeze (glyco)proteins, these compounds exhibit enhanced thermal hysteresis, effectively lowering the freezing point and inhibiting ice crystal growth. Through a combination of molecular design and experimental validation, we demonstrate that these engineered compounds can significantly reduce ice nucleation rates and prevent recrystallization, offering promising solutions for cryopreservation, food storage, and materials science."}
