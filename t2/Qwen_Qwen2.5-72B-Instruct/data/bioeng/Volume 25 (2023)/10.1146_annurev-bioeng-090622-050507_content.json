{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in the development of penetrating neural electrodes have significantly enhanced our ability to record neural activity at high spatial and temporal resolutions. This review focuses on the emerging technologies that aim to achieve large-scale and long-term stable recordings, crucial for both basic neuroscience research and clinical applications. Key innovations include the use of flexible and biocompatible materials, novel microfabrication techniques, and advanced signal processing algorithms. These advancements address the critical challenges of minimizing tissue damage, reducing immune responses, and maintaining electrode functionality over extended periods. Studies have demonstrated the potential of these electrodes in chronic implantation, enabling the continuous monitoring of neural circuits and the development of more effective neuroprosthetic devices. Future directions will likely involve further integration of these technologies with machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance data interpretation and therapeutic outcomes."}
