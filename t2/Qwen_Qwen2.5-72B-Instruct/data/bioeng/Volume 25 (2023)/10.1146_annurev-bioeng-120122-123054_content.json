{"Abstract": "Aging is a complex biological process characterized by the progressive decline in physiological function and increased susceptibility to age-related diseases. Recent advancements in understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of aging have led to the development of novel anti-aging strategies. This review highlights current trends in anti-aging research, focusing on interventions that target biological clocks, cellular senescence, and progeria. Emerging evidence suggests that modulating circadian rhythms and telomere length can delay aging and improve healthspan. Additionally, the clearance of senescent cells through senolytics and the enhancement of cellular rejuvenation pathways are promising approaches. Studies on progeria, a premature aging syndrome, have provided insights into the genetic and epigenetic factors that contribute to accelerated aging. These findings underscore the potential of personalized anti-aging therapies and highlight the importance of a multifaceted approach to combat aging and promote healthy longevity."}
