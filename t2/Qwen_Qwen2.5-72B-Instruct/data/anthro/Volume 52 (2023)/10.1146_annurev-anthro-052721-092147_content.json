{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of linguistic anthropology and visual semiotics, focusing on how images function as linguistic entities within social contexts. By examining processes of entextualization, performativity, and enregisterment, the research elucidates how images are imbued with meaning and how they participate in the construction of social realities. Through a series of case studies, the paper demonstrates how images can be analyzed as texts, highlighting their role in communication and cultural practices. The findings contribute to a broader understanding of the semiotic landscape, where visual and linguistic elements are interwoven in complex ways, shaping human interaction and identity."}
