{"Abstract": "This paper revisits the anthropology of masculinity, a field that has evolved significantly since its inception. By examining the ways in which masculinity is constructed, performed, and negotiated across diverse cultural contexts, the study highlights the dynamic and multifaceted nature of male identities. It explores the intersections of masculinity with other social categories such as race, class, and sexuality, and how these intersections contribute to patterns of inequality and power. The research also addresses the ongoing changes in gender norms and the implications of these shifts for menâ€™s roles and relationships. Through a critical analysis of contemporary ethnographic data, the paper argues for a more nuanced understanding of masculinity that recognizes both its fluidity and its impact on broader social structures. This re-examination aims to contribute to the broader discourse on gender equality and social change."}
