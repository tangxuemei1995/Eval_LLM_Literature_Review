{"Abstract": "This study explores the invisible labor and ethical dimensions of interpreting within the frameworks of global capitalism and humanitarian regimes. Drawing on qualitative data from interviews with professional interpreters, the research highlights the often-overlooked emotional and cognitive efforts required in the profession. Interpreters navigate complex linguistic and cultural landscapes, mediating not only words but also the nuanced meanings and power dynamics inherent in their work. The findings reveal that interpreters frequently face ethical dilemmas, particularly in contexts where their voices and decisions can significantly impact the outcomes for vulnerable populations. The study argues for a greater recognition of the invisible labor of interpreters and the need for ethical guidelines that support their well-being and professional integrity. This research contributes to a broader understanding of the role of interpreters in shaping communication and power relations in globalized settings."}
