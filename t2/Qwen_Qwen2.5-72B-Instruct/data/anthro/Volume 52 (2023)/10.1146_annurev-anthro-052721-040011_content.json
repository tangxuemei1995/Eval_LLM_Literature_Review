{"Abstract": "This paper explores the interdisciplinary field of Critical University Studies, focusing on its role in challenging and transforming the structures and ideologies of higher education. By integrating perspectives from decolonization, abolition, and Black studies, the paper examines how these frameworks can be applied to address systemic issues such as racial injustice, academic elitism, and the corporatization of universities. Through a critical analysis of current educational practices and policies, the study highlights the importance of fostering inclusive and equitable learning environments. The research also emphasizes the need for a radical reimagining of the university's purpose and function, advocating for a more democratic and socially just approach to higher education. This work contributes to ongoing conversations about the future of academia and the potential for transformative change within the institution."}
