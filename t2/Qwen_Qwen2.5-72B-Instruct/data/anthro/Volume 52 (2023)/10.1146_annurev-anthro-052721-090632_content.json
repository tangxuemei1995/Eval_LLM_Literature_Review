{"Abstract": "This study explores the concept of biological normalcy, integrating perspectives from human biology, cultural norms, and statistical analysis. By examining the variability in physiological and genetic traits across diverse populations, we challenge the notion of a universal biological norm. Our findings highlight the significant role of cultural and environmental factors in shaping normative views of human biology. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and original data analysis, we demonstrate that what is considered 'normal' often reflects cultural biases rather than objective biological standards. This research underscores the importance of recognizing biological variation and the need for more inclusive definitions of normalcy in medical and social contexts."}
