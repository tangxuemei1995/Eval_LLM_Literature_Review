{"Abstract": "This paper critically examines the role of military interventions, magic bullet approaches, and deterministic models in global public health, highlighting their limitations and the need for a more nuanced, context-sensitive approach. Drawing on anthropological perspectives and historical analyses, the study reveals how these interventions often perpetuate colonial legacies and overlook the complex social, economic, and cultural determinants of health. Through case studies from various regions, the paper illustrates how top-down, technocratic solutions can undermine local health systems and community resilience. It argues for a shift towards more participatory and equitable models of global health care, emphasizing the importance of local knowledge, community engagement, and sustainable development. The findings suggest that effective global health interventions require a deeper understanding of the historical and social contexts in which they are implemented."}
