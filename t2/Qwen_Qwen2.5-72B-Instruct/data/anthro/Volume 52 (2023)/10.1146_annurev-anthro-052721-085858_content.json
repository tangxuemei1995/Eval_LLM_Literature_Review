{"Abstract": "This review examines the physiological and metabolic adaptations of human bodies in extreme environments, including high altitudes, arctic conditions, and deserts. The study highlights the role of thermoregulation and metabolic adjustments in enabling survival and performance in these challenging settings. Additionally, it explores the impact of climate change on the prevalence and nature of extreme environments, and how structural inequalities affect access to adaptive resources and technologies. The findings underscore the need for interdisciplinary approaches to enhance human resilience and mitigate the adverse effects of environmental extremes."}
