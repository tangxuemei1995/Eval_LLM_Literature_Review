{"Abstract": "Aging is a complex process influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Recent advances in epigenetics have shed light on how environmental exposures can modify gene expression without altering the DNA sequence, thereby affecting the pace of human aging. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the interplay between environmental factors, such as diet, stress, and pollution, and epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA. The epigenetic clock, a biomarker of biological age, has emerged as a powerful tool to quantify the impact of these environmental influences on aging. Studies have shown that adverse environmental conditions can accelerate the epigenetic clock, leading to an increased risk of age-related diseases. Conversely, interventions that promote healthy lifestyles and reduce environmental stressors may decelerate the epigenetic clock and extend healthspan. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate the effects of environmental factors on aging and improve public health outcomes."}
