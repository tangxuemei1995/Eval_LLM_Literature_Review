{"Abstract": "This paper explores the controversy surrounding the Pirahã language, an indigenous language of the Amazon, and its implications for theories of linguistic universality and the nature of the human language faculty. The debate centers on claims that Pirahã lacks recursion, a feature considered by many linguists to be a universal component of human language. By examining the linguistic structure of Pirahã and comparing it with other languages, this study challenges the notion of a monolithic universal grammar and highlights the importance of linguistic diversity in understanding the cognitive capacities of humans. The findings suggest that while certain linguistic features may be less common, they do not necessarily indicate a lack of cognitive complexity. This research contributes to a broader dialogue on the relationship between language, culture, and cognition, emphasizing the need for a more nuanced approach to linguistic universals."}
