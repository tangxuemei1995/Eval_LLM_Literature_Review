{"Abstract": "This study examines the intricate dynamics between social movements, states, corporations, and tech companies in the context of mediated visibility. By analyzing the role of visual media, we explore how these entities negotiate power and influence public perception. The research highlights the strategies employed by social movements to leverage visual media for mobilization and awareness, while also addressing the challenges posed by state and corporate control over information dissemination. Through a multidisciplinary approach, the study provides insights into the evolving landscape of digital activism and the implications for social change."}
