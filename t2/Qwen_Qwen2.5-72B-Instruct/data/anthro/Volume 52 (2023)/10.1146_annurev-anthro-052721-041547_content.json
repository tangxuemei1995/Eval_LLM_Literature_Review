{"Abstract": "This paper explores the intricate relationship between algorithms and their ecological context, emphasizing the role of infrastructure and social imaginaries in shaping algorithmic systems. By examining the interface between human users and smart technology, we uncover how algorithms not only process data but also mediate social and environmental interactions. The study highlights the need for a holistic approach to understanding algorithmic ecosystems, where technical, social, and environmental factors are interwoven, and proposes a framework for an ecology of algorithms that can guide future research and design practices."}
