{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between religious conversion and political engagement, examining how the act of changing one's religious affiliation can lead to significant political transformations. Drawing on a diverse range of case studies from various cultural and geographical contexts, the research highlights the ways in which religious conversion not only alters individual identities but also reshapes community dynamics and political landscapes. The analysis reveals that religious conversion can serve as a catalyst for political activism, often leading to the formation of new social movements and the reconfiguration of existing political alliances. By focusing on the lived experiences of converts and their interactions with both religious and secular institutions, this study underscores the complex interplay between religious difference and political difference. The findings suggest that religious conversion can be a powerful force for political change, challenging existing power structures and promoting social justice."}
