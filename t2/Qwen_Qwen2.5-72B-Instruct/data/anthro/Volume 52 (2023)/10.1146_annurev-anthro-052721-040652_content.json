{"Abstract": "This paper explores the ongoing process of decolonizing museums, emphasizing the need for a paradigm shift in museum practices to better reflect and honor Indigenous perspectives and knowledge systems. Drawing on Native American scholarship, the study highlights the importance of indigenization, which involves not only the repatriation of cultural artifacts but also the reimagining of curatorial practices to include Indigenous voices and methodologies. Through a review of recent initiatives and case studies, the paper demonstrates how museums are beginning to transform their roles from custodians of colonial legacies to partners in the preservation and celebration of Indigenous cultures. The research underscores the critical role of collaboration between museums and Indigenous communities, advocating for a more equitable and inclusive approach to cultural representation and heritage management."}
