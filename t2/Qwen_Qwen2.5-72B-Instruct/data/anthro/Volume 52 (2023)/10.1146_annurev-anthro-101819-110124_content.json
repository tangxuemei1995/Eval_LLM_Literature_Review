{"Abstract": "This paper explores recent advancements in the archaeology of long-distance connections across the ancient Indian Ocean, focusing on the role of maritime networks in facilitating exchange between South Asia and its distant neighbors. Through the analysis of artifacts such as beads and ceramics, this study highlights the intricate web of trade and cultural interactions that spanned from the Arabian Peninsula to Southeast Asia. New excavations and the application of advanced analytical techniques have provided fresh insights into the chronology and scale of these exchanges, revealing the dynamic nature of ancient maritime trade routes. The findings underscore the importance of the Indian Ocean as a conduit for the spread of ideas, technologies, and goods, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the interconnectedness of ancient civilizations."}
