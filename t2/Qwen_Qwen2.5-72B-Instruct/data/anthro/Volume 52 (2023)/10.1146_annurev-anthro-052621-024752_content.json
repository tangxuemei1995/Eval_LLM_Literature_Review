{"Abstract": "This paper reevaluates the historical and scientific perceptions of Neandertals, challenging the long-standing narrative that has often been influenced by racial and cultural biases. By examining the archaeological evidence of symbolic behavior, such as the use of pigments, burial practices, and the creation of personal ornaments, we argue that Neandertals possessed a cognitive complexity previously underappreciated. The concept of the 'uncanny valley' is applied to explore why Neandertals have been historically depicted as both familiar and unsettling to modern humans, influencing scientific and public perceptions. This interdisciplinary approach integrates insights from the history of science, anthropology, and cognitive science to provide a more nuanced understanding of Neandertal cognition and culture, and to address the ethical implications of how we interpret and represent our evolutionary relatives."}
