{"Abstract": "This paper explores the intricate dynamics of security regimes within the context of transnational and imperial entanglements, emphasizing the intersections of race, gender, and power. Drawing on political anthropology and transnational feminism, the study examines how historical and contemporary imperial practices shape security policies and their impacts on marginalized communities. Through a critical analysis of case studies from various regions, the research highlights the ways in which security regimes perpetuate racial and gendered hierarchies, often under the guise of protection and stability. The findings suggest that a deeper understanding of these entanglements is crucial for developing more equitable and inclusive security frameworks that address the root causes of insecurity and promote social justice."}
