{"Abstract": "This review explores the intricate relationships between gut microbiota and human ecology and evolution, emphasizing the role of host-microbial interactions in shaping phenotypic variation. By examining studies on nonhuman primates, we highlight how dietary shifts, environmental factors, and social behaviors influence the composition and function of the gut microbiome. These microbial communities not only affect host metabolism and immune function but also contribute to the adaptive potential of host populations. Comparative analyses reveal that the gut microbiome has co-evolved with its hosts, playing a crucial role in the evolution of human dietary flexibility and disease resistance. Understanding these complex interactions is essential for elucidating the mechanisms underlying human health and disease, and for developing novel therapeutic strategies that leverage the microbiome."}
