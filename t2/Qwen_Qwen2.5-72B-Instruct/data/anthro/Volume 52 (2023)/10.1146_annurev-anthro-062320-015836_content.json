{"Abstract": "This paper reflects on a lifetime of academic engagement with Neolithic archaeology, emphasizing the dynamic and evolving nature of archaeological practice. Through a personal lens, the author explores the influence of feminist methodologies, digital archaeology, and middle-range theory on the interpretation of European prehistory. The narrative weaves together autobiographical elements with a critical examination of how shifting standpoints have shaped the construction of the past. The paper highlights the importance of acknowledging the inspirations and intellectual currents that have guided archaeological research, underscoring the need for a more reflexive and inclusive approach to the history of archaeology. By integrating these perspectives, the author advocates for a more nuanced understanding of Neolithic societies and the processes through which archaeological knowledge is produced and disseminated."}
