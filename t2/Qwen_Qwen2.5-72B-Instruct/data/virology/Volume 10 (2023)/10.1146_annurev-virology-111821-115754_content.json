{"Abstract": "The intricate relationship between the host microbiota and viral infections is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in disease outcomes. This review synthesizes recent findings on how the gut microbiota and its metabolites modulate the host's antiviral immune responses, particularly through interferon signaling pathways. Studies have shown that specific microbial taxa and their metabolites can enhance or suppress interferon production, influencing the susceptibility to and severity of viral infections. Additionally, the virome, the collection of viruses within the microbiome, plays a role in shaping the microbial community and its interactions with the host. Understanding these complex interactions could lead to novel therapeutic strategies that leverage the microbiota to prevent or treat viral infections."}
