{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate cross-kingdom interactions between plant and fungal viruses, focusing on mechanisms of virus transmission and extracellular transfer. We investigate how these viruses can infect hosts across different kingdoms, highlighting the role of virus-virus interactions in facilitating or inhibiting cross-kingdom infections. Through a combination of molecular biology, virology, and ecological studies, we provide evidence of the potential for plant viruses to infect fungi and vice versa, suggesting a broader host range than previously recognized. The implications of these findings for biocontrol strategies and the management of viral diseases in agricultural systems are discussed, emphasizing the need for a more integrated approach to understanding and managing viral infections across different biological kingdoms."}
