{"Abstract": "Herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus (HSV) and pseudorabies virus (PRV), are characterized by their ability to replicate within the host cell nucleus and subsequently exit this compartment. The nuclear egress complex (NEC), composed of viral proteins, plays a crucial role in this process by facilitating the budding of primary enveloped virions (PEVs) at the inner nuclear membrane. Despite significant advances, the precise mechanisms governing NEC assembly, the regulation of nuclear membrane fusion, and the subsequent release of PEVs remain areas of active investigation. This review summarizes the current understanding of herpesvirus nuclear egress, highlighting recent findings and identifying key gaps in our knowledge. Understanding these processes is essential for developing novel antiviral strategies that target the early stages of the viral life cycle."}
