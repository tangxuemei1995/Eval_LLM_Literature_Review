{"Abstract": "Microviridae, a family of single-stranded DNA phages, have been primarily studied through the well-characterized phiX174 bacteriophage. However, recent advancements in metagenomics and virome analysis have unveiled a diverse and complex world of microviruses beyond phiX174. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the taxonomy, evolution, and ecological roles of Microviridae, highlighting the discovery of novel microvirus lineages in various environments. Metagenomic studies have revealed a broader distribution and higher abundance of microviruses, suggesting their significant impact on microbial communities and ecosystems. The evolutionary dynamics of Microviridae, including mechanisms of genetic exchange and adaptation, are also discussed, emphasizing the need for further research to understand their role in shaping the virome and microbial interactions."}
