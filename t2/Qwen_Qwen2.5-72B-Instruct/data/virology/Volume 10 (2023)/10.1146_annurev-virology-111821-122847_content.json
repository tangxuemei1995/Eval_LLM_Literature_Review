{"Abstract": "Tobamoviruses, including Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV), pose significant threats to global agriculture by evading and manipulating plant immune responses. This review explores the intricate interplay between tobamoviruses and plant defense mechanisms, focusing on pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), resistance (R) genes, RNA silencing, and salicylic acid (SA) signaling. PTI acts as the first line of defense, recognizing conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns. However, tobamoviruses can suppress PTI, necessitating the activation of R genes for effective resistance. RNA silencing, a potent antiviral mechanism, is also targeted by tobamoviruses, which encode suppressors to counteract this defense. SA signaling plays a crucial role in systemic acquired resistance, enhancing plant defenses against viral infections. Understanding these interactions is essential for developing robust strategies to protect crops from tobamovirus infections."}
