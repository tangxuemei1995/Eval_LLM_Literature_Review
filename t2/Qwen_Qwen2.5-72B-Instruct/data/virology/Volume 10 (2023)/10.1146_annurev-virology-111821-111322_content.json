{"Abstract": "This study elucidates the intricate mechanisms by which mammalian cells process bacteriophages, focusing on the roles of endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, and the host's immune response. Bacteriophages, as components of the virome, can influence mammalian cell function and homeostasis. We demonstrate that upon exposure, mammalian cells internalize bacteriophages through endocytic pathways, which are then trafficked through the endosomal system. This process triggers specific signaling cascades that modulate intracellular immunity and inflammation. Our findings reveal that the presence of bacteriophages can activate pattern recognition receptors, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the enhancement of antiviral defenses. These results provide new insights into the dynamic interplay between mammalian cells and the virome, highlighting the potential implications for host health and disease."}
