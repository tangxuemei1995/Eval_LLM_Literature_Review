{"Abstract": "The intricate relationship between the gut microbiome, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids, and the regulation of immune homeostasis, inflammation, and HIV persistence is a burgeoning area of research. The gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in shaping the immune system, and dysbiosis can lead to chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction, which are hallmarks of HIV infection. SCFAs, primarily produced through the fermentation of dietary fibers by gut bacteria, have been shown to modulate immune responses and reduce inflammation. They can also influence the expression of genes involved in viral latency, potentially affecting HIV persistence. Bile acids, on the other hand, are known to interact with specific receptors that regulate immune cell function and metabolism, further impacting the inflammatory milieu and viral reservoirs. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of targeting the gut microbiome and its metabolites as a therapeutic strategy to mitigate immune dysfunction and reduce HIV persistence. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the mechanisms by which the microbiome, SCFAs, and bile acids influence immune homeostasis, inflammation, and HIV persistence, and discusses the implications for developing novel therapeutic interventions."}
