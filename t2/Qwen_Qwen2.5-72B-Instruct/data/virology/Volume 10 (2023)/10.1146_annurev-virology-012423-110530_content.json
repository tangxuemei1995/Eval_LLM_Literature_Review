{"Abstract": "The rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria poses a significant threat to global health, necessitating the development of alternative therapeutic strategies. Phage therapy, utilizing bacteriophages to target and lyse specific bacterial pathogens, has gained renewed interest. However, the evolution of phage-resistant bacteria remains a critical challenge. This study explores the use of phage cocktails and the exploitation of evolutionary trade-offs to enhance the efficacy and durability of phage therapy. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we demonstrate that phage cocktails can effectively reduce the likelihood of resistance emergence. Additionally, we identify specific genetic mutations associated with phage resistance that confer fitness costs, such as reduced growth rates and increased susceptibility to other phages. These findings suggest that by carefully selecting phage combinations and leveraging evolutionary trade-offs, it is possible to develop robust phage therapies that can overcome the evolution of bacterial resistance."}
