{"Abstract": "Viral membrane fusion, a critical step in the infection process, involves intricate interactions between viral fusion proteins and host cell membranes. This review elucidates the mechanisms of class I, II, and III viral fusion proteins, highlighting their distinct conformational changes and the formation of trimers-of-hairpins. The energetics of fusion, driven by the insertion of fusion peptides and loops into the target membrane, are discussed in the context of lipid dynamics and the role of fusion restriction factors. Recent studies reveal the importance of conformational intermediates and the dynamic nature of lipid rearrangements, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets to inhibit viral entry."}
