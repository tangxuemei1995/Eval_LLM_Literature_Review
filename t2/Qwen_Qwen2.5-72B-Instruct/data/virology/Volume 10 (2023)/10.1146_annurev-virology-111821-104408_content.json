{"Abstract": "The 1918 influenza pandemic, one of the most devastating infectious disease events in recorded history, has been the subject of extensive research through the use of reverse genetics to resurrect the virus. This approach has provided critical insights into the molecular basis of its exceptional virulence and transmission capabilities. Studies have revealed that the 1918 virus possessed unique genetic elements that enhanced its ability to replicate in human cells and transmit efficiently between hosts. These findings have not only deepened our understanding of the 1918 pandemic but also informed contemporary efforts to prepare for and mitigate the impact of future influenza pandemics. The research underscores the importance of continued surveillance and the development of broadly protective vaccines and antiviral therapies."}
