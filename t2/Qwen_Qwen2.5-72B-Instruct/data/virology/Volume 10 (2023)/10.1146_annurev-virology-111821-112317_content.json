{"Abstract": "Enteric viruses, including norovirus, play a significant role in shaping the immune response within the intestine. These viruses can modulate both innate and adaptive immune pathways, influencing the balance between tolerance and inflammation. Recent studies have highlighted the mechanisms by which enteric viruses interact with the intestinal mucosa, altering the expression of cytokines and chemokines, and affecting the function of immune cells such as dendritic cells and T lymphocytes. This immunomodulation can lead to both protective and pathological outcomes, depending on the viral strain and host factors. Understanding these complex interactions is crucial for developing strategies to prevent and treat enteric viral infections and associated diseases. The dynamic interplay between the virome and the host immune system underscores the importance of a holistic approach to studying intestinal health and disease."}
