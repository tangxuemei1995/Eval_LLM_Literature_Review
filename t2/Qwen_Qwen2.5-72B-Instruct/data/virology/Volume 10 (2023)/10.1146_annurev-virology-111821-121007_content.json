{"Abstract": "O-linked glycans play a crucial role in the structure and function of viral envelope proteins, particularly in regions such as the mucin-like domain. These glycans, including heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, are involved in various stages of the viral life cycle, from initial attachment to the host cell to the final egress of the virion. The dense glycosylation in the mucin-like domain can act as a shield, protecting the virus from host immune responses and facilitating viral entry. Additionally, these glycans can interact with cellular receptors, enhancing the virus's ability to attach and infect host cells. Understanding the specific roles of O-linked glycans in viral envelope proteins is essential for the development of effective vaccines and antiviral strategies. This review summarizes current knowledge on the structure and functional significance of O-linked glycans in viral envelope proteins, highlighting their importance in viral pathogenesis and potential as therapeutic targets."}
