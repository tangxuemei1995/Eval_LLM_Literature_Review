{"Abstract": "Viral evolution is intricately linked to the host's proteostasis networks, which regulate protein folding, stability, and degradation. This study explores how viral adaptation is influenced by the host's stress response and chaperone systems, which can both facilitate and constrain viral replication. Using a combination of virology, biophysics, and systems biology approaches, we demonstrate that viruses exploit host chaperones to enhance their protein folding efficiency, thereby accelerating their adaptation to antiviral drugs and immune pressures. However, this reliance on host proteostasis also creates vulnerabilities that can be targeted therapeutically. Our findings highlight the dynamic interplay between viral evolution and host protein quality control mechanisms, offering new insights into the development of strategies to combat viral drug and immune system resistance."}
