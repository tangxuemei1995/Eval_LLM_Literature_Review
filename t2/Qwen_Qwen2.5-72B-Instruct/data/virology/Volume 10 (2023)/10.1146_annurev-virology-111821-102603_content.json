{"Abstract": "Nonsegmented negative-strand (NNS) RNA viruses, including members of the order Mononegavirales such as paramyxoviruses, filoviruses, pneumoviruses, and rhabdoviruses, are characterized by their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) that is essential for viral replication and transcription. This review summarizes recent advances in understanding the structural and functional mechanisms of RdRPs from these viruses. High-resolution crystal structures and cryo-EM reconstructions have provided insights into the catalytic and regulatory domains of RdRPs, revealing conserved motifs and unique features that contribute to their specificity and efficiency. The interactions between RdRP and viral nucleoproteins, as well as host factors, are crucial for the regulation of viral gene expression and replication. Additionally, the role of RdRP in error-prone replication and the implications for viral evolution and pathogenesis are discussed. These findings enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying NNS RNA virus replication and offer potential targets for antiviral drug development."}
