{"Abstract": "This review explores the intersection of viral biology and biomolecular condensates, focusing on how viruses, particularly those with segmented RNA genomes like rotaviruses, exploit phase transitions to form viral factories or viroplasms. These dynamic, membrane-less compartments facilitate efficient viral replication and assembly by concentrating viral components and sequestering host factors. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and function of these condensates, revealing parallels with cellular biomolecular condensates. Understanding these processes not only enhances our knowledge of viral infection strategies but also provides insights into the broader principles of biomolecular organization and phase behavior in cells."}
