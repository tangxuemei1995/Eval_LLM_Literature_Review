{"Abstract": "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a critical mechanism employed by many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and HIV, to regulate the expression of essential proteins. This process involves the ribosome slipping by one or more nucleotides during translation, thereby altering the reading frame and producing distinct proteins from a single mRNA. The structural elements that mediate PRF, such as pseudoknots and slippery sequences, are highly conserved and play a pivotal role in viral replication and pathogenesis. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy and biochemical assays have provided detailed insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying PRF, revealing the dynamic interactions between the ribosome, mRNA, and viral factors. This review summarizes the current understanding of PRF, highlighting the structural and functional features of viral pseudoknots and their impact on translation efficiency. Additionally, the implications of PRF for antiviral drug development and therapeutic strategies are discussed, emphasizing the potential of targeting these unique translational control elements to combat viral infections."}
