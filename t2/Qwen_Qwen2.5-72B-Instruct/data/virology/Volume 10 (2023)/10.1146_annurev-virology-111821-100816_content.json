{"Abstract": "The viral protein U (Vpu) is a multifunctional accessory protein encoded by HIV-1, playing a crucial role in the viral life cycle and immune evasion. Despite its small size, Vpu exerts significant effects on host cell processes, including the downregulation of CD4, a key receptor for HIV entry, thereby preventing superinfection and enhancing viral release. Vpu also antagonizes tetherin, an antiviral protein that restricts the release of nascent virions from infected cells. Recent studies have revealed that Vpu can modulate the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, influencing the inflammatory response and potentially contributing to the establishment of chronic infection. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that Vpu may interact with components of the DNA damage repair machinery, further highlighting its versatility in manipulating host cell functions. These findings underscore the importance of Vpu in HIV pathogenesis and provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for intervention."}
