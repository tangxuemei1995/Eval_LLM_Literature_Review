{"Abstract": "The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway represents a critical component of the innate immune system, responsible for detecting cytosolic DNA and initiating antiviral defense mechanisms. Recent discoveries have expanded this paradigm to include the cyclic dinucleotide-based signaling systems (CBASS), which utilize nucleotide second messengers to mediate immune responses. This review explores the origins and mechanisms of these signaling pathways, highlighting the role of cGAS and STING in recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). We also discuss the cGAS-like receptors (cGLRs) and their involvement in generating cyclic dinucleotides that activate STING, leading to the production of type I interferons and other inflammatory cytokines. Understanding the intricate interplay between these components is essential for developing novel therapeutic strategies to modulate innate immune responses in infectious diseases and cancer."}
