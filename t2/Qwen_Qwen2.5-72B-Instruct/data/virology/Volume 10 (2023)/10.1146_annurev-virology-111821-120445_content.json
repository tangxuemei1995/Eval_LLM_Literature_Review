{"Abstract": "Segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses, including influenza viruses, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), pose significant threats to human health. These viruses have been extensively studied using genetic systems that facilitate the manipulation of their genomes. Recent advancements have led to the development of reporter strains, such as fluorescent and bioluminescent variants, which enable real-time monitoring of viral replication and spread in cell cultures and animal models. These tools have enhanced our understanding of viral pathogenesis, host-virus interactions, and the evaluation of antiviral compounds. This review summarizes the genetic systems used to generate these reporter strains and highlights their experimental applications in virology research, emphasizing their utility in elucidating viral life cycles and developing novel therapeutic strategies."}
