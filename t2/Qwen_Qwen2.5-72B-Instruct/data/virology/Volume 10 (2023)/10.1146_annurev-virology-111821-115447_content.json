{"Abstract": "Influenza viruses pose a significant public health challenge due to their rapid transmission through airborne and respiratory routes. This review examines the effectiveness of various barriers and interventions in blocking the spread of influenza viruses. Key strategies include the use of vaccines and antivirals, which not only reduce viral load but also limit transmission. Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as the use of masks, improved ventilation, and UV light disinfection are also crucial. Masks effectively filter respiratory droplets, while enhanced ventilation dilutes viral particles in the air. UV light can inactivate viruses on surfaces and in the air. Additionally, the role of mucus in trapping and clearing viruses is discussed, highlighting its importance in natural defense mechanisms. Understanding the persistence of the virus in different environments is essential for developing comprehensive strategies to control influenza transmission."}
