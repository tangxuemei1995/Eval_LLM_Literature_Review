{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between the body and brain, particularly focusing on the hippocampus and its role in memory through the lens of sharp-wave ripples (SWRs). By integrating concepts of homeostasis and allostasis, we examine how the hippocampus not only supports memory consolidation but also contributes to the regulation of bodily functions such as glucose metabolism. Our findings suggest that SWRs facilitate the exaptation of memory processes, enabling the brain to optimize body control and maintain physiological balance. This body-brain partnership highlights the adaptive significance of memory in supporting complex cognitive functions and physiological homeostasis, offering new insights into the mechanisms underlying cognitive and metabolic health."}
