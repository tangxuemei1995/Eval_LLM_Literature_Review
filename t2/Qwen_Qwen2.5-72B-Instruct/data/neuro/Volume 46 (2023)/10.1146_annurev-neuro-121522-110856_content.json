{"Abstract": "This study explores the neural mechanisms underlying sexually dimorphic social behaviors, focusing on the role of GABA neurons and the social behavior network (SBN) from development to adulthood. Using a combination of genetic, pharmacological, and behavioral approaches, we investigated how epigenetic modifications and aromatase activity influence the development and function of the SBN. Our findings reveal that GABAergic signaling in specific brain regions is crucial for the regulation of aggression and social play, with distinct patterns observed between males and females. Epigenetic modifications, particularly those affecting aromatase expression, were found to modulate these behaviors by altering neural circuitry during critical developmental periods. These results provide new insights into the neural and molecular mechanisms that govern sexually dimorphic social behaviors, highlighting the importance of considering both genetic and environmental factors in understanding social behavior."}
