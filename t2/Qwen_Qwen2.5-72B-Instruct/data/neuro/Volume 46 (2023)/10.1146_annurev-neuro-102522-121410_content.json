{"Abstract": "This review synthesizes recent findings on the specialized neural networks that underpin social cognition in the primate brain. Key regions, including the superior temporal sulcus, fusiform face area, and prefrontal cortex, are intricately involved in processing social information, such as facial expressions and gaze direction. These areas form a distributed network that supports the recognition and interpretation of social cues, essential for effective social interaction. Advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging, have elucidated the functional connectivity and structural organization of these networks, revealing how they integrate sensory input with social knowledge. The review also highlights the role of these networks in disorders of social cognition, such as autism spectrum disorder, where disruptions in social brain function are evident. Understanding the neural mechanisms of social cognition is crucial for developing targeted interventions and therapies for social cognitive deficits."}
