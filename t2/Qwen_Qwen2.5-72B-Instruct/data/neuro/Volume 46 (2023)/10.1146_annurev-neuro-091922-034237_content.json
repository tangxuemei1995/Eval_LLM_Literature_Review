{"Abstract": "Cholesterol metabolism plays a critical role in the aging brain and the development of age-related neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies have highlighted the importance of cholesterol homeostasis in neurons and microglia, with dysregulation contributing to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. This review summarizes current understanding of cholesterol metabolism in the context of aging, focusing on the interplay between neurons and microglia. We discuss how age-related changes in cholesterol synthesis, transport, and efflux can lead to the accumulation of cholesterol in neuronal membranes, impairing synaptic function and increasing vulnerability to neurotoxic insults. Additionally, we explore the role of microglial cholesterol metabolism in modulating inflammatory responses and the clearance of amyloid-beta, a key pathological feature of AD. Understanding these mechanisms may provide new therapeutic targets for preventing or treating age-related neurological disorders."}
