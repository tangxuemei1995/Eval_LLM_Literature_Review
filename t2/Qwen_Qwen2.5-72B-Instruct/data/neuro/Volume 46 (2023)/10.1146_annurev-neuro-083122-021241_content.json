{"Abstract": "The modular architecture of the mouse visual cortex integrates feedforward and feedback information streams through patchy connections, particularly in layer 1. These connections, enriched with M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, facilitate the dynamic interaction between processing streams, enhancing the hierarchical processing of visual information. This integration is crucial for the refinement of visual perception and the coordination of complex visual tasks. The study reveals how the interplay between these streams contributes to the functional organization of the visual cortex, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying visual processing and perception."}
