{"Abstract": "Astrocyte endfeet, the specialized processes that ensheath cerebral blood vessels, play a critical role in regulating the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and cerebral blood flow (CBF). These structures are integral to neurovascular coupling, the process by which neural activity is translated into changes in vascular tone and blood flow. Despite their importance, several open questions remain regarding the molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern the function of astrocyte endfeet. This review highlights recent advances in understanding how astrocyte endfeet interact with the vasculature to modulate BBB integrity and CBF, and discusses the implications of these interactions in neurological disorders. Emerging evidence suggests that dysregulation of astrocyte endfeet may contribute to the pathogenesis of conditions such as stroke, Alzheimerâ€™s disease, and epilepsy, underscoring the need for further research to elucidate the complex interplay between astrocytes and the vasculature."}
