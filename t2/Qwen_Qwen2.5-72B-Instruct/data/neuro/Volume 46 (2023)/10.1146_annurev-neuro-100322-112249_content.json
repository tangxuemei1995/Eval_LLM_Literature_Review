{"Abstract": "Circadian rhythms, regulated by the internal circadian clock, play a crucial role in maintaining physiological homeostasis, including sleep-wake cycles and metabolic processes. Astrocytes, once considered mere support cells, are now recognized as active participants in these rhythms through calcium signaling and the release of gliotransmitters. This review explores the dual role of astrocytes in circadian regulation, highlighting their beneficial effects on sleep quality and cognitive function, as well as their potential involvement in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Recent studies have shown that disrupted circadian rhythms in astrocytes can lead to impaired calcium homeostasis, contributing to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, the role of astrocytes in glioma, a type of brain cancer, is discussed, emphasizing the complex interplay between circadian dysregulation and tumor progression. Understanding these mechanisms may provide new therapeutic targets for treating circadian-related disorders and neurodegenerative diseases."}
