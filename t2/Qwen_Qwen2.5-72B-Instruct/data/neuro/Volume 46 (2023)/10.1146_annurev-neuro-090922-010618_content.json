{"Abstract": "The formation of a cognitive map, a neural representation of the spatial environment, is a fundamental aspect of navigation and memory. This process involves the coordinated development of circuits in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex and place cells in the hippocampus are key components, forming a spatially organized network that supports spatial navigation and memory. Recent studies have elucidated the developmental mechanisms underlying the maturation of these circuits, including the role of experience-dependent plasticity and intrinsic neural dynamics. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the developmental trajectory of these circuits, highlighting the interplay between genetic programs and environmental influences. Understanding these processes is crucial for advancing our knowledge of spatial cognition and may provide insights into disorders affecting spatial memory and navigation."}
