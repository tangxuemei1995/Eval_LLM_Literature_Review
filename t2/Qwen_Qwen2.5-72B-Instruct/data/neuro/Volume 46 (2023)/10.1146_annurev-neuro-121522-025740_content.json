{"Abstract": "The striatum, a key component of the basal ganglia, is intricately involved in the regulation of motor and cognitive functions. Within this structure, striosomes and matrisomes form distinct microcircuits that are crucial for the dynamic coupling of volition and action. Striosomes, which are enriched in dopamine receptors, are hypothesized to play a pivotal role in the reinforcement learning process, facilitating the association between actions and their outcomes. Conversely, matrisomes, characterized by their dense connectivity with the cortex and thalamus, are thought to integrate contextual information and guide goal-directed behavior. Recent studies have highlighted the interplay between these two scaffolds, suggesting that their coordinated activity is essential for adaptive behavior. Specifically, dopamine signaling within striosomes modulates the activity of matrisomes, thereby fine-tuning the selection and execution of motor actions. This dynamic coupling is particularly evident in tasks that require the integration of sensory input, decision-making, and motor output. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this interaction could provide valuable insights into the neural basis of learning and motor control, with potential implications for the treatment of disorders affecting the basal ganglia, such as Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease."}
