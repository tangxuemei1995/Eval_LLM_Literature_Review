{"Abstract": "This review explores the role of neural networks in navigation, focusing on the integration of memory, menotaxis, and path integration mechanisms. We examine how head direction cells and dopamine signaling contribute to the formation and maintenance of spatial representations. The paper discusses the computational principles underlying coordinate transformations that enable accurate navigation. By synthesizing findings from both experimental and theoretical studies, we highlight the intricate interplay between neural connections and computations that underpin navigational abilities in complex environments."}
