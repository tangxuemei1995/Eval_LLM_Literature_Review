{"Abstract": "The integration of vestibular and visual cues in the cerebral cortex is crucial for spatial navigation, visual processing, and perception. This study explores how these sensory modalities are combined to enhance the accuracy and reliability of self-motion perception and spatial orientation. Using a combination of neuroimaging techniques and behavioral experiments, we demonstrate that specific regions of the cerebral cortex, including the posterior parietal cortex and the medial temporal lobe, play a pivotal role in the multisensory integration of vestibular and visual information. Our findings reveal that the dynamic interplay between these sensory inputs not only supports the perception of self-motion but also contributes to the formation of stable spatial representations. These results provide new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the integration of vestibular and visual cues, highlighting the importance of multisensory processing in the context of spatial navigation and perception."}
