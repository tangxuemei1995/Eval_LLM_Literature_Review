{"Abstract": "Context-dependent learning, a critical aspect of adaptive behavior, involves the integration of environmental cues to guide learning and memory processes. This study explores the computational and neural mechanisms underlying context-dependent learning, emphasizing the roles of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and motor cortex. Using a combination of computational modeling and neuroimaging techniques, we demonstrate that Bayesian inference provides a robust framework for understanding how these brain regions dynamically interact to encode and retrieve context-specific information. Our findings reveal that the prefrontal cortex plays a pivotal role in modulating the hippocampal and thalamic circuits, facilitating the formation of context-dependent memories. Additionally, the motor cortex is shown to be crucial for the execution of context-appropriate behaviors. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the neural bases of continual learning and have implications for the development of more effective learning algorithms and therapeutic interventions for cognitive disorders."}
