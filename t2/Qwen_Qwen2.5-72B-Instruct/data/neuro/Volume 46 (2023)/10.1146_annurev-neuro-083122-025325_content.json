{"Abstract": "The spinal cord houses a complex network of interneurons that play a critical role in motor control, particularly in the coordination of locomotion. These interneurons, located in the ventral horn, exhibit remarkable diversity in their morphology, physiology, and connectivity, which underpins the precise control of movement. Recent studies have elucidated the intricate circuitry involving excitatory and inhibitory interneurons, highlighting their involvement in reflexes, pattern generation, and sensory feedback. Advances in genetic and optogenetic tools have enabled the manipulation and mapping of specific interneuron populations, revealing their distinct contributions to motor tasks. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the diversity and connectivity of spinal interneurons, emphasizing their functional roles in motor control and the implications for understanding and treating spinal cord injuries and neurological disorders."}
