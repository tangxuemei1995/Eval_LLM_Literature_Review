{"Abstract": "This review synthesizes recent advances in the field of circuit neuroscience, focusing on the neural circuits that underpin emotion states across species. By integrating findings from rodent, non-human primate, and human studies, we elucidate the core neural substrates and mechanisms that govern emotional valence. Key circuits, including those involving the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and insula, are examined in detail, highlighting their roles in processing positive and negative affect. Cross-species approaches reveal both conserved and divergent features, offering insights into the evolution of emotional processing. Advanced techniques such as optogenetics and in vivo imaging have provided unprecedented resolution, enabling a more nuanced understanding of how these circuits dynamically interact to shape emotional behavior. This comprehensive overview underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in advancing our knowledge of the neural basis of emotion."}
