{"Abstract": "Migraine, a debilitating neurological disorder, is intricately linked to the meninges, the protective layers surrounding the brain. This review explores the role of meningeal mechanisms, particularly the activation of meningeal afferents and the trigeminal nerve, in the pathophysiology of migraine. Neurogenic inflammation, triggered by the release of inflammatory mediators, contributes to the sensitization of these afferents, amplifying pain signals and leading to the characteristic throbbing headache. Cortical spreading depression, a wave of neuronal and glial depolarization, is also implicated in initiating and propagating migraine attacks. Understanding these mechanisms provides a foundation for developing targeted therapies to alleviate migraine symptoms and improve patient outcomes."}
