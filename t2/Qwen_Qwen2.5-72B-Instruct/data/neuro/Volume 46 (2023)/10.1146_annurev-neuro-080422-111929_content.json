{"Abstract": "The visual system of Drosophila melanogaster has been a model for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying motion detection. This study explores the computational principles that enable direction selectivity in the fly's visual system, focusing on the role of multiplicative disinhibition. Using a combination of electrophysiological recordings and computational modeling, we demonstrate that multiplicative disinhibition, where the inhibitory input to a neuron is modulated by the strength of the excitatory input, is crucial for the fly's ability to detect the direction of moving stimuli. Our findings suggest that this mechanism allows for efficient and robust motion detection, even under varying light conditions. This work provides new insights into the neural computations that underlie motion perception and highlights the importance of nonlinear interactions in sensory processing."}
