{"Abstract": "The therapeutic potential of PTBP1 inhibition has been explored in the context of glia-to-neuron conversion, particularly in the regeneration of dopaminergic neurons and retina ganglion cells. However, recent studies have shown that the inhibition of PTBP1 does not directly lead to the reprogramming of astrocytes or MÃ¼ller glia into neurons. Instead, the observed neurogenic effects may be attributed to alternative mechanisms, such as the modulation of glial support functions or the enhancement of endogenous neurogenic processes. This review synthesizes current evidence from in vitro and in vivo models, highlighting the complexities and limitations of PTBP1 inhibition as a strategy for neural repair. The findings suggest that while PTBP1 inhibition may have indirect benefits, it is not a straightforward solution for glia-to-neuron conversion and further research is needed to elucidate its precise role in neural regeneration."}
