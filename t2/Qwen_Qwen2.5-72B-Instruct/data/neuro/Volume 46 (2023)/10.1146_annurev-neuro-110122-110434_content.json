{"Abstract": "Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a promising therapeutic intervention for treatment-resistant Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and depression. This review synthesizes recent advancements in psychiatric neurosurgery, focusing on the neuromodulatory effects of DBS. Clinical trials and case studies indicate that DBS targeting the ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) and subgenual cingulate cortex (Brodmann area 25) can significantly reduce symptom severity in both conditions. Mechanistic insights suggest that DBS modulates dysfunctional neural circuits, restoring normal activity patterns and improving cognitive and affective processing. However, the optimal stimulation parameters and long-term efficacy remain areas of active investigation. This paper also discusses the challenges and ethical considerations associated with DBS, including patient selection criteria and the potential for side effects. Future research should aim to refine targeting strategies and personalize treatment protocols to maximize therapeutic outcomes."}
