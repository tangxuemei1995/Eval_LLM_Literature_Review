{"Abstract": "Large Old World fruit bats, particularly species of the genus Pteropus, are facing unprecedented threats that are pushing them to the brink of extinction. These keystone species, often referred to as flying foxes, play crucial roles in seed dispersal and pollination, which are vital for maintaining the ecological balance of tropical and subtropical forests. However, their populations are declining due to a combination of factors, including overhunting, habitat loss, and the impacts of climate change. Hunting for bushmeat and traditional medicine, along with deforestation and the destruction of roosting sites, have significantly reduced their numbers. Climate change exacerbates these issues by altering fruiting and flowering patterns, leading to food scarcity. The loss of these bats could have far-reaching consequences for island ecosystems, affecting biodiversity and human livelihoods. Conservation efforts, including legal protection, habitat restoration, and community engagement, are urgently needed to safeguard these vital species and the ecosystems they support."}
