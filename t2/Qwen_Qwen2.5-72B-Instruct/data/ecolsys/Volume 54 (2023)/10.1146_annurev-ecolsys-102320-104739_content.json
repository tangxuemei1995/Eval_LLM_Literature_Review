{"Abstract": "Seed dispersal is a critical ecological process that influences plant population dynamics, community structure, and ecosystem function. This study integrates the movement ecology paradigm and the generalized gravity framework to explore the causes and consequences of seed dispersal. We examine dispersal syndromes and the seedscape, highlighting how different dispersal processes affect seed dispersal effectiveness. By synthesizing data from various ecosystems, we identify key factors that drive seed dispersal, including abiotic conditions, animal vectors, and landscape features. Our findings reveal that seed dispersal effectiveness is not only influenced by the distance and direction of movement but also by the quality of the dispersal process and the suitability of the deposition site. This comprehensive approach enhances our understanding of the complex interactions within seed dispersal systems and their broader ecological implications."}
