{"Abstract": "Sky islands, isolated mountainous regions surrounded by dissimilar lowland environments, serve as natural laboratories for studying the ecological and evolutionary impacts of climate change. These unique ecosystems harbor relict populations and high levels of genetic variation, making them ideal for observing convergent evolution and adaptive responses. This study synthesizes global data from sky islands to predict how species will respond to changing climates. By analyzing genetic diversity, species distribution, and environmental variables, we identify key patterns of adaptation and vulnerability. Our findings suggest that sky islands can act as early warning systems for broader ecological shifts, providing critical insights into the mechanisms that drive biodiversity under climate stress. This research underscores the importance of conserving these unique habitats to maintain genetic reservoirs and promote resilience in the face of global environmental change."}
