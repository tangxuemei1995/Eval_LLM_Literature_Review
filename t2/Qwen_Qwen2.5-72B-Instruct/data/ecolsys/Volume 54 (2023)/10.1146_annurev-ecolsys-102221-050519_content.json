{"Abstract": "Amphibians exhibit a wide array of parental care behaviors, offering valuable insights into the evolution of these strategies. This review synthesizes current literature on amphibian parental care, focusing on the influence of fertilization mode, terrestriality, and parental sex roles. We find that external fertilization and terrestrial environments often correlate with more complex forms of care, such as egg protection, transport, and provisioning. Male and female amphibians exhibit distinct but complementary roles, with males often providing protection and females contributing to nutrition. These behaviors are crucial for offspring survival and can influence the evolutionary trajectory of species. Understanding these dynamics not only enhances our knowledge of amphibian biology but also provides broader implications for the study of parental care across taxa."}
