{"Abstract": "Density-dependent selection plays a crucial role in shaping the evolutionary dynamics of populations, particularly in the context of age structure and population regulation. This study explores how varying population densities influence selection pressures, leading to distinct norms of reaction and adaptive strategies. Through a combination of theoretical models and empirical data, we demonstrate that at low densities, populations exhibit r-selection, favoring traits that maximize reproductive rate and early reproduction. Conversely, at high densities, K-selection prevails, promoting traits that enhance competitive ability and survival in resource-limited environments. The age structure of the population further modulates these selection pressures, with younger age classes being more sensitive to density changes. Our findings highlight the importance of density-dependent selection in understanding the mechanisms of population regulation and the evolution of life history traits."}
