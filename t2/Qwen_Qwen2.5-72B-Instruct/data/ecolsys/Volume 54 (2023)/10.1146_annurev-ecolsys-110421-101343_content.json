{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of conservation paleobiology to understand the dynamics of terrestrial communities in the face of current environmental stressors. By analyzing fossil records, we can identify historical patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem resilience, providing valuable insights for modern conservation strategies. The research highlights the importance of paleoecological data in predicting species responses to anthropogenic changes, such as habitat loss and climate change. Our findings suggest that integrating historical ecological data can enhance our ability to manage and restore ecosystems effectively, offering a robust framework for conservation in the Anthropocene."}
