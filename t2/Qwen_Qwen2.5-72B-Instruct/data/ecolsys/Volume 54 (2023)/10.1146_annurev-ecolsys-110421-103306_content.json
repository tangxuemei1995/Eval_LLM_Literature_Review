{"Abstract": "The Anolis lizards of the Caribbean represent a classic model system for studying adaptive radiation and evolutionary processes. Recent research has provided new insights into the mechanisms driving the diversification of these lizards, including the roles of ecological opportunity, niche partitioning, and phenotypic plasticity. Studies have also highlighted the impact of human activities in the Anthropocene, such as habitat fragmentation and introduced species, on anole populations. This review synthesizes these findings, emphasizing the importance of integrating ecological and evolutionary perspectives to understand the ongoing dynamics of anole communities. The results not only advance our knowledge of anole biology but also offer broader implications for the conservation and management of biodiversity in rapidly changing environments."}
