{"Abstract": "Urban environments present unique challenges and opportunities for pollination ecology. This study investigates the dynamics of pollinator communities and their interactions within urban landscapes, focusing on the roles of mutualism, dispersal, and connectivity. By analyzing pollinator networks in various city settings, we explore how urbanization affects species diversity, abundance, and the structure of plant-pollinator interactions. Our findings highlight the importance of green spaces and urban planning in maintaining pollinator services, suggesting that strategic connectivity between urban green patches can enhance pollinator dispersal and support mutualistic relationships. The results underscore the need for integrated conservation strategies to promote biodiversity and ecological resilience in urban areas."}
