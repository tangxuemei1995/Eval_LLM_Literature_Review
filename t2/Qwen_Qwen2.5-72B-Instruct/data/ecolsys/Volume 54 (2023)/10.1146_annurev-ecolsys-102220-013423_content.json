{"Abstract": "This study explores the functional trait variation of invasive animal species along their invasion pathways, integrating insights from community ecology, physiology, and phenotypic plasticity. We analyzed a comprehensive dataset of invasive species, focusing on traits that confer competitive advantages, such as rapid reproduction, broad dietary flexibility, and high dispersal capability. Our findings reveal that invasive species exhibit significant phenotypic plasticity, allowing them to adapt to new environments and outcompete native species. We also identified key physiological traits, such as metabolic rate and stress tolerance, that are crucial for successful invasion. These traits are often more pronounced in invasive populations compared to their native counterparts, suggesting a selection for invasive phenotypes during the colonization process. Our results highlight the importance of considering functional traits in predicting and managing biological invasions, and provide a framework for understanding the mechanisms underlying the success of invasive species."}
