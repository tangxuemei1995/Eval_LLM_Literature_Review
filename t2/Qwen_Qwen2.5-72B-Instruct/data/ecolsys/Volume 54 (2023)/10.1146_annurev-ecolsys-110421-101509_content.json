{"Abstract": "The origin of life remains one of the most intriguing puzzles in science. This review explores how life's fundamental processes, such as CO2 fixation and the emergence of protocells, may have guided its own origins. We discuss the role of FeS clusters in early metabolism and the establishment of a proton-motive force, which likely provided the energy necessary for the first protocells. The transition from an RNA world to the genetic code is examined, highlighting the co-evolution of metabolic pathways and genetic information. This integrated perspective suggests that the earliest forms of life were not isolated chemical reactions but complex, self-organizing systems that harnessed environmental energy to sustain and evolve."}
