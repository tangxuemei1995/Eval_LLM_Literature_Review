{"Abstract": "This study explores the critical role of variability in marine climate change ecology, focusing on the impacts of heatwaves and mean temperature changes. We analyze how variability, including the frequency and intensity of heatwaves, influences the acclimation and survival of marine species. Depth refuge, a key factor in mitigating the effects of surface heatwaves, is examined as a potential strategy for species persistence. Legacy effects, the long-term impacts of past environmental conditions, are also considered to understand how historical variability shapes current ecological responses. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating variability into climate models and conservation strategies to better predict and manage the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems."}
