{"Abstract": "Background acoustics play a crucial role in terrestrial ecosystems, influencing the behavior and interactions of various species. This study explores the direct and indirect effects of ambient sounds on community ecology, focusing on how natural and anthropogenic noise impacts hearing and communication. By analyzing soundscapes across different habitats, we identify patterns in species distribution and behavior, revealing that masking effects can alter predator-prey dynamics and mating signals. Our findings highlight the importance of considering acoustic environments in conservation efforts and ecological research, suggesting that preserving natural soundscapes is essential for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem function."}
