{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has provided unprecedented insights into the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of emerging infectious diseases, particularly those of zoonotic origin. This study synthesizes current knowledge on the spillover mechanisms, evolution of virulence, and the role of social behavior in disease transmission. We analyze how anthropogenic factors, such as habitat destruction and wildlife trade, increase the likelihood of zoonotic spillover events. Additionally, we explore the rapid evolutionary changes in SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the importance of viral genetic diversity in shaping disease outcomes. The impact of social behavior, including human mobility and social interactions, on the spread of the virus is examined, emphasizing the need for adaptive disease control strategies. Our findings underscore the critical role of interdisciplinary approaches in understanding and mitigating the risks of future pandemics, integrating ecological, evolutionary, and social sciences to enhance global health security."}
