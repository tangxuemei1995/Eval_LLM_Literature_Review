{"Abstract": "Terrestrial phosphorus (P) cycling is a critical component of ecosystem function, influencing productivity and nutrient dynamics in forests, grasslands, and tundra. This study synthesizes recent experimental and modeling efforts to elucidate how climatic change, including warming and altered precipitation patterns, affects P availability and cycling in these ecosystems. Results from field experiments indicate that warming can enhance P mineralization in soils, particularly in P-limited systems, while increased precipitation can lead to greater P leaching, reducing its availability. Modeling studies support these findings, suggesting that the interactive effects of temperature and moisture will play a pivotal role in shaping future P dynamics. The implications of these changes are significant, as they can alter plant community composition and ecosystem productivity, with potential feedbacks to the global carbon cycle. This review highlights the need for integrated approaches that combine experimental data with predictive models to better understand and manage the impacts of climatic change on terrestrial P cycling."}
