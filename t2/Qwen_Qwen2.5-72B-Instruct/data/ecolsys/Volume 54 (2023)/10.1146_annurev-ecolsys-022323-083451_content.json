{"Abstract": "Pleiotropy, the phenomenon where a single gene influences multiple phenotypic traits, plays a crucial role in evolutionary biology. This study explores the patterns and evolutionary consequences of pleiotropy, focusing on its impact on adaptation and the cost of complexity. Through a comprehensive review of empirical and theoretical studies, we highlight how antagonistic pleiotropy, where a gene has beneficial effects on one trait but detrimental effects on another, can constrain evolutionary trajectories and contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation. We also examine the role of pleiotropy in the evolution of complex diseases, illustrating how mutations with pleiotropic effects can lead to trade-offs that influence disease susceptibility and fitness. Our findings underscore the importance of considering pleiotropic effects in understanding the genetic basis of adaptation and the evolution of complex traits."}
