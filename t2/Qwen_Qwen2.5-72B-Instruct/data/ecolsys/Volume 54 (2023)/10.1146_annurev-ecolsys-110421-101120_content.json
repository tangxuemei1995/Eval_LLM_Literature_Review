{"Abstract": "This study explores the impacts of novel disturbance regimes on ecological systems, focusing on the resilience, recovery, and succession processes. By analyzing response traits and identifying critical thresholds, we assess how ecosystems adapt to unprecedented disturbances such as extreme weather events and invasive species. Our findings highlight the importance of adaptive management strategies to enhance ecosystem resilience and facilitate recovery. Through a synthesis of empirical data and theoretical models, we demonstrate that the integration of response traits into management practices can improve the predictability of ecological responses and support the development of more effective conservation measures. This research underscores the need for a dynamic and flexible approach to ecosystem management in the face of global environmental change."}
