{"Abstract": "This study explores the ecophysiological mechanisms that have driven the evolution of diving, foraging, and fasting behaviors in cetaceans, with a particular focus on the role of body size and scaling. By integrating data from biomechanics, energetics, and predatorâ€“prey interactions, we elucidate how gigantism in whales has influenced their ability to exploit deep-water resources and endure prolonged periods without feeding. Our findings reveal that larger body size enhances diving capacity and foraging efficiency, but also imposes constraints on metabolic rates and energy storage. These trade-offs have shaped the foraging strategies of cetaceans, enabling them to thrive in diverse marine environments. The results provide insights into the evolutionary adaptations that have allowed whales to become the largest animals on Earth, while highlighting the ecological and physiological limits that govern their survival."}
