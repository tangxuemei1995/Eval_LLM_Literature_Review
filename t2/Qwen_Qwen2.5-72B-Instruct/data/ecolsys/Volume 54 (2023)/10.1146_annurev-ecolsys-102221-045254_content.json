{"Abstract": "This study explores the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of plant chemical defenses, focusing on the role of secondary metabolites in shaping plant-herbivore interactions and community assembly. By integrating molecular, physiological, and ecological approaches, we examine how the diversity and specificity of plant secondary metabolites influence herbivore feeding preferences and population dynamics. Our findings reveal that the evolution of chemical defenses is driven by a complex interplay between biotic and abiotic factors, leading to the diversification of defense strategies across plant communities. We also highlight the importance of these chemical defenses in mediating species coexistence and structuring plant communities. This research underscores the need for a multi-scale approach to understand the ecological and evolutionary significance of plant chemical defenses, from molecular mechanisms to community-level processes."}
