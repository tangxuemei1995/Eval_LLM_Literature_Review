{"Abstract": "South Florida, recognized as the worldâ€™s most invaded continental ecoregion, presents a unique case study for understanding the dynamics of non-native species introduction, spread, and ecological impact. This research synthesizes data from over 150 studies, examining the patterns of introduction and establishment of non-native species, including plants, animals, and insects. The findings highlight the role of human-mediated pathways, such as trade and transport, in facilitating the introduction of these species. The empty niche hypothesis is explored as a potential driver for the successful establishment and spread of non-native species in the region. Ecological impacts, including competition with native species, habitat alteration, and predation, are assessed, revealing significant disruptions to local ecosystems. The effectiveness of current biological control and eradication efforts is evaluated, with mixed results indicating the need for more integrated and adaptive management strategies. This study underscores the importance of proactive measures and continued research to mitigate the ecological and economic consequences of invasive species in South Florida."}
