{"Abstract": "This study investigates the response of deep soil organic carbon (SOC) to global change, including climate change, elevated CO2, and land use and land cover changes. Utilizing a meta-analysis of 120 studies, we found that deep SOC stocks are more resilient to climate change than surface SOC, but are significantly affected by land use changes, particularly deforestation and agricultural intensification. Elevated CO2 levels were shown to increase deep SOC sequestration by enhancing root biomass and microbial activity. However, the magnitude of this effect varies across different soil types and climatic regions. Our findings highlight the importance of deep SOC in the global carbon cycle and suggest that land management practices that promote deep root growth and soil conservation can enhance carbon sequestration and mitigate the impacts of global change."}
