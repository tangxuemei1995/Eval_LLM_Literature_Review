{"Abstract": "This paper explores the interplay between language change and poetic form through the lens of Pāṇini’s grammar, examining how historical shifts in language have influenced the evolution of poetic structures. It also delves into the autobiographical elements within these changes, offering a retrospective analysis and prospective insights into the future of linguistic and literary traditions."}
