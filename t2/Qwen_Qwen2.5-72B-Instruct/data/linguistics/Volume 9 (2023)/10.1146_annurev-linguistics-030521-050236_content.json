{"Abstract": "This study explores the dynamics of heritage languages, focusing on the processes of language acquisition, attrition, and reactivation among heritage speakers. Heritage languages, often acquired in early childhood but subsequently underused, exhibit unique characteristics that distinguish them from both native and second languages. The research examines the linguistic competencies of heritage speakers, comparing their performance with that of native speakers and second language learners. Key findings indicate that while heritage speakers may experience L1 attrition, particularly in formal grammatical structures, they retain robust lexical and pragmatic skills. The study also investigates the effectiveness of relearning strategies, demonstrating that targeted interventions can significantly enhance heritage speakers' linguistic proficiency. Implications for bilingualism and language education policies are discussed, highlighting the importance of supporting heritage language maintenance and reactivation to preserve linguistic diversity and cultural heritage."}
