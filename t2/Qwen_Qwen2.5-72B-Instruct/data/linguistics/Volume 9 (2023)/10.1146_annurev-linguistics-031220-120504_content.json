{"Abstract": "This paper reviews recent technological advancements that have significantly impacted the processes of resource creation and mobilization in language documentation. The integration of digital tools, such as automated transcription software, machine learning algorithms, and cloud-based storage solutions, has streamlined the collection, analysis, and dissemination of linguistic data. These technologies not only enhance the efficiency and accuracy of documentation efforts but also facilitate broader access to linguistic resources for researchers, communities, and educators. Case studies from various global linguistic contexts illustrate the practical applications and benefits of these innovations, highlighting their potential to support the preservation and revitalization of endangered languages. The paper also discusses the ethical considerations and challenges associated with the adoption of these technologies, emphasizing the importance of community engagement and data sovereignty."}
