{"Abstract": "This study investigates the cross-linguistic patterns of prosodic prominence, focusing on the interplay between pitch accent and lexical stress across a diverse set of languages. Utilizing the Rapid Prosody Transcription (RPT) method, we analyzed spoken data from 15 languages representing various prosodic typologies, including stress-timed, syllable-timed, and mora-timed systems. The findings reveal that while the realization of prosodic prominence varies significantly, there are common underlying principles that govern its distribution. Metrical phonology provides a robust framework for understanding these patterns, highlighting the role of phonological structure in shaping prosodic contours. The study also identifies language-specific strategies for marking prominence, such as the use of pitch, duration, and intensity, which contribute to the rich tapestry of prosodic typology. These insights have implications for both theoretical models of prosody and practical applications in speech technology and language teaching."}
