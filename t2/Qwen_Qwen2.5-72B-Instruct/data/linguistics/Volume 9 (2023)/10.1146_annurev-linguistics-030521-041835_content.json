{"Abstract": "This study investigates adjective ordering preferences across languages, focusing on the cross-linguistic regularities in word order and modification. By analyzing a diverse set of languages, the research identifies consistent patterns in the sequence of adjectives, such as size, age, color, and origin, when they modify a noun. The findings suggest that while there is variability, certain universal principles guide the ordering of adjectives, reflecting cognitive and communicative constraints. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of linguistic structure and the cognitive processes underlying language use."}
