{"Abstract": "This study explores the typology of reciprocal constructions across diverse languages, focusing on the morphosyntactic mechanisms that encode reciprocal relationships. By analyzing the symmetry and valency of reciprocal verbs, the research identifies key patterns and variations in how languages represent mutual actions. The findings reveal that while some languages employ dedicated reciprocal markers, others rely on reflexive or passive constructions. This cross-linguistic investigation contributes to a deeper understanding of the structural and functional aspects of reciprocal constructions, highlighting the complex interplay between semantics and syntax."}
