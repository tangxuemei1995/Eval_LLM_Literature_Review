{"Abstract": "This paper explores effective methodologies for analyzing (psycho)linguistic data, emphasizing the integration of Bayesian methods and hypothesis testing. We discuss the advantages of Bayesian approaches in quantifying uncertainty and providing a more nuanced understanding of experimental results. Through case studies, we illustrate how Bayes factors can be used to evaluate competing hypotheses, offering a robust alternative to traditional null hypothesis significance testing. The paper also highlights the importance of proper data preprocessing and model selection, advocating for transparent and reproducible research practices. By adopting these right ways, researchers can enhance the reliability and interpretability of their findings in experimental linguistics."}
