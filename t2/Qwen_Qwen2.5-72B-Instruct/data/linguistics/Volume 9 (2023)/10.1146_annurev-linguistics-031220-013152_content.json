{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of language and environmental knowledge, focusing on the Tuva region, where traditional ecological knowledge and native science are deeply embedded in the local language. By analyzing linguistic data and conducting interviews with indigenous communities, the research highlights the role of language in preserving biodiversity and environmental intelligence. The findings suggest that decolonization efforts in linguistics can enhance the recognition and integration of indigenous knowledge systems, contributing to more sustainable environmental practices. The study underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in environmental linguistics, bridging the gap between linguistic studies and ecological conservation."}
