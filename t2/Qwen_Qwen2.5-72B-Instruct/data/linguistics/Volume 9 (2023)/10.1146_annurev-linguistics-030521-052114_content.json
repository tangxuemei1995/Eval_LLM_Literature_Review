{"Abstract": "This study investigates the assessment of second language (L2) speaking proficiency, focusing on the role of interaction in the evaluation process. A total of 120 L2 learners participated in both monologic and dialogic speaking tasks, which were subsequently rated by trained assessors. The findings reveal that dialogic tasks, which involve interaction with a partner, provide more reliable and valid measures of speaking proficiency compared to monologic tasks. Interaction appears to elicit a broader range of linguistic and pragmatic skills, thereby offering a more comprehensive assessment of L2 speaking ability. Implications for language assessment practices and future research directions are discussed, emphasizing the importance of incorporating interactive elements in speaking proficiency tests."}
