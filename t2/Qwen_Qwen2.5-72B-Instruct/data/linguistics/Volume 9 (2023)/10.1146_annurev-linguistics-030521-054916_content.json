{"Abstract": "This paper examines the sociolinguistic landscape of North Africa, focusing on the recognition and institutionalization of Tamazight amidst a complex multilingual and multicultural environment. The region's linguistic heritage, characterized by the coexistence of Arabic, Tamazight, and DƒÅrija, has been shaped by historical colonization and ongoing revitalization efforts. The study highlights the challenges and opportunities presented by the formal recognition of Tamazight, including its impact on education, governance, and social cohesion. It also explores the implications of multilingualism and multiculturalism for identity and integration in North African societies."}
