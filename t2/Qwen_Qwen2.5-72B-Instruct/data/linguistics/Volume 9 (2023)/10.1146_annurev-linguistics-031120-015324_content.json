{"Abstract": "This paper explores the multifaceted dimensions of ethics in the field of linguistics, emphasizing the integration of ethical praxis, regulatory ethics, and relational ethics to ensure scientific validity. Ethical praxis involves the application of ethical principles in the day-to-day conduct of linguistic research, ensuring that studies are conducted with integrity and respect for participants. Regulatory ethics focuses on adherence to established guidelines and laws, safeguarding the rights and well-being of research subjects. Relational ethics highlights the importance of building trust and maintaining respectful relationships with communities and individuals involved in linguistic studies. By balancing these ethical dimensions, linguists can enhance the credibility and reliability of their research, fostering a more responsible and inclusive scientific community."}
