{"Abstract": "This paper explores the linguistic and cognitive dimensions of animal communication, drawing on historical and contemporary research. By examining the seminal works of Washburn and Ladygina-Kohts, we provide a comparative analysis of communication systems across species, highlighting the cognitive underpinnings that support these systems. We also integrate Grice's cooperative principles to assess the intentional and contextual aspects of animal signals. The paper further investigates the presence of duality of patterning and generativity in animal communication, key features that distinguish human language from other forms of communication. Through this interdisciplinary approach, we aim to elucidate the extent to which animal communication systems share structural and functional similarities with human language, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of the evolution of linguistic and cognitive abilities."}
