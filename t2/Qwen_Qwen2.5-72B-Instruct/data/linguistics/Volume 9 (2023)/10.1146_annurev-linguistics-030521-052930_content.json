{"Abstract": "This paper explores the intersection of postcolonial language policy and planning (LPP) and the conceptual limitations of the modern nation-state, with a particular focus on Sudan. Drawing on Southern perspectives, the study critically examines how postcolonial contexts challenge the conventional frameworks of LPP, which are often rooted in Western notions of the nation-state. By analyzing the linguistic landscape and policy implementations in Sudan, the paper highlights the complexities and contradictions that arise when attempting to fit postcolonial societies into the rigid structures of the modern state. The research underscores the need for a more nuanced and context-sensitive approach to LPP that acknowledges the historical, cultural, and political specificities of postcolonial settings. This study contributes to a broader understanding of the limitations of the nation-state model in addressing the diverse linguistic needs and identities of postcolonial societies."}
