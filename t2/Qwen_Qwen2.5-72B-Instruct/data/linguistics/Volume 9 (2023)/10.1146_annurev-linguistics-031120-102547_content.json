{"Abstract": "This study explores the nuanced use of impersonal pronouns in expressing first-person perspectives, particularly within the context of attitude reports. Drawing on a corpus of contemporary texts, we analyze how impersonal pronouns can convey de se attitudes, which are self-ascriptions of properties or states. The investigation reveals that impersonal pronouns, while typically devoid of specific referential content, can serve as a means to express generic or indexical meanings that are closely tied to the speaker's own perspective. This finding challenges the traditional view that impersonal pronouns are strictly non-referential and suggests a more dynamic role in linguistic communication. The study also discusses the implications of these findings for theories of indexicality and genericity, highlighting the complex interplay between linguistic form and cognitive perspective."}
