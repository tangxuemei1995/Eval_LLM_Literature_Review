{"Abstract": "The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework is a probabilistic model of pragmatics that aims to explain how speakers and listeners use context to infer meaning in communication. By integrating principles from game theory, decision theory, and Bayesian inference, the RSA framework provides a computational account of how speakers optimize their utterances to convey intended meanings and how listeners interpret these utterances based on the likelihood of different interpretations. This framework has been applied to a wide range of linguistic phenomena, including scalar implicatures, referential expressions, and metaphorical language. Experimental studies have shown that the RSA model accurately predicts human behavior in various communicative tasks, providing strong support for its theoretical underpinnings. The RSA framework not only advances our understanding of how context influences language use but also has implications for the development of more sophisticated natural language processing systems."}
