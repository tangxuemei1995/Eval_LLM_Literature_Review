{"Abstract": "This study explores the challenges and methodologies involved in verb classification across diverse languages, a critical aspect of multilingual natural language processing (NLP). We investigate the effectiveness of knowledge augmentation techniques in enhancing neural models for verb classification tasks. By integrating crowdsourced linguistic data from speakers of various languages, we aim to enrich the training datasets and improve model performance. Our findings indicate that incorporating domain-specific and culturally relevant verb categories through crowdsourcing significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of verb classification models. This research contributes to the development of more inclusive and effective multilingual NLP systems, paving the way for better cross-linguistic understanding and communication."}
