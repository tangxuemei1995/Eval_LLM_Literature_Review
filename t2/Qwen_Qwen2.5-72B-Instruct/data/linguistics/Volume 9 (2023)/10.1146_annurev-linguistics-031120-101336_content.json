{"Abstract": "The actuation problem, a central issue in sociolinguistics, concerns the mechanisms by which sound changes are initiated and spread within a speech community. This study explores the interplay between incrementation, propagation, and individual differences in cognitive processing styles, using agent-based modeling to simulate the dynamics of sound change. We argue that individual differences in cognitive processing, such as attention to detail and sensitivity to social cues, play a crucial role in the actuation and propagation of linguistic innovations. The model incorporates variables representing these cognitive factors and simulates interactions within a virtual speech community. Results indicate that individuals with a more analytical cognitive style are more likely to initiate sound changes, while those with a more holistic style facilitate the propagation of these changes through social networks. The findings highlight the importance of considering individual cognitive differences in understanding the mechanisms of linguistic change and provide a framework for future empirical research. This interdisciplinary approach bridges the gap between sociolinguistics and cognitive science, offering new insights into the complex processes underlying the actuation problem."}
