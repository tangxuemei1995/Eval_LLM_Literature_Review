{"Abstract": "This paper explores the development and evaluation of computational models for anaphora resolution, focusing on coreference and bridging reference. We review recent advancements in neural models and their application to large annotated corpora, highlighting their effectiveness in handling complex discourse phenomena such as discourse deixis. The paper also discusses the challenges posed by the Winograd Schema Challenge, which tests a model's ability to resolve anaphora in context-dependent scenarios. Our analysis underscores the importance of integrating linguistic and contextual information to improve the accuracy of anaphora resolution systems."}
