{"Abstract": "This study investigates the role of speech prosody in individuals diagnosed with various mental disorders, focusing on both prosody recognition and production. Prosody, the melody and rhythm of speech, is a critical component in conveying pragmatic and affective information. Individuals with mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder, often exhibit altered prosodic patterns, which can impact social communication and interpersonal relationships. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical data from speech samples, this research highlights the specific prosodic features that are commonly affected in these disorders. The findings suggest that deficits in prosody production, such as reduced pitch variation and abnormal intonation, are prevalent, while prosody recognition, particularly in identifying emotional cues, is also impaired. These insights have implications for the development of diagnostic tools and therapeutic interventions aimed at improving social communication skills in individuals with mental disorders."}
