{"Abstract": "This study explores the critical role of communication in the physicianâ€“patient relationship and its impact on treatment outcomes. Utilizing conversation analysis, we examine the nuances of social interaction during medical consultations, focusing on the processes of negotiation and decision-making. The findings highlight the importance of effective communication strategies in enhancing patient understanding, engagement, and adherence to treatment plans. Improved communication not only fosters a more collaborative environment but also leads to better health outcomes and patient satisfaction. The implications of this research underscore the need for training programs that equip healthcare providers with the skills necessary to navigate complex social interactions and support informed decision-making."}
