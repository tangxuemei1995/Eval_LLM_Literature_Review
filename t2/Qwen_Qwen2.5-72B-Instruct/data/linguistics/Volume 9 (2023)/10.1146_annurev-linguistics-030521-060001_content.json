{"Abstract": "This paper explores the contested issues surrounding homesign, a form of sign language developed by deaf individuals who lack exposure to a conventional sign language. Through a linguistic ethnographic approach, the study examines the sociolinguistic dynamics that influence the emergence and structure of homesign systems. Key debates include the extent to which homesigns exhibit systematic linguistic properties, their role in the broader deaf community, and the implications for language acquisition theories. The research highlights the variability in homesign systems and the impact of social interaction on their development, challenging the notion of a universal grammar. Findings suggest that homesigns are dynamic and context-dependent, reflecting the unique communicative needs and environmental factors of their creators."}
