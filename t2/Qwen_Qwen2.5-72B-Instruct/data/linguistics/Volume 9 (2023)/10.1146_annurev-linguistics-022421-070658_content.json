{"Abstract": "This study investigates the phenomenon of hyperraising, a syntactic process where a subject appears to move out of a finite clause, challenging traditional assumptions about the limits of movement. Through a comprehensive analysis of crosslinguistic data, the study evaluates various theoretical approaches, including defectiveness/nonphase analyses, deactivation analyses, and phase-edge analyses. The findings suggest that hyperraising is not uniformly defective across languages, and its occurrence is influenced by the specific phase properties of the embedding clause. The study also highlights the importance of considering language-specific factors in understanding the distribution and acceptability of hyperraising constructions. These insights contribute to a more nuanced understanding of syntactic movement and the role of phases in shaping crosslinguistic variation."}
