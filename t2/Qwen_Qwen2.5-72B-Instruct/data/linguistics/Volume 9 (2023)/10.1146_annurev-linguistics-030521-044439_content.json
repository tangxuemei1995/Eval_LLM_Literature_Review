{"Abstract": "This paper explores the role of compositionality in computational linguistics, focusing on how neural networks and neurosymbolic models can be leveraged to enhance semantic parsing. Compositionality, the principle that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its constituents and the rules used to combine them, is crucial for building robust and interpretable natural language processing systems. We review recent advances in neurosymbolic models that integrate symbolic reasoning with neural network architectures, demonstrating their effectiveness in capturing compositional structures. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that these models outperform purely neural approaches in tasks requiring compositional generalization, such as semantic parsing and question answering."}
