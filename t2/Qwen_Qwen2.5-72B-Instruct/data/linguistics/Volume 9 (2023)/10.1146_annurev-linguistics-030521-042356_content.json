{"Abstract": "This study explores the unity and diversity of Altaic languages through the lenses of diachronic, areal, and contextual linguistics. By examining the historical development and typological interaction of these languages, we identify patterns of language contacts and structural convergences that have shaped their current forms. The analysis reveals that while Altaic languages share common ancestral roots, they have also undergone significant typological changes due to prolonged contact with neighboring language families. This research underscores the importance of considering both genetic and areal factors in understanding the complex linguistic landscape of the Altaic region. The findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of how language families evolve and interact over time, providing valuable insights for future research in diachronic and areal linguistics."}
