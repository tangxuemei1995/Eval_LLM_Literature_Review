{"Abstract": "This review synthesizes recent advancements in the understanding of Chinese developmental dyslexia, focusing on linguistic profiles, brain abnormalities, and genetic susceptibility. Studies have identified unique linguistic challenges in Chinese dyslexic readers, such as difficulties with character recognition and phonological processing, which differ from those observed in alphabetic languages. Neuroimaging research has revealed specific brain regions, including the left middle frontal gyrus and the left occipito-temporal area, that exhibit atypical activation patterns in dyslexic individuals. Genetic studies have also pinpointed several susceptibility genes, such as DCDC2 and KIAA0319, which may contribute to the development of dyslexia in Chinese populations. These findings highlight both language-universal and language-specific aspects of dyslexia, providing a comprehensive framework for future research and intervention strategies."}
