{"Abstract": "This paper explores the role of opacity in phonological theory, specifically within the frameworks of Optimality Theory (OT) and Harmonic Serialism (HS). Opacity, the phenomenon where the output of one phonological rule is not transparent to another, poses significant challenges to the parallel evaluation of constraints in OT. HS, on the other hand, addresses opacity by positing a step-by-step application of constraints, allowing for a more nuanced treatment of rule ordering. This study compares the explanatory power of OT and HS in accounting for opaque phenomena across various languages, highlighting the advantages and limitations of each approach. Through a detailed analysis of case studies, we demonstrate that HS provides a more transparent and computationally efficient model for handling opacity, while also maintaining the constraint-based architecture of OT. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying phonological rule interactions and the nature of phonological computation."}
