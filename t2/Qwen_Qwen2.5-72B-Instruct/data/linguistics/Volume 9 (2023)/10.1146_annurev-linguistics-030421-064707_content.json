{"Abstract": "This paper explores the multifaceted domain of constructed languages (conlangs), encompassing both philosophical languages and international auxiliary languages. It delves into the historical and cognitive motivations behind the creation of these languages, with a particular focus on Esperanto, one of the most widely used and studied conlangs. The review integrates insights from psycholinguistics to examine how constructed languages influence cognitive processes, language acquisition, and communication. The paper also discusses the role of conlangs in fostering cross-cultural understanding and their potential applications in education and international diplomacy. By synthesizing findings from various disciplines, this study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on constructed languages and highlight avenues for future investigation."}
