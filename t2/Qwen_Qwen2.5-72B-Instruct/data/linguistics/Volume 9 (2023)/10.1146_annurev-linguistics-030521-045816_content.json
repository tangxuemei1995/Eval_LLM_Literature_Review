{"Abstract": "This study investigates the impact of socioeconomic status (SES) on language processing and development, focusing on the role of parental input in shaping syntactic parsing and communication skills. Drawing from a longitudinal dataset of children aged 2 to 5 years, we examine how variations in SES correlate with differences in language acquisition and usage. Results indicate that children from higher SES backgrounds exhibit more advanced syntactic parsing abilities and a richer vocabulary, which are strongly associated with the quantity and quality of parental linguistic input. Sociolinguistic analysis reveals that higher SES parents tend to use more complex sentence structures and engage in more frequent and diverse conversations with their children. These findings underscore the importance of early language exposure and suggest potential interventions to mitigate disparities in language development across SES backgrounds."}
