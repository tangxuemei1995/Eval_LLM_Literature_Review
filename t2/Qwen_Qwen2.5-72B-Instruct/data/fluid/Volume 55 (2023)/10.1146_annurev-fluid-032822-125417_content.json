{"Abstract": "This study explores the complex dynamics of gas-liquid foams, integrating insights from interfacial mechanics, rheology, and fluid mechanics. By examining the structural elements of foams, including the behavior of thin films and the interactions between bubbles, we develop a comprehensive framework that bridges the gap between microscopic and macroscopic descriptions. The rheological properties of foams are analyzed, highlighting the role of viscoelasticity and the impact of foam structure on flow behavior. The continuum approach is employed to model foam dynamics, incorporating the effects of surface tension, viscosity, and bubble size distribution. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of foam stability and flow, with implications for applications in soft matter physics and industrial processes such as froth flotation and foam fractionation."}
