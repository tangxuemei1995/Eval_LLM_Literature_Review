{"Abstract": "This study explores the formation and stability of particle rafts and armored droplets, focusing on the interplay between capillarity, buoyancy, and interfacial rheology. Particle-laden interfaces exhibit unique mechanical properties due to the self-assembly of particles at fluid interfaces, which can lead to the formation of robust, elastic structures. We investigate how the size, shape, and surface properties of particles influence the formation and stability of these structures. Through a combination of experimental observations and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate that the elastic modulus of particle rafts is significantly enhanced by the capillary forces that arise from the curvature of the fluid interface. Additionally, we examine the role of buoyancy in the formation of armored droplets, where a dense layer of particles encapsulates a liquid core, providing mechanical protection and altering the droplet's rheological behavior. Our findings have implications for a wide range of applications, including the design of microcapsules, emulsion stabilization, and the development of new materials with tunable mechanical properties."}
