{"Abstract": "This study investigates the complex dynamics of three-dimensional shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions (SWBLI) in supersonic and hypersonic flows. The interaction between the shock wave and the boundary layer is a critical phenomenon that significantly affects the aerodynamic performance and structural integrity of high-speed vehicles. The research employs a combination of experimental measurements, numerical simulations, and theoretical analysis to explore the mechanisms of turbulence, separation, and shear layer development. Key findings include the identification of instability modes that govern the transition from laminar to turbulent flow, the influence of three-dimensional effects on shock-induced separation, and the role of fluid/structure interactions in modifying the flow field. The study also evaluates various flow control techniques, such as micro-vortex generators and plasma actuators, to mitigate adverse effects and enhance flow stability. These results provide valuable insights for the design and optimization of high-speed aerospace systems, contributing to advancements in flow control and aerodynamic performance."}
