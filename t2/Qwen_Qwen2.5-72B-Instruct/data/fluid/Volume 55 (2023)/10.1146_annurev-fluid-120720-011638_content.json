{"Abstract": "This study investigates the dynamics of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow within the central nervous system, focusing on the role of biological fluid mechanics and the glymphatic system. Utilizing advanced imaging techniques and computational fluid dynamics, we analyzed the patterns of CSF movement, particularly the viscous flow characteristics that facilitate waste clearance and nutrient distribution. Our findings highlight the importance of the glymphatic system in maintaining brain homeostasis and suggest potential therapeutic targets for neurological disorders associated with impaired CSF flow. The results contribute to a deeper understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying CSF circulation and its implications for brain health."}
