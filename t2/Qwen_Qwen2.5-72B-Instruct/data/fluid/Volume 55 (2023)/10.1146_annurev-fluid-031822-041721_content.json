{"Abstract": "This study presents an advanced 3D Lagrangian particle tracking method for fluid mechanics, utilizing iterative particle reconstruction techniques such as Shake-The-Box. The method enables the accurate reconstruction of particle trajectories in complex fluid flows, providing detailed insights into one- and multipoint statistics. By analyzing the velocity gradient tensor, the technique offers a comprehensive understanding of fluid dynamics, including the identification of vortices and strain fields. Additionally, the integration of 3D pressure field data through data assimilation enhances the accuracy of the reconstructed flow fields. The results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in capturing the intricate dynamics of turbulent flows, making it a valuable tool for both experimental and numerical studies in fluid mechanics."}
