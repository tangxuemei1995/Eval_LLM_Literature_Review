{"Abstract": "This paper provides an in-depth perspective on the current state of aerospace computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technology, highlighting its advancements and the challenges it faces in industrial applications. Recent developments in high-fidelity simulations, turbulence modeling, and multiphysics coupling have significantly enhanced the predictive capabilities of CFD. However, issues such as computational cost, model accuracy, and the integration of CFD with other design tools remain critical barriers to its widespread adoption. The future of aerospace CFD is likely to be shaped by emerging technologies, including machine learning, exascale computing, and cloud-based platforms, which promise to address these challenges and revolutionize the field."}
