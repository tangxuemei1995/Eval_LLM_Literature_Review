{"Abstract": "This review summarizes recent advancements in the theories of inhomogeneous and anisotropic turbulence, focusing on quasi-linear approaches and statistical methods. Key developments include refined models for turbulence in geophysical and astrophysical contexts, enhanced predictive capabilities for engineering applications, and improved understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms. The integration of experimental data and high-fidelity simulations is highlighted as crucial for validating theoretical predictions."}
