{"Abstract": "This study investigates the self-propulsion mechanisms of chemically active droplets, which act as microswimmers in various fluid environments. By leveraging Marangoni flows induced by surface tension gradients, these active droplets exhibit spontaneous symmetry-breaking, leading to directed motion. The interplay between advectionâ€“diffusion processes and viscous flows is crucial for understanding the dynamics of these systems. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the chemical activity at the droplet interface generates concentration gradients that drive the Marangoni flows, propelling the droplets. The results highlight the importance of controlling the chemical reactivity and the physical properties of the droplets to optimize their locomotion. This research has implications for the design of microscale devices and the development of new strategies for cargo transport in microfluidic systems."}
