{"Abstract": "Submesoscale dynamics, characterized by processes occurring at spatial scales of 0.1 to 10 kilometers, play a crucial role in the upper ocean's energy and material fluxes. This study investigates the mechanisms driving submesoscale turbulence, eddies, and fronts, and their implications for oceanic and atmospheric interactions. Using high-resolution numerical simulations and in-situ observations, we explore how submesoscale features modulate heat, momentum, and nutrient transport. Our findings reveal that submesoscale processes significantly enhance vertical mixing and horizontal advection, contributing to the redistribution of heat and nutrients in the upper ocean. These dynamics are particularly important in regions of strong frontal activity, where they can influence local and regional climate patterns. Understanding these processes is essential for improving climate models and predicting the ocean's response to global environmental changes."}
