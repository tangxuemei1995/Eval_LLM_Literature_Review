{"Abstract": "The global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has highlighted the critical role of face masks in mitigating the airborne transmission of respiratory infections. This study investigates the flow physics of face masks, focusing on the mechanisms by which they reduce the dispersion of respiratory droplets and aerosols. Using a combination of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and experimental measurements, we analyze the effectiveness of various mask materials and designs in filtering particles and altering airflow patterns. The results show that masks significantly reduce the velocity and range of exhaled droplets, with higher filtration efficiencies observed in N95 respirators compared to surgical and cloth masks. However, the study also reveals that the fit and seal of the mask are crucial factors in determining its overall effectiveness. The findings provide valuable insights into the optimal design and use of face masks to minimize the risk of respiratory infection transmission, particularly in indoor environments where airborne transmission is a significant concern."}
