{"Abstract": "This study provides new insights into the dynamics and evolution of turbulent spots in various flow configurations, including boundary layers, pipe flow, channel flow, plane Couette flow, turbomachinery flow, and hypersonic flow. Through a combination of direct numerical simulations and experimental observations, we elucidate the mechanisms governing the formation, growth, and breakdown of turbulent spots during the transition from laminar to turbulent flow. Key findings include the identification of critical Reynolds number thresholds for spot initiation, the role of streamwise vortices in spot propagation, and the influence of wall curvature and compressibility effects on spot morphology. These results enhance our understanding of the complex interplay between coherent structures and turbulence, offering valuable implications for flow control and turbulence modeling in engineering applications."}
