{"Abstract": "Rotating Detonation Engines (RDEs) represent a promising advancement in propulsion technology, leveraging pressure gain combustion to achieve higher efficiency and performance compared to conventional gas turbines. However, the practical implementation of RDEs is hindered by several nonidealities that can significantly impact their performance. This study investigates key nonidealities, including unsteady mixing, secondary combustion, deflagration loss, and the presence of multiple competing waves. Unsteady mixing, characterized by the temporal and spatial variations in fuel and oxidizer distribution, can lead to incomplete combustion and reduced efficiency. Secondary combustion, occurring in regions where the primary detonation wave has already passed, can further complicate the combustion process and introduce additional losses. Deflagration loss, where the combustion process transitions from a detonation to a deflagration, can severely degrade the pressure gain and overall performance. Additionally, the presence of multiple competing waves, including secondary waves, can lead to instabilities and reduced engine operability. This research provides a comprehensive analysis of these nonidealities, offering insights into their mechanisms and potential mitigation strategies to enhance the reliability and efficiency of RDEs."}
