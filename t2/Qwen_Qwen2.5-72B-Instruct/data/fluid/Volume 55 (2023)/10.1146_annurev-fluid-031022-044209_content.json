{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of mathematical techniques from quantum mechanics to the field of linear flow analysis. By leveraging concepts such as symmetries, degeneracy, and exceptional points, we develop a novel framework for analyzing the stability and spectral properties of linear systems. The approach integrates perturbation theory and eigenvalue analysis to provide a deeper understanding of system behavior under various conditions. Our findings reveal that the incorporation of quantum mechanical methods enhances the precision and robustness of linear flow analysis, offering new insights into the dynamics of complex systems. This interdisciplinary approach not only broadens the theoretical foundation of linear analysis but also opens avenues for practical applications in engineering and physics."}
