{"Abstract": "The transition to turbulence in pipe flow is a complex phenomenon characterized by the interplay of shear flow, transient growth, and the dynamics of turbulent puffs and slugs. This study investigates the mechanisms underlying the onset of turbulence, focusing on the role of intermittency and transient chaos. Using a combination of experimental observations and numerical simulations, we explore the critical conditions under which laminar flow becomes unstable, leading to the formation and propagation of turbulent structures. Our findings suggest that the transition process can be described by a model of directed percolation, providing new insights into the universal aspects of this transition."}
