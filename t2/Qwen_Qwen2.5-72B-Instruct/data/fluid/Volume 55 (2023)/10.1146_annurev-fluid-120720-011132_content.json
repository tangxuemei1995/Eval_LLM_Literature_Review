{"Abstract": "This study investigates the dynamics of particles, drops, and bubbles in stratified fluids, focusing on their behavior within the pycnocline. The interaction between microorganisms and the stratified environment is also explored, highlighting the impact on particle-laden flows. Experimental and numerical methods are employed to analyze the vertical and horizontal motion of these elements, revealing the complex interplay between buoyancy, turbulence, and fluid density gradients. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of stratified flow phenomena, with implications for environmental and industrial applications, such as oceanography and chemical processing."}
