{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of sharp interface methods for the simulation and analysis of free surface flows characterized by singularities, focusing on the phenomena of breakup and coalescence. Utilizing advanced numerical techniques, including finite element methods, the research addresses the complex dynamics of drops, jets, and filaments, which are critical in applications such as ink jet printing, microfluidics, and sprays. The paper presents a detailed examination of the pinch-off process, where a liquid filament breaks into smaller droplets, and the coalescence of droplets, where multiple droplets merge into a single entity. The methods developed in this study accurately capture the evolution of the free surface and the formation of singularities, providing insights into the underlying physical mechanisms. The results demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the sharp interface approach in handling the intricate geometries and rapid changes in topology associated with these phenomena, offering a valuable tool for both fundamental research and industrial applications."}
