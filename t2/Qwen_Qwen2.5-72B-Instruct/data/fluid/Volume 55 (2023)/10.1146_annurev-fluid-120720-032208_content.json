{"Abstract": "This study investigates the fluid dynamics of polar vortices on Earth, Mars, and Titan, focusing on the role of potential vorticity and Rossby waves in shaping atmospheric circulation. Using a comparative planetology approach, we analyze high-resolution atmospheric data and numerical simulations to elucidate the mechanisms governing vortex formation, stability, and variability. Our findings reveal that despite significant differences in planetary environments, the underlying principles of vortex dynamics are remarkably consistent across these bodies. Potential vorticity plays a crucial role in maintaining the structure and longevity of polar vortices, while Rossby waves contribute to their seasonal and interannual variability. These insights enhance our understanding of atmospheric processes on diverse planetary bodies and provide a foundation for predicting future changes in polar climates."}
