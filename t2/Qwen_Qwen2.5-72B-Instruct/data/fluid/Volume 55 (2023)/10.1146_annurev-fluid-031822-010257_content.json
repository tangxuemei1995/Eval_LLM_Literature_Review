{"Abstract": "This study investigates the fluid mechanics associated with deep-sea mining, focusing on sediment transport, plume dynamics, and their environmental impacts. Utilizing principles from physical oceanography, the research examines the formation and behavior of sediment plumes generated by mining activities. The study employs numerical models and field observations to analyze the dispersion and settling of particulate matter, including the role of flocculation in altering particle size and settling velocity. Turbidity currents, which can transport sediments over long distances, are also explored to understand their potential to affect benthic ecosystems. The findings highlight the need for robust environmental monitoring and management strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of deep-sea mining on marine environments."}
