{"Abstract": "This study explores the impact of tabletop experiments on advancing scientific research and education, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and resource-constrained settings. By focusing on the development and implementation of cost-effective, high-impact tabletop experiments, we aim to enhance access to cutting-edge scientific tools and methodologies. Our findings indicate that these experiments not only facilitate hands-on learning and innovation but also play a crucial role in the professional development of early-career researchers and graduate students. The study highlights successful case studies and provides recommendations for integrating tabletop experiments into curricula and research programs, thereby fostering a more inclusive and equitable scientific community."}
