{"Abstract": "Elasto-inertial turbulence (EIT) is a complex flow phenomenon that arises in viscoelastic fluids under conditions where both elastic and inertial forces are significant. This study investigates the mechanisms of elastic instabilities and the formation of coherent structures in transitional flows, using advanced numerical simulations and viscoelastic models. The research highlights the role of polymer drag reduction in mitigating turbulence and the conditions under which elastic turbulence emerges. Key findings include the identification of critical Weissenberg and Reynolds numbers that delineate the onset of EIT. The simulations reveal that elastic instabilities can lead to the formation of elongated vortices and streamwise streaks, which are characteristic of elastic turbulence. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the underlying physics and have implications for the design of polymer solutions in industrial and environmental applications, such as drag reduction in pipelines and enhanced oil recovery techniques."}
