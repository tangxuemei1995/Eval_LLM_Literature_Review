{"Abstract": "This paper explores the development of fluid mechanics in France during the first half of the twentieth century, a period marked by significant advancements and the emergence of aeronautics as a key application area. The study traces the evolution of theoretical and experimental approaches, highlighting the contributions of prominent French scientists and engineers such as Jean Boussinesq, Paul Richard, and Georges Prandtl (who, although German, had a profound influence on French fluid mechanics through his work and collaborations). The paper also examines the role of institutions like the Ã‰cole Polytechnique and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) in fostering research and innovation. The impact of World War I on the field is discussed, particularly the acceleration of aeronautical research and the development of wind tunnels and other experimental facilities. By the 1930s, French fluid mechanics had established a strong foundation, contributing to both military and civilian applications, and setting the stage for further advancements in the post-war era."}
