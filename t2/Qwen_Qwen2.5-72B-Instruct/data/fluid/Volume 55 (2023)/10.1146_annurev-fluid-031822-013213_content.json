{"Abstract": "This study investigates the evaporation dynamics of sessile droplets, focusing on diffusion-limited processes and the impact of multiple droplets on evaporation modes. Mathematical models are developed to predict droplet lifetimes and deposition patterns, revealing the interplay between droplet geometry and environmental conditions. The findings enhance understanding of complex evaporation phenomena, with implications for various applications including inkjet printing and microfluidics."}
