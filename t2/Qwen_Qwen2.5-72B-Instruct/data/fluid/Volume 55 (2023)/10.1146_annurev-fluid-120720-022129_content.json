{"Abstract": "Immersed Boundary Methods (IBMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for simulating complex flows and multiphysics problems, particularly in scenarios where the geometry of the domain is intricate or dynamically changing. Originating from the pioneering work of Peskin in the 1970s, IBMs have evolved to address a wide range of applications, from cardiovascular flows to fluid-structure interaction in engineering systems. This review provides a historical perspective on the development of IBMs, highlighting key advancements in numerical techniques and wall models that have enhanced their accuracy and efficiency. Recent developments in high-fidelity simulations and the integration of machine learning algorithms have further expanded the capabilities of IBMs, enabling more realistic and computationally efficient modeling of complex systems. Looking forward, the future outlook for IBMs includes the exploration of adaptive mesh refinement, enhanced coupling with other numerical methods, and the application to emerging fields such as microfluidics and biological systems. The ongoing research aims to address the challenges of scalability and robustness, ensuring that IBMs remain a versatile and indispensable tool in the simulation of multiphysics problems."}
