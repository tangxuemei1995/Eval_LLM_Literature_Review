{"Abstract": "This study investigates the complex dynamics of turbulent rotating Rayleigh–Bénard convection, a fundamental process in fluid dynamics characterized by the interaction of buoyancy-driven convection and Coriolis forces. Through a combination of direct numerical simulations, theoretical analysis, and experimental measurements, we explore the impact of rotation on heat transport and flow structure. The results reveal that rotation significantly alters the convective patterns, leading to the formation of large-scale coherent structures and a reduction in the Nusselt number, which quantifies the efficiency of heat transfer. The transition from non-rotating to rotating convection is marked by a shift in the scaling laws governing the heat flux, indicating a change in the dominant transport mechanisms. These findings provide new insights into the role of rotation in enhancing or suppressing turbulence and heat transport, with implications for a wide range of natural and industrial processes, including geophysical flows and thermal management systems."}
