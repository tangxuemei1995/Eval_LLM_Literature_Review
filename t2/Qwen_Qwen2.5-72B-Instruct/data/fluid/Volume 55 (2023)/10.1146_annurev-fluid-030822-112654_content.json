{"Abstract": "Irmgard Flügge-Lotz (1903–1974) was a pioneering figure in the field of fluid mechanics, particularly renowned for her contributions to flow computation and the study of compressible boundary layers. Born in Hamelin, Germany, Flügge-Lotz conducted her early research at the University of Göttingen, a hub of scientific innovation during the early 20th century. Her work significantly advanced the understanding of aerodynamics and control theory, areas critical to the development of modern aviation. Flügge-Lotz's innovative methods for solving complex flow problems laid the groundwork for computational fluid dynamics, a field that has since become indispensable in engineering and physics. Despite the challenges faced by women in science during her time, Flügge-Lotz's achievements earned her international recognition and a professorship at Stanford University, where she continued to mentor and inspire future generations of engineers and scientists. This biography highlights her groundbreaking research and her enduring legacy in the field of fluid mechanics."}
