{"Abstract": "This study investigates the accelerating rate of iceberg melting in the context of global climate change, focusing on its implications for the cryosphere and sea level rise. Utilizing a combination of satellite imagery, in-situ measurements, and climate models, we analyze the thermal and mechanical processes driving the disintegration of icebergs in the ocean. Our findings reveal a significant increase in iceberg melt rates over the past two decades, attributed to rising ocean temperatures and altered ocean currents. The study also highlights the cascading effects of iceberg melting on marine ecosystems and global climate patterns. The projected scenarios suggest that continued warming could lead to a substantial contribution to sea level rise, emphasizing the urgent need for comprehensive climate mitigation strategies. This research underscores the critical role of icebergs in the global cryosphere and their sensitivity to environmental changes."}
