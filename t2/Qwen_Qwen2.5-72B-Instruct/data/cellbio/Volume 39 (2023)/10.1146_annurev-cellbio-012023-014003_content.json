{"Abstract": "The Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, has emerged as a powerful model system in cell and developmental biology, particularly in the field of evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo). This species comprises both surface-dwelling and cave-dwelling morphs, providing a unique opportunity to study the genetic and developmental mechanisms underlying adaptive evolution. The cave-dwelling morphs exhibit a range of regressive traits, such as the loss of eyes and pigmentation, alongside constructive traits like enhanced sensory systems. Recent advances in genomic and molecular techniques have facilitated the identification of key genes and pathways involved in these evolutionary changes. This review highlights the use of Astyanax as a model to investigate the genetic basis of trait divergence, the role of developmental plasticity in adaptation, and the interplay between genetic and environmental factors in shaping phenotypic diversity. The insights gained from studying Astyanax not only contribute to our understanding of evolutionary processes but also have broader implications for fields such as regenerative medicine and sensory biology."}
