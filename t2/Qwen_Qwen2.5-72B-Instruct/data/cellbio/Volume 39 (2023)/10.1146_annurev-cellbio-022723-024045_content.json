{"Abstract": "This study employs advanced fluorescence microscopy to track the dynamic lifecycle of mRNAs in single cells, from transcription and splicing to localization, translation, and decay. By integrating high-resolution imaging with computational analysis, we reveal the intricate spatiotemporal regulation of mRNA metabolism, highlighting the heterogeneity and complexity of gene expression at the single-cell level. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms governing mRNA fate and cellular function."}
