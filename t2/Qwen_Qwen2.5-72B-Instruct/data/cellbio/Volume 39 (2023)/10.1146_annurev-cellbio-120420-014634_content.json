{"Abstract": "The RBG Motif Bridge-Like Lipid Transport Proteins (BLTPs), including VPS13, ATG2, tweek, hobbit, and SHIP164, represent a unique class of proteins involved in lipid transport across non-contiguous membranes. These proteins share a conserved RBG motif and a bridge-like structure, facilitating the transfer of lipids between organelles without direct membrane fusion. VPS13 and ATG2 are crucial for autophagy and endosomal trafficking, while tweek and hobbit play roles in lipid homeostasis and signaling pathways. SHIP164, a recently identified member, has been implicated in phosphoinositide metabolism. Despite their structural and functional similarities, the specific mechanisms by which these proteins mediate lipid transport and their regulatory interactions remain poorly understood. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the structure and functions of BLTPs, highlighting key findings and addressing open questions that warrant further investigation."}
