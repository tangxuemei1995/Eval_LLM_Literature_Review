{"Abstract": "The Target of Rapamycin Complex 2 (TORC2) is a critical protein kinase that regulates various cellular processes, including cell growth, polarity, and stress responses in yeast. This study elucidates the mechanisms governing the function and localization of TORC2, focusing on its subunits and their interactions with the plasma membrane (PM) and endosomes. We demonstrate that the localization of TORC2 to the PM is facilitated by phosphoinositides, which are essential for the recruitment and activation of the complex. Furthermore, we identify specific phosphorylation events that modulate the activity and subcellular distribution of TORC2 subunits. Our findings reveal that the dynamic interplay between phosphoinositides and phosphorylation events is crucial for the proper regulation of TORC2, highlighting the importance of these mechanisms in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental cues."}
