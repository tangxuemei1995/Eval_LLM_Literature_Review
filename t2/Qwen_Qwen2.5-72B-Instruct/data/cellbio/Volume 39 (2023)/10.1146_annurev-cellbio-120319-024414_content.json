{"Abstract": "The intricate and diverse skin color patterns observed in vertebrates have long fascinated biologists and mathematicians alike. This study explores the application of reaction-diffusion models, originally proposed by Alan Turing, to explain the formation of these patterns. By integrating phenomenological models with cellular automata, we demonstrate how simple chemical interactions and diffusion processes can generate complex and stable patterns, such as stripes, spots, and labyrinthine designs. Our simulations reveal that the sequential patterning of skin color is highly sensitive to initial conditions and parameter variations, providing insights into the evolutionary adaptability of these patterns. The findings not only support the theoretical framework of Turing patterns but also highlight the potential of reaction-diffusion mechanisms in understanding the development and evolution of vertebrate skin coloration."}
