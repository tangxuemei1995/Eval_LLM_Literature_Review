{"Abstract": "Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) plays a crucial role in the rapid adaptation of organisms to environmental changes, bridging the gap between immediate phenotypic responses and long-term genetic evolution. This study explores the timescales of TEI, focusing on how epigenetic marks are transmitted across generations and influence adaptive traits. By integrating data from diverse model organisms, we demonstrate that TEI can operate over multiple timescales, from immediate responses to environmental stressors to more stable, heritable changes that persist for several generations. Our findings highlight the dynamic nature of TEI and its significance in shaping the adaptive potential of populations. This research underscores the importance of considering both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in understanding the processes of adaptation and evolutionary change."}
