{"Abstract": "The field of tissue biology is on the cusp of a paradigm shift, driven by the need to understand the complex interplay between cell types and their organizational structures. Recent advances in single-cell genomics and imaging technologies have revealed that tissues are composed of dynamic, self-organizing modules rather than static, homogeneous units. These modules, characterized by distinct cell categories and relations, exhibit emergent properties that are not predictable from the properties of individual cells. This review explores the evolving concept of tissue organization, emphasizing the role of evolutionary processes in shaping cell interactions and the potential for self-organization in maintaining tissue homeostasis. By integrating these insights, we propose a new framework for understanding tissue biology that could lead to novel therapeutic strategies and a deeper appreciation of the fundamental principles governing multicellular life."}
