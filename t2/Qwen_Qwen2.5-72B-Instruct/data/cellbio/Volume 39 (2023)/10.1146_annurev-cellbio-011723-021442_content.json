{"Abstract": "The endometrium undergoes cyclic regeneration and remodeling, essential for menstruation and pregnancy. However, disruptions in this process can lead to fibrosis and intrauterine adhesions, as seen in Asherman syndrome. Recent studies have highlighted the role of endometrial stem cells in tissue repair and regeneration. These cells, located in the basalis layer, are crucial for the rapid regeneration of the endometrium following menstruation and parturition. However, their dysregulation can contribute to fibrotic changes, leading to impaired fertility and reproductive health. This review explores the molecular mechanisms underlying endometrial regeneration and fibrosis, emphasizing the potential therapeutic targets for conditions such as Asherman syndrome. Understanding these mechanisms is vital for developing strategies to prevent and treat intrauterine adhesions and improve reproductive outcomes."}
