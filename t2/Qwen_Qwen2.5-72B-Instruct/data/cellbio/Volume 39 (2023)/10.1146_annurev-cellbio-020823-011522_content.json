{"Abstract": "Morphogens play a crucial role in the control of tissue development by establishing concentration gradients that guide cell differentiation and patterning within the embryo. This review examines the mechanisms by which morphogens, through their diffusion and interaction with gene regulatory networks, orchestrate the precise spatial and temporal organization of tissues. Recent studies highlight the importance of feedback loops and the integration of multiple signaling pathways in maintaining robust morphogen gradients. Understanding these processes is essential for elucidating the fundamental principles of embryonic development and has implications for regenerative medicine and the treatment of developmental disorders."}
