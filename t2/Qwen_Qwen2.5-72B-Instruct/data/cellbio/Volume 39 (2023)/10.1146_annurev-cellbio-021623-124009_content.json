{"Abstract": "tRNA dysregulation has emerged as a critical factor in the pathogenesis of both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. This review highlights the roles of tRNA processing, modification, and splicing in maintaining neuronal function and the consequences of their disruption. Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, which charge tRNAs with their cognate amino acids, and enzymes like angiogenin, which are involved in tRNA splicing, are key players in this process. Dysfunctions in these enzymes can lead to the accumulation of aberrant tRNAs, triggering the integrated stress response and contributing to cellular dysfunction. Recent studies have linked specific tRNA modifications to altered protein synthesis and neuronal viability, underscoring the importance of tRNA homeostasis in neural health. This review synthesizes current knowledge on tRNA dysregulation and its implications for understanding and potentially treating neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders."}
