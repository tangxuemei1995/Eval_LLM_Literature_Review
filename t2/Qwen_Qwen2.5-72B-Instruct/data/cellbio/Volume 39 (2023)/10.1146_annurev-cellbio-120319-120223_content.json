{"Abstract": "The Toll signaling pathway, originally identified for its role in dorsoventral patterning in Drosophila, has undergone neofunctionalization in various insect lineages, expanding its role from immunity to embryonic patterning. This study investigates the evolution of Toll signaling in Tribolium, Nasonia, Oncopeltus, and Gryllus, as well as in non-insect hexapods. We find that while the core components of the pathway are conserved, the specific functions of Toll signaling in germ layer formation, particularly in mesoderm specification and serosa development, have diverged. Comparative analysis reveals that the pathway's role in serosal cuticle and blastodermal cuticle formation is more pronounced in these species compared to Drosophila. These findings provide insights into the evolutionary plasticity of signaling pathways and their impact on the diversification of embryonic patterning mechanisms in insects."}
