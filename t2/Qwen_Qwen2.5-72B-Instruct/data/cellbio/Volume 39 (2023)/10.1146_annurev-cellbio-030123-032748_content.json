{"Abstract": "Microtubules, dynamic polymers of α- and β-tubulin, play essential roles in cellular functions such as cell division, intracellular transport, and cell shape maintenance. The tubulin code, a concept that encompasses the diversity of tubulin isoforms and their posttranslational modifications (PTMs), adds a layer of complexity to microtubule function. PTMs such as detyrosination, tyrosination, acetylation, glutamylation, and glycylation modulate microtubule stability, dynamics, and interactions with microtubule-associated proteins. This review summarizes recent advances in understanding the tubulin code, highlighting the molecular mechanisms and functional consequences of these modifications. We discuss the implications of the tubulin code in health and disease, including its role in neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and developmental abnormalities. By elucidating the tubulin code, we aim to provide insights into potential therapeutic targets and strategies for modulating microtubule function in various pathological conditions."}
