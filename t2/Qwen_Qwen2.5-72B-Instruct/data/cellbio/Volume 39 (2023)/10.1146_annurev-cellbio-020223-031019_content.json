{"Abstract": "Tissue morphogenesis is a complex process that involves the dynamic interplay between cells and their extracellular matrix (ECM). This study explores the role of cell adhesion molecules, such as integrins and cadherins, in mediating the mechanical and biochemical interactions that drive tissue formation. We investigate how interfacial tension at cell-ECM interfaces influences cell shape, migration, and the assembly of the basement membrane. Using a combination of in vitro assays and computational modeling, we demonstrate that the balance between cell adhesion and interfacial tension is critical for the proper organization of tissues. Our findings highlight the importance of these interactions in developmental processes and provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for diseases characterized by disrupted tissue architecture."}
