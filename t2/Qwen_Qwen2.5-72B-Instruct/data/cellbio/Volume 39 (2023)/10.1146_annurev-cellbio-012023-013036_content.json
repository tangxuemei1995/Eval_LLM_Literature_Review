{"Abstract": "The development of the retina, a complex neural tissue, is a highly orchestrated process that begins with the formation of the optic cup and culminates in the establishment of a stratified structure with distinct layers of neurons. This study provides a comprehensive overview of retinal morphogenesis in fish, focusing on the dynamic changes in shape and growth that occur during early development. Using a combination of live imaging, genetic manipulation, and mathematical modeling, we elucidate the mechanisms underlying the transformation of the optic cup into a functional retina. Our findings reveal that the initial invagination of the optic vesicle is driven by coordinated cell shape changes and oriented cell divisions, which are essential for the proper formation of the optic cup. Subsequently, the growth and expansion of the retina are regulated by a balance of proliferation and differentiation, with specific signaling pathways playing critical roles in this process. Neuronal migration, a key step in the establishment of retinal layers, is guided by a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic cues, including the expression of adhesion molecules and the secretion of chemotactic factors. This study not only enhances our understanding of retinal development in fish but also provides insights into the conserved mechanisms that govern retinal morphogenesis across vertebrates."}
