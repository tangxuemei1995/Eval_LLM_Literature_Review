{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in single-molecule tracking (SMT) have revolutionized our understanding of transcription factor (TF) dynamics within living cells. This study employs SMT to investigate the spatiotemporal behavior of TFs at the single-molecule level, revealing intricate patterns of transcriptional bursting and gene regulation. By integrating SMT data with high-resolution imaging of chromatin dynamics, we uncover the role of genome organization in modulating TF activity. Our findings demonstrate that TFs exhibit heterogeneous binding kinetics, with transient interactions facilitating the search for target sites and stable binding promoting transcriptional activation. These insights provide a mechanistic framework for understanding how TFs navigate the complex chromatin landscape to regulate gene expression, highlighting the importance of dynamic interactions in the context of genome organization and chromatin structure."}
