{"Abstract": "Cis interactions, defined as interactions between membrane receptors and ligands on the same cell surface, play a crucial role in cellular signaling and regulation. Unlike trans interactions, which occur between molecules on adjacent cells, cis interactions can modulate receptor activity and influence cellular responses. This review summarizes recent findings on the mechanisms and functional implications of cis interactions, highlighting their involvement in various biological processes such as immune responses, developmental pathways, and disease states. Studies using advanced imaging techniques and biochemical assays have revealed that cis interactions can either enhance or inhibit receptor signaling, depending on the specific receptor-ligand pair and cellular context. Understanding these interactions is essential for developing targeted therapies and manipulating cellular signaling pathways."}
