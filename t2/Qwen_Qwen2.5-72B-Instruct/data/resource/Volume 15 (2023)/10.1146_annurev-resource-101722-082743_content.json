{"Abstract": "This study integrates insights from behavioral economics and neuroeconomics to explore the underlying mechanisms of individual decision-making regarding environmental values and the management of common pool resources. By employing a combination of experimental economic games and neuroimaging techniques, we investigate how cognitive biases, social preferences, and neural activity influence decisions that impact environmental sustainability. Our findings reveal that individuals exhibit a tendency to overexploit resources due to present-biased preferences and limited empathy for future generations. However, social norms and information interventions can significantly enhance cooperative behavior. Neuroimaging data indicate that the prefrontal cortex plays a crucial role in mediating these decisions, with increased activation associated with more sustainable choices. These results have important implications for the design of policies aimed at promoting environmental stewardship and sustainable resource management."}
