{"Abstract": "This paper explores the pivotal role of mathematical programming in addressing the multifaceted challenges of climate change within the realms of agriculture and natural resource management. By integrating advanced optimization techniques, the study demonstrates how mathematical models can effectively simulate and optimize decision-making processes under varying climatic conditions. Key applications include the development of resilient agricultural systems, efficient water resource allocation, and sustainable land use practices. The analysis highlights the potential of these models in both adaptation and mitigation strategies, offering policymakers and practitioners robust tools to enhance environmental sustainability and economic viability. Case studies from diverse geographical regions underscore the versatility and effectiveness of mathematical programming in tackling the complex interactions between climate, ecosystems, and human activities."}
