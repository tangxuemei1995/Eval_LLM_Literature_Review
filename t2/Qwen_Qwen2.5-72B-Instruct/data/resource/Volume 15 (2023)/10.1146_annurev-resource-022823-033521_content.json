{"Abstract": "This study examines the heterogeneous impacts of obesity on life expectancy across developed and developing countries, integrating data from global health surveys and mortality statistics. Obesity, a significant public health issue, is associated with increased mortality and reduced life expectancy. However, the magnitude of this impact varies significantly between different economic contexts. In developed countries, where obesity rates are generally higher, the adverse effects on life expectancy are more pronounced due to the prevalence of obesity-related conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Conversely, in developing countries, the relationship is more complex, influenced by factors such as undernutrition, infectious diseases, and limited healthcare access. The analysis reveals that while obesity reduces life expectancy in both contexts, the reduction is more severe in developed countries. Policy implications suggest a need for tailored interventions that address the specific health challenges and resource constraints of each region to mitigate the impact of obesity on life expectancy."}
