{"Abstract": "This study examines the inferential and behavioral implications of measurement error in agricultural data, focusing on biases arising from misperception and misreporting. Using a comprehensive dataset, we assess how such errors affect statistical inference and decision-making in agricultural practices. Our findings reveal significant discrepancies between reported and actual data, leading to biased estimates and suboptimal policy recommendations. We propose methods to correct for these biases, enhancing the reliability of agricultural data and improving the accuracy of policy interventions."}
