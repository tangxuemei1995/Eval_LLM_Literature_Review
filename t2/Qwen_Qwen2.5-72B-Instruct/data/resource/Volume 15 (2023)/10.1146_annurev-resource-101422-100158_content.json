{"Abstract": "This study examines the impact of social protection programs, particularly cash transfers, on rural transformation in Africa. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, including impact evaluation and case studies, the research assesses how these interventions influence income, agricultural production, and broader socio-economic outcomes. Findings indicate that cash transfers significantly enhance household income and agricultural productivity, contributing to rural economic diversification. However, the effectiveness of these programs varies across regions, influenced by factors such as implementation quality, local governance, and access to markets. The study highlights the importance of integrating social protection with agricultural extension services and market access initiatives to maximize long-term benefits. Policy recommendations emphasize the need for tailored, context-specific strategies to support sustainable rural transformation in Africa."}
