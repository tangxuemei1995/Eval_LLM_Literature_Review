{"Abstract": "This study examines the differences in R&D lag models between the agricultural and industrial sectors, focusing on the dynamics of knowledge stocks and flows. By analyzing the adoption and diffusion processes of technological innovations, we identify key factors that contribute to the slower pace of technological change in agriculture compared to industry. The research employs a comprehensive dataset spanning several decades and utilizes econometric models to quantify the impact of R&D investments on productivity gains. Findings suggest that the agricultural sector faces unique challenges, such as longer development cycles and greater dependency on environmental conditions, which contribute to extended R&D lags. Policy implications are discussed, emphasizing the need for targeted support to accelerate innovation and adoption in agriculture."}
