{"Abstract": "This study examines the economic implications of crop residue management practices, focusing on the challenges and opportunities for smallholder farmers. The analysis integrates data on crop biomass utilization, residue burning, and the adoption of alternative technologies. Key findings highlight the significant environmental effects of residue burning, including contributions to climate change and local air pollution. The study also assesses the economic benefits and barriers to adopting sustainable residue management practices, such as composting and bioenergy production. Results indicate that while initial costs and lack of awareness pose significant hurdles, policy support and technological innovations can enhance the adoption of these practices, leading to improved environmental outcomes and economic benefits for smallholder farmers."}
