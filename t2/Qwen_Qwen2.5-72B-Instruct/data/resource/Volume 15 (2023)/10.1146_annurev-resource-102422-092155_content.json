{"Abstract": "Sir Partha Dasgupta, a distinguished economist, has made seminal contributions to the fields of environmental and development economics. His work emphasizes the interplay between economic growth, resource depletion, and environmental sustainability. In this autobiographical account, Dasgupta reflects on his academic journey, highlighting key research milestones and the evolution of his thinking on critical issues such as the measurement of inclusive wealth, the role of natural capital in economic development, and the ethical dimensions of intergenerational equity. Dasguptaâ€™s insights into the complexities of sustainable development have influenced policy and academic discourse globally. He advocates for a holistic approach that integrates ecological, social, and economic factors to address the pressing challenges of our time, including climate change and biodiversity loss. This reflection not only provides a personal perspective on his contributions but also offers valuable lessons for future generations of economists and policymakers."}
