{"Abstract": "This study investigates the impact of temperature on labor and mental productivity, considering adaptation and early-life exposure. Using a comprehensive dataset, we find that extreme temperatures, both hot and cold, significantly reduce productivity, with greater adverse effects in regions with less adaptive capacity. Early-life exposure to temperature extremes also influences long-term productivity. Distributional effects highlight disparities, with vulnerable populations experiencing more pronounced impacts. Policy interventions aimed at adaptation and resilience can mitigate these effects."}
