{"Abstract": "This paper explores the role of agroecology in fostering a sustainable agriculture and food system, emphasizing the transition from local solutions to large-scale adoption. Agroecology, which integrates ecological principles with agricultural practices, offers a promising framework for addressing the multifaceted challenges of food security, environmental sustainability, and social equity. The study examines multiactor approaches, involving farmers, researchers, policymakers, and consumers, to facilitate the adoption of agroecological practices across multiple scales. It highlights the importance of agricultural and food policies in supporting this transformation, particularly in the context of emerging technologies that can enhance the efficiency and resilience of agroecological systems. Case studies from diverse regions illustrate the potential of agroecology to improve soil health, biodiversity, and farm productivity while reducing environmental impacts. The paper concludes with recommendations for policy interventions and research priorities to accelerate the widespread implementation of agroecological practices, contributing to a more sustainable and equitable food system globally."}
