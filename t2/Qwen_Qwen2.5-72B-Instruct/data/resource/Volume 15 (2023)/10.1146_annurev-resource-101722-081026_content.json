{"Abstract": "This review synthesizes recent advances in causal inference methodologies applied to the study of air pollution and health outcomes. By leveraging natural experiments and integrating epidemiological data with environmental science, this research enhances our understanding of the causal relationships between specific pollutants and health impacts. Key findings include the identification of critical exposure thresholds and the differential effects across vulnerable populations. The integration of these methodologies supports more robust policy recommendations, particularly in the development of integrated science assessments. This work underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in addressing complex environmental health issues."}
