{"Abstract": "This review synthesizes current knowledge on food losses within agrifood systems, focusing on the measurement, determinants, and interventions to mitigate these losses. Food loss, distinct from food waste, occurs primarily in the early stages of the value chain, from production to processing. The review highlights the significant variability in loss rates across different commodities and regions, influenced by factors such as climate, infrastructure, and market access. Key determinants include post-harvest handling practices, storage conditions, and transportation efficiency. The paper also discusses the impact of food losses on food security and economic outcomes, emphasizing the need for context-specific interventions. Successful strategies include improved storage technologies, better market linkages, and policy support. However, challenges remain in accurately measuring and monitoring losses, particularly in developing countries. This review underscores the importance of a systems approach to address food losses, integrating multiple stakeholders and leveraging technological advancements to enhance the resilience and sustainability of agrifood systems."}
