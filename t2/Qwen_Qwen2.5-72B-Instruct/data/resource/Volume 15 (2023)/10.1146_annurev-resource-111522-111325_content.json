{"Abstract": "The implementation of sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) taxes has gained momentum as a public health strategy to combat obesity and chronic noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). This review evaluates the effectiveness of SSB taxes in achieving their primary policy goals, including reducing consumption, generating revenue for health initiatives, and improving dietary habits. A comprehensive analysis of recent studies from multiple jurisdictions reveals mixed outcomes. While some regions have reported significant reductions in SSB consumption and increases in healthier beverage choices, others have seen limited impact, possibly due to differences in tax rates, enforcement, and consumer behavior. The review also highlights the importance of complementary policies, such as nutrition education and restrictions on marketing to children, to enhance the overall effectiveness of SSB taxes. Future research should focus on long-term health outcomes and the potential for tailored interventions to address disparities in SSB consumption among different socioeconomic groups. The findings suggest that while SSB taxes are a promising tool, a multifaceted approach is necessary to achieve sustained improvements in public health."}
