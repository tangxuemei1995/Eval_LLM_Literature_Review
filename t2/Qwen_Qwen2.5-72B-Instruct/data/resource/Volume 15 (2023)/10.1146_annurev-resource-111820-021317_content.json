{"Abstract": "This study examines the economic implications of nutrient pollution from agricultural activities, focusing on the issues of fertilizer overapplication and nonpoint-source pollution. Agricultural runoff, laden with excess nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, contributes significantly to water quality degradation, leading to environmental externalities such as eutrophication and hypoxia. The economic analysis reveals that the costs of these externalities, including decreased property values, increased water treatment expenses, and loss of recreational and ecological services, are often not borne by the agricultural producers but are instead passed on to society. The paper explores various policy interventions, such as subsidies for precision agriculture, nutrient trading schemes, and regulatory measures, to internalize these externalities and promote more sustainable farming practices. Empirical evidence from case studies in the United States, Europe, and Asia suggests that a combination of economic incentives and regulatory frameworks can effectively reduce nutrient pollution while maintaining agricultural productivity. The findings highlight the need for a multifaceted approach to address the complex economic and environmental challenges posed by agricultural nutrient pollution."}
