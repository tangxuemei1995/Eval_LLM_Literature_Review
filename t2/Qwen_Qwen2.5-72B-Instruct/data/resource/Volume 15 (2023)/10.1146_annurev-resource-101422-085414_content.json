{"Abstract": "This study examines the economic dimensions of ecosystem restoration, focusing on the interplay between biodiversity, environmental policies, and socioeconomic impacts. By synthesizing data from global case studies, the research highlights the significant economic benefits of restoring degraded ecosystems, including enhanced ecosystem services, increased agricultural productivity, and improved human well-being. The analysis also underscores the critical role of policy frameworks in facilitating restoration efforts, particularly through incentives for sustainable land use and community engagement. However, the study identifies challenges such as high initial costs and the need for long-term commitment, which can be mitigated through strategic partnerships and innovative financing mechanisms. The findings provide a robust foundation for policymakers and practitioners to develop effective strategies that balance ecological and economic objectives, ultimately contributing to sustainable development."}
