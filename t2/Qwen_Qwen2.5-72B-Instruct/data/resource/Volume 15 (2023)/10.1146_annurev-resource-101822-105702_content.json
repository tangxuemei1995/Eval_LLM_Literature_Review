{"Abstract": "This review examines the multifaceted impacts of climate change-related risks on the financial sector, focusing on banking, insurance, and financial markets. Climate change exacerbates the frequency and severity of natural disasters, posing significant financial and operational challenges. Banks face increased credit risk due to the potential default of borrowers in vulnerable regions, while insurance companies encounter higher claims and underwriting losses. Financial markets are also affected, with climate-related events leading to increased volatility and the potential for systemic risk. The review highlights the need for robust risk management strategies, including stress testing and scenario analysis, to assess and mitigate these risks. Regulatory frameworks are evolving to incorporate climate risk considerations, emphasizing the importance of transparency and disclosure. The financial sector's response to climate change is critical not only for its own stability but also for the broader economy's resilience. This paper synthesizes existing literature to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research and identifies key areas for future investigation."}
