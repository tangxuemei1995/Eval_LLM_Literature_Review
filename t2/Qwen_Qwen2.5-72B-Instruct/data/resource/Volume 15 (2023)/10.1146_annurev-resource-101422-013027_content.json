{"Abstract": "Food fraud, encompassing practices such as adulteration and mislabeling, exploits the asymmetric information inherent in credence goods, leading to significant economic and health consequences. This paper examines the root causes of food fraud, including the challenges of costly and imperfect enforcement, and explores the effectiveness of various deterrence strategies, such as certification programs and regulatory frameworks. By addressing these issues, the study aims to provide actionable insights for policymakers and industry stakeholders to enhance food safety and consumer trust."}
