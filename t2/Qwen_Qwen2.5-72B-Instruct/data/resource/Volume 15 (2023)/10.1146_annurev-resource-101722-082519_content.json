{"Abstract": "This paper examines the evolving standards of evidence in the impact assessment of international agricultural research, emphasizing the need for rigorous methodologies to establish causality and scale. The traditional approaches to measuring the impact of agricultural interventions have often been criticized for their lack of robustness and generalizability. This study reviews recent advancements in impact assessment techniques, including randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental designs, and mixed-methods approaches, which offer more reliable and valid measures of impact. The paper also discusses the challenges of scaling up successful interventions and the importance of context-specific evaluations. By adopting these new standards, the agricultural research community can enhance the credibility and utility of impact assessments, ultimately contributing to more effective policies and practices in agricultural development."}
