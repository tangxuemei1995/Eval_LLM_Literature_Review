{"Abstract": "This study examines the measurement of food insecurity, economic modeling of its determinants, and the effectiveness of major food assistance programs in the United States. Utilizing data from the Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement, we assess the prevalence and severity of food insecurity across different demographic groups. Econometric models are employed to identify key socioeconomic factors contributing to food insecurity, including income, employment status, and household composition. The impact of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), School Breakfast Program (SBP), National School Lunch Program (NSLP), and the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program on food and nutrition security is evaluated through a combination of quasi-experimental designs and longitudinal analysis. Results indicate that while these programs significantly reduce food insecurity, particularly among vulnerable populations, there remains a substantial unmet need. Policy recommendations include expanding eligibility criteria, increasing benefit levels, and enhancing program coordination to better address the multifaceted nature of food insecurity. This research underscores the critical role of comprehensive food assistance in promoting health and well-being, particularly in economically disadvantaged communities."}
