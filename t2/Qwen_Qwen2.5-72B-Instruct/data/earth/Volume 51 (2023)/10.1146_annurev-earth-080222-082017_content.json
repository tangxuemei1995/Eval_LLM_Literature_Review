{"Abstract": "This study employs a systems approach to elucidate the profound impact of plants on Earth's environment during the late Paleozoic era, a period marked by significant climatic and ecological transformations. By integrating plant functional traits and strategies with advanced ecosystem and Earth system modeling, we explore the mechanisms through which early land plants altered atmospheric composition, soil formation, and global climate. Our analysis reveals that the evolution of key plant traits, such as vascular systems and root structures, played a crucial role in enhancing carbon sequestration and oxygen production, thereby driving the transition from a greenhouse to an icehouse climate. Additionally, the expansion of terrestrial vegetation influenced hydrological cycles and nutrient cycling, leading to the development of more complex and diverse ecosystems. The vegetation-climate interactions during this period are reconstructed using a coupled model that simulates the feedbacks between plant growth, atmospheric CO2 levels, and climate patterns. Our findings highlight the critical role of plants in shaping Earth's environment and provide insights into the long-term consequences of vegetation dynamics on planetary systems. This research underscores the importance of considering plant functional strategies in understanding past and future environmental changes, offering a robust framework for predicting the impacts of contemporary vegetation shifts on global climate and ecosystems."}
