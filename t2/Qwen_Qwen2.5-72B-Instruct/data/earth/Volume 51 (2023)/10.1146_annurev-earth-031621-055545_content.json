{"Abstract": "Giant impacts play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of planetary bodies within protoplanetary disks. These high-energy collisions between large planetary embryos and planetesimals are pivotal in shaping the final composition, size, and orbital characteristics of planets. Recent simulations and observational data have provided new insights into the mechanisms and consequences of these events. The angular momentum transfer during giant impacts can lead to the formation of moons, as exemplified by the Earth-Moon system, where a Mars-sized body is hypothesized to have collided with the proto-Earth. Additionally, the redistribution of mass and energy during these impacts can significantly alter the internal structure and thermal evolution of the impacted bodies, influencing their long-term geophysical and geochemical processes. This review synthesizes the current understanding of giant impacts, highlighting their role in the accretion of terrestrial planets and the delivery of volatiles, which are essential for the development of habitable environments. The implications of giant impacts extend beyond our Solar System, as similar processes are likely to occur in exoplanetary systems, providing a framework for understanding the diversity of planetary architectures observed in the universe."}
