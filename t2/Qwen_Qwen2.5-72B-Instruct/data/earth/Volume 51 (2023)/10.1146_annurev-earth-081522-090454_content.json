{"Abstract": "The Neogene history of the Amazonian flora is a complex interplay of geological, climatic, and biotic factors that have shaped the region's biodiversity over millions of years. This study integrates geological, palynological, and molecular phylogenetic data to provide a comprehensive perspective on the evolution and distribution of Amazonian plant species. Geological evidence indicates that the uplift of the Andes during the Neogene played a crucial role in the formation of the Amazon Basin, creating a diverse array of habitats and influencing the region's climate. Palynological records from sediment cores reveal significant changes in vegetation composition, reflecting shifts in climate and the establishment of new plant communities. For instance, the mid-Miocene climatic optimum led to the expansion of tropical forests, while the Pliocene cooling favored the spread of savanna-like ecosystems. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of key plant families, such as Fabaceae and Melastomataceae, provide insights into the timing and patterns of diversification. These analyses suggest that many Amazonian lineages underwent rapid radiation during the late Miocene and Pliocene, coinciding with the Andean orogeny and associated environmental changes. The integration of these data sources highlights the importance of both abiotic and biotic factors in shaping the Amazonian flora, and underscores the resilience and adaptability of plant species in response to climate change. This study also has implications for understanding the paleobiogeography of the region, as it reveals the dynamic nature of Amazonian ecosystems over geological timescales."}
