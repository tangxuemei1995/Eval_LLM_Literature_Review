{"Abstract": "This study investigates the fracture energy and breakdown work during earthquakes, focusing on the dynamic weakening processes and their implications for the earthquake energy budget. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of seismic events, we explore the relationship between fracture energy, which is the energy required to create new fracture surfaces, and breakdown work, which encompasses the total energy dissipated during the rupture process. Our findings reveal that dynamic weakening mechanisms, such as flash heating and melt lubrication, play a critical role in reducing the effective friction on fault zones, thereby influencing the rupture dynamics and the overall energy budget of earthquakes. We also examine the spatial and temporal variations in fracture energy and breakdown work across different fault zone structures, highlighting the importance of fault zone heterogeneity in controlling the energy release during seismic events. The results provide new insights into the complex interplay between fault zone properties and the energetics of earthquake ruptures, with significant implications for earthquake hazard assessment and the development of more accurate predictive models."}
