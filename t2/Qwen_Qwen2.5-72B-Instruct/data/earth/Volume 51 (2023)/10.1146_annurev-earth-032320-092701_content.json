{"Abstract": "The Phanerozoic eon, spanning approximately 541 million years, has witnessed significant changes in the Earth's carbon cycle, driven by a complex interplay of biological, geological, and climatic processes. This study synthesizes recent advances in modeling techniques to explore the evolution of carbon sources and sinks over this vast timescale. By integrating data from geochemical proxies, paleoclimate reconstructions, and biogeochemical models, we provide a comprehensive overview of the key mechanisms that have shaped the carbon cycle. Our models suggest that the primary drivers of carbon cycle dynamics during the Phanerozoic include variations in volcanic outgassing, weathering rates, and the burial of organic carbon. Notably, the rise of land plants during the Devonian period significantly enhanced silicate weathering, leading to a drawdown of atmospheric CO2 and a cooling trend that persisted into the Carboniferous. This cooling was further amplified by the extensive burial of organic carbon in peat swamps, which later formed coal deposits. In contrast, the Mesozoic era saw a reversal of this trend, with increased volcanic activity and reduced weathering efficiency contributing to higher atmospheric CO2 levels and a warmer climate. The Cenozoic era, particularly the Neogene, experienced a gradual cooling, driven by the uplift of mountain ranges and the associated increase in weathering rates. Our models also highlight the importance of oceanic processes, such as the biological pump and the carbonate compensation depth, in regulating the marine carbon cycle. These findings underscore the dynamic nature of the carbon cycle over deep time and provide a framework for understanding the long-term feedbacks between the carbon cycle, climate, and Earth's biota. The implications of these models for future climate change scenarios are discussed, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach to carbon cycle research that integrates both short-term and long-term perspectives."}
