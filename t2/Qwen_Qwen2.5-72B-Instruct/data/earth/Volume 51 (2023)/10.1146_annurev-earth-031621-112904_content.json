{"Abstract": "This study investigates the petrogenesis and geodynamic significance of xenolithic eclogites found within kimberlite pipes, focusing on their role in elucidating the processes of continent evolution and deep geochemical cycles. Kimberlite-borne xenolithic eclogites are rare but crucial samples that provide direct evidence of the composition and evolution of the lithospheric mantle and the convecting mantle. These eclogites, which are typically derived from paleo-subduction zones, offer insights into the deep Earth's thermal and chemical structure. Through detailed petrological and geochemical analyses, including trace element and isotopic compositions, we demonstrate that the eclogites exhibit a range of compositions that reflect their origin in subducted oceanic crust and their subsequent metamorphism and exhumation. The data suggest that these eclogites were entrained in the kimberlite magma during its ascent through the lithosphere, preserving a record of the geodynamic processes that have shaped the Earth's mantle over geological time. Our findings highlight the importance of kimberlite-borne xenolithic eclogites in understanding the long-term evolution of the lithospheric mantle and the convecting mantle, and their implications for the deep geochemical cycles that influence the Earth's surface environment."}
