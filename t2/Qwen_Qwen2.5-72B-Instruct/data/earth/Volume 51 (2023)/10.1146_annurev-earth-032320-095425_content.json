{"Abstract": "The Phanerozoic eon, spanning the last 541 million years, has witnessed significant fluctuations in atmospheric oxygen (O2) levels, which have profound implications for the evolution of life and the Earth's geochemical cycles. This study revisits the evolution of atmospheric O2 through the Phanerozoic, integrating recent advancements in geochemical proxies, isotopic records, and paleontological data. We analyze the interplay between the carbon cycle, volcanic outgassing, and biological processes, such as photosynthesis and respiration, to reconstruct O2 levels with higher temporal resolution. Our findings suggest that O2 concentrations have oscillated between 15% and 35% over the Phanerozoic, with notable peaks during the Carboniferous and Permian periods, coinciding with the proliferation of land plants and the diversification of terrestrial animals. These high O2 levels are hypothesized to have facilitated the evolution of large-bodied animals and complex ecosystems. Conversely, periods of low O2, such as the end-Permian mass extinction, are linked to widespread ocean anoxia and significant biodiversity loss. The study also highlights the role of tectonic activities and climate change in modulating O2 levels, underscoring the complex feedback mechanisms within the Earth system. This comprehensive review provides a refined understanding of the long-term dynamics of atmospheric O2 and its impact on the evolution of life on Earth."}
