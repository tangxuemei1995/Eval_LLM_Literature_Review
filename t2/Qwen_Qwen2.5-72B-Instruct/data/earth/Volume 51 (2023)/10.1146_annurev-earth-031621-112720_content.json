{"Abstract": "Elastic thermobarometry represents a novel approach to reconstructing the pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions of metamorphic rocks. This method leverages the elastic and plastic deformation of mineral inclusions within host minerals, observable through advanced techniques such as Raman spectroscopy. By analyzing the strain-induced shifts in Raman spectra, researchers can infer the P-T history of metamorphic assemblages with high precision. This study explores the application of elastic thermobarometry in various metamorphic settings, comparing its results with traditional methods. The findings highlight the potential of this technique to provide more accurate and detailed insights into the conditions of metamorphism, particularly in complex geological environments where conventional approaches may be limited. The integration of elastic, viscous, and plastic deformation data enhances the robustness of P-T reconstructions, offering a comprehensive understanding of metamorphic processes."}
