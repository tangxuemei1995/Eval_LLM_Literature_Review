{"Abstract": "The Lomagundi-Jatuli Carbon Isotope Excursion (LJCE) is a prominent feature in the geological record of the Paleoproterozoic era, characterized by a significant and prolonged positive Î´13C excursion. This excursion, occurring approximately 2.22 to 2.06 billion years ago, is widely regarded as one of the most extreme carbon isotope anomalies in Earth's history. The LJCE is closely associated with the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), a period marked by a substantial increase in atmospheric oxygen levels. This study aims to deconstruct the LJCE by integrating geochemical, isotopic, and sedimentological data from multiple Precambrian basins. We explore the potential drivers of this excursion, including changes in the global carbon cycle, the role of microbial metabolism, and the impact of tectonic and volcanic activities. Our findings suggest that the LJCE may have been triggered by a combination of enhanced organic carbon burial and the oxidation of methane, leading to a significant shift in the carbon isotope composition of marine and terrestrial reservoirs. This research provides new insights into the complex interplay between biogeochemical processes and the evolution of Earth's atmosphere during the Paleoproterozoic."}
