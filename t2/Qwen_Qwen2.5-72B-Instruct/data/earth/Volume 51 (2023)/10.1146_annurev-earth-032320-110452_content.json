{"Abstract": "The Gangdese Batholith, located in the southern part of the Tibetan Plateau, provides a unique window into the processes of continental crustal growth in a collision zone. This study integrates geochemical, isotopic, and geochronological data to elucidate the magmatic and tectonic evolution of the batholith. The batholith is characterized by a diverse suite of granitoids, ranging from tonalites to granites, which were emplaced during the Cenozoic era. Geochemical analyses reveal that the magmas were derived from both mantle and crustal sources, with significant contributions from the partial melting of the lower continental crust. Isotopic signatures indicate a complex interplay between magmatic arc processes and crustal assimilation, suggesting that the growth of the Gangdese Batholith was influenced by the subduction of the Indian plate beneath the Eurasian plate. The stratification of the crust, as evidenced by variations in magma composition and age, reflects multiple phases of magmatic activity and crustal thickening. This study highlights the importance of magmatic arc processes in the formation and evolution of continental crust, particularly in collisional settings such as the Tibetan Plateau. The findings contribute to a broader understanding of crustal growth mechanisms and the geological history of one of the most significant orogenic belts on Earth."}
