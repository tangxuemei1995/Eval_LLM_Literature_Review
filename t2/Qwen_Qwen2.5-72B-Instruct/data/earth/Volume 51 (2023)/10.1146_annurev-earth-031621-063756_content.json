{"Abstract": "The ductile deformation of the lithospheric mantle is a critical process in the dynamics of plate tectonics and the evolution of the Earth's crust. This study investigates the mechanisms of ductile flow in the mantle, focusing on the role of olivine, the predominant mineral in the upper mantle. Through a combination of experimental deformation studies and natural observations, we explore the conditions under which olivine deforms plastically, including temperature, pressure, and strain rate. Our findings indicate that dislocation creep and grain boundary sliding are the primary mechanisms responsible for ductile deformation at depths where temperatures exceed 800Â°C and pressures are greater than 1 GPa. These mechanisms facilitate the accommodation of large-scale tectonic movements, such as subduction and continental collision. Additionally, the presence of water and other volatiles is shown to significantly enhance the ductility of olivine, reducing the activation energy for plastic deformation. This research provides insights into the rheological behavior of the lithospheric mantle and its implications for the mechanical strength of tectonic plates. The results are crucial for understanding the long-term deformation of the Earth's lithosphere and the distribution of seismic activity in tectonically active regions."}
