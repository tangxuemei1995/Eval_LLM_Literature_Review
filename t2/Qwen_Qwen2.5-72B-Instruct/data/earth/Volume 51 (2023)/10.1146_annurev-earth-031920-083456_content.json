{"Abstract": "This study investigates the hydrological consequences of solar geoengineering, a form of climate intervention aimed at reducing the impacts of climate change by modifying solar radiation. Utilizing a combination of climate models and historical data, we analyze the potential effects of solar radiation modification (SRM) on the hydrologic cycle, focusing on changes in precipitation patterns and water availability. Our findings suggest that while SRM can effectively reduce global mean temperatures, it may lead to significant alterations in regional hydrological processes. Specifically, we observe a decrease in precipitation in certain tropical and subtropical regions, which could exacerbate water scarcity issues. Conversely, some mid-latitude regions may experience increased precipitation, potentially leading to flooding and other hydrological extremes. The study also highlights the importance of considering the interactions between SRM and other climate change mitigation strategies to avoid unintended consequences. These results underscore the need for a comprehensive assessment of the hydrological impacts of solar geoengineering before its implementation, to ensure that it does not inadvertently worsen existing climate-related challenges."}
