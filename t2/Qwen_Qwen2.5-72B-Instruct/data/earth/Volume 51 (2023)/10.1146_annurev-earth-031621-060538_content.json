{"Abstract": "The chronology of Moon formation, a pivotal event in the early history of the Solar System, has been a subject of intense scrutiny and debate. Recent advancements in isotopic dating techniques and the refinement of numerical models have provided new insights into the timing and processes involved in the Moon's formation. The prevailing theory, the giant impact hypothesis, posits that the Moon was formed from the debris ejected by a collision between a Mars-sized body and the proto-Earth. This event is thought to have occurred approximately 4.5 billion years ago, but the precise timing and duration of subsequent processes, such as the solidification of the lunar magma ocean, remain uncertain. Recent studies have utilized high-precision isotopic analyses of lunar samples to constrain the ages of key events, including the crystallization of the lunar magma ocean and the formation of the Moon's crust. These data suggest that the lunar magma ocean may have taken longer to solidify than previously estimated, with some models indicating a protracted cooling period of up to 200 million years. Additionally, the integration of these isotopic data with dynamical models of the early Earth-Moon system has led to a more nuanced understanding of the Moon's early thermal and chemical evolution. This evolving chronology not only refines our understanding of the Moon's formation but also has implications for the broader context of planetary formation and the early Solar System."}
