{"Abstract": "Mimas, one of Saturn's innermost moons, has long been considered a frozen fragment with little geological activity. However, recent observations and theoretical models suggest a more complex and dynamic history. This study integrates data from the Cassini mission with advanced rotational dynamics simulations to explore the potential for a subsurface ocean and the implications for Mimas' formation and evolution. We analyze Mimas' tectonic features, such as the prominent Herschel crater, and their alignment with rotational poles, indicating possible past or present internal heat sources. The moon's libration and tidal heating are evaluated to assess the feasibility of maintaining a subsurface ocean. Our findings suggest that Mimas may have experienced a more active past, with tectonic activity driven by tidal forces and possibly a transient subsurface ocean. This challenges the traditional view of Mimas as a static, cold body and opens new avenues for understanding the formation and evolution of small icy satellites in the outer Solar System. The implications extend to the broader context of ocean worlds and the potential for habitable environments in unexpected locations."}
