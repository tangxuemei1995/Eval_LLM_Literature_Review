{"Abstract": "The field of carbonate clumped isotope thermometry has emerged as a powerful tool for reconstructing paleotemperatures and understanding the geochemical processes in Earth's history. This review synthesizes recent advancements in the methodology and application of clumped isotope thermometry, focusing on the measurement of the abundance of isotopologues containing multiple heavy isotopes (e.g., 13C18O16O) in carbonate minerals. The clumped isotope composition, denoted as Δ47, provides a direct measure of the temperature at which the carbonate formed, independent of the isotopic composition of the fluid. Recent studies have refined the calibration of Δ47 to temperature, improving the precision and accuracy of temperature reconstructions. Advances in mass spectrometry and sample preparation techniques have enabled the analysis of smaller and more diverse carbonate samples, expanding the applicability of this method to a wider range of geological settings. Additionally, the integration of clumped isotope data with other geochemical proxies, such as traditional stable isotopes (δ13C and δ18O), has provided new insights into the paleoenvironmental and biogeochemical processes that influence carbonate formation. This review also highlights the challenges and limitations of clumped isotope thermometry, including the effects of diagenesis and kinetic fractionation, and discusses future directions for research to address these issues. The continued development of clumped isotope thermometry promises to enhance our understanding of Earth's climate and environmental history."}
