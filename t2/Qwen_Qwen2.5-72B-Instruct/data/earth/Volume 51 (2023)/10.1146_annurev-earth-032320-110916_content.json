{"Abstract": "Iceberg calving, a critical process in the dynamics of ice sheets, significantly influences ice-sheet stability and contributes to global sea-level rise. This study synthesizes recent observations and modeling efforts to elucidate the mechanisms and regimes of iceberg calving in both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. We identify three primary calving regimes: rift-dominated, fracture-dominated, and melt-undercutting, each characterized by distinct environmental and structural conditions. Rift-dominated calving is prevalent in regions with extensive ice shelves, such as the Larsen C Ice Shelf in Antarctica, where large, tabular icebergs are calved through the propagation of pre-existing rifts. Fracture-dominated calving, observed in fast-flowing glaciers like Jakobshavn Isbr√¶ in Greenland, is driven by the rapid propagation of crevasses and fractures, often triggered by oceanic and atmospheric forcing. Melt-undercutting, a process more common in tidewater glaciers, involves the undercutting of glacier fronts by submarine melt, leading to the destabilization and eventual calving of icebergs. The transitions between these regimes are influenced by factors such as ocean temperature, sea ice cover, and the structural integrity of the ice. Our analysis highlights the importance of these transitions in modulating ice-sheet mass loss and suggests that future projections of sea-level rise must account for the dynamic interplay between calving regimes and environmental conditions. This study provides a framework for understanding the complex processes governing iceberg calving and their implications for ice-sheet stability and global sea-level rise."}
