{"Abstract": "Mars seismology has emerged as a critical field for understanding the planet's interior structure and geological activity. The InSight mission, equipped with the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS), has provided unprecedented data on marsquakes and impact events. Analysis of seismic waves has revealed that the Cerberus Fossae region is particularly active, with frequent seismic events suggesting ongoing tectonic and volcanic processes. The data also indicate a complex interior structure, with evidence of a thin crust, a partially molten mantle, and a large, liquid core. The seismic waves' travel times and amplitudes have been used to infer the presence of distinct layers within the Martian interior, contributing to our understanding of the planet's thermal and compositional evolution. Additionally, the detection of meteoroid impacts has provided insights into the current impact flux on Mars, which is crucial for assessing the planet's geological and environmental conditions. These findings not only enhance our knowledge of Mars but also offer valuable comparisons with Earth and other terrestrial planets, advancing our broader understanding of planetary formation and evolution."}
