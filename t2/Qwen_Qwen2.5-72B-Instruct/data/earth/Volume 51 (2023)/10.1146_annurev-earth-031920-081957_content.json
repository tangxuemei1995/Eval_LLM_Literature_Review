{"Abstract": "This study explores the rock-hosted biosphere, focusing on endolithic microorganisms that inhabit fractures and pores within the Earth's crust. These microorganisms, primarily chemolithoautotrophs, derive energy from inorganic compounds and play a crucial role in subsurface biogeochemical cycles. Through a combination of metagenomic analysis and in situ measurements, we characterized microbial communities in various crustal environments, revealing a diverse array of taxa adapted to extreme conditions. Our findings highlight the significance of fracture networks in facilitating microbial activity and nutrient transport, suggesting that these subsurface habitats may be more extensive and active than previously recognized. This research enhances our understanding of the deep biosphere and its potential implications for biogeochemical processes and the search for life in other planetary subsurfaces."}
