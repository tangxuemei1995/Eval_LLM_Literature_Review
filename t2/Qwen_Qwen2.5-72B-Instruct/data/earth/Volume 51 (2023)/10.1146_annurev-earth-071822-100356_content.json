{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate hydrological processes within landscapes, focusing on the roles of catchments and hillslopes in water cycling. Utilizing a combination of isotopic analysis and ecohydrological modeling, we investigate the unexpected dynamics that govern water movement and storage. Our findings reveal that the traditional understanding of runoff generation is insufficient to explain the observed variability in streamflow responses. Isotopic signatures indicate that deep subsurface flows and groundwater interactions play a more significant role than previously recognized, particularly in humid climates. This research underscores the importance of considering the full spectrum of hydrological pathways, from surface to subsurface, to accurately predict and manage water resources. The implications of these findings are far-reaching, suggesting that current models may need to be revised to incorporate these instructive surprises in hydrological functioning. This work contributes to a more comprehensive framework for understanding the complex interactions between water, soil, and vegetation in diverse landscapes."}
