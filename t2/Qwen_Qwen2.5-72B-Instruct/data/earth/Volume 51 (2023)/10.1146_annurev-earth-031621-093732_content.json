{"Abstract": "River deltas, critical interfaces between land and sea, are increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of sea-level rise, a consequence of global climate change. This study synthesizes recent findings from geomorphology and sedimentary geology to assess the resilience and adaptability of river deltas in the face of rising sea levels. Deltas are dynamic environments shaped by the interplay of fluvial, tidal, and wave processes, which are all influenced by the changing climate. As sea levels rise, the balance between sediment supply and accommodation space is disrupted, leading to increased erosion, saltwater intrusion, and the loss of coastal wetlands. The geomorphological response of deltas to these changes varies depending on factors such as the rate of sea-level rise, the magnitude of sediment input, and the degree of human intervention. For instance, deltas with high sediment loads, such as the Mississippi Delta, may have a greater capacity to keep pace with sea-level rise through natural accretion processes. However, deltas with reduced sediment supply, often due to upstream damming and river regulation, are more susceptible to submergence and land loss. This research highlights the importance of integrated coastal management strategies that consider both natural and anthropogenic factors to enhance the resilience of deltaic systems. By understanding the complex interactions between sea-level rise and deltaic geomorphology, this study provides a foundation for developing adaptive management practices that can mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on coastal communities and ecosystems."}
