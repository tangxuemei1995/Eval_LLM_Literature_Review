{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) techniques, particularly neural networks, in the field of earthquake seismology. By leveraging large datasets of seismic activity, ML algorithms are trained to detect, classify, and predict earthquakes with higher accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional methods. The research highlights the use of deep learning models for real-time earthquake detection, which can significantly enhance early warning systems. Additionally, the study investigates the potential of ML in identifying precursory patterns that may precede significant seismic events, contributing to more reliable risk assessment and mitigation strategies. The findings suggest that ML can provide valuable insights into the complex dynamics of seismic activity, thereby advancing our understanding and preparedness for earthquakes."}
