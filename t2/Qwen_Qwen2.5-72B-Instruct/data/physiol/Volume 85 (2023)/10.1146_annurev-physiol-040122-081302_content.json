{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in genetic and bionic technologies are revolutionizing our understanding and enhancement of proprioception. This review highlights the role of proprioceptive sensory neurons, including muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs, in conveying kinesthetic information to the dorsal column nuclei and somatosensory cortex. Emerging genetic approaches are refining the precision of these sensory pathways, while bionic strategies, such as neural machine interfaces, are enabling more intuitive control of prosthetic limbs. These innovations not only promise to alleviate motor impairments but also deepen our comprehension of the neural mechanisms underlying kinesthetic illusions. This convergence of genetic and bionic strategies heralds a new era in proprioceptive research and clinical applications."}
