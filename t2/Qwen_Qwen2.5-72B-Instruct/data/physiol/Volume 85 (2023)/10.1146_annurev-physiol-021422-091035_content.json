{"Abstract": "This study investigates the metabolic interactions between neurons and astrocytes in brain tissue, focusing on the roles of glucose, lactate, and oxygen in energy metabolism. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo techniques, we demonstrate that astrocytes play a crucial role in the regulation of neuronal energy supply through the glycolytic production of lactate, which is subsequently utilized by neurons for oxidative metabolism. Our findings reveal that under conditions of increased neuronal activity, astrocytes enhance glycolysis and lactate production, while neurons increase their uptake and oxidation of lactate. This metabolic coupling is supported by the strategic localization of mitochondria in astrocytes and the efficient transport of lactate via specific monocarboxylate transporters. The study highlights the importance of astrocyte-neuron metabolic interactions in maintaining brain function and suggests potential therapeutic targets for neurological disorders associated with metabolic dysregulation."}
