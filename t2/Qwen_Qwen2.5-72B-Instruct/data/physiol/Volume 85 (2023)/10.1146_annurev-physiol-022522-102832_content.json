{"Abstract": "Iron, an essential micronutrient, plays a critical role in various physiological processes, but its dysregulation is increasingly recognized as a contributing factor in the pathophysiology of diabetes. Elevated iron levels can lead to oxidative stress, which damages pancreatic Î²-cells and impairs insulin secretion. Additionally, iron overload can disrupt adipocyte function, promoting insulin resistance. The hormone hepcidin, which regulates iron homeostasis, is often dysregulated in diabetic patients, exacerbating iron accumulation. Genetic conditions such as hemochromatosis, characterized by excessive iron absorption, further highlight the link between iron and diabetes. This review explores the mechanisms by which iron dysregulation contributes to the development and progression of diabetes, emphasizing the potential therapeutic implications of targeting iron metabolism in diabetes management."}
