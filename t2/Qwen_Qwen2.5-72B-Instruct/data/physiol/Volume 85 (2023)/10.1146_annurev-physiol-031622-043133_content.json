{"Abstract": "Insulin clearance, a critical component of glucose homeostasis, varies significantly in health and disease. This review examines the mechanisms and implications of altered insulin clearance in conditions such as insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia. We explore how factors like age and ethnicity influence insulin action and clearance, highlighting the role of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) as a key contributor to impaired insulin metabolism. Understanding these dynamics is essential for developing targeted therapeutic strategies to manage metabolic disorders effectively."}
