{"Abstract": "Polycystin channel complexes, primarily composed of polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), play a critical role in the pathogenesis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). These proteins are integral components of the primary cilia, where they function as mechanosensors and calcium-permeable TRP channels. The gating mechanism of the polycystin channel complex is intricately regulated by mechanical stimuli and intracellular signaling pathways, influencing cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation. Mutations in the genes encoding these proteins lead to ciliopathies, including ADPKD, characterized by the formation of renal cysts and progressive kidney dysfunction. Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of polycystin channel complexes is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to mitigate the progression of ADPKD and related ciliopathies."}
