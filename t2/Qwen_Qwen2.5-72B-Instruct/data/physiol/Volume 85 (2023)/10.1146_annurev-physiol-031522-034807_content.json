{"Abstract": "Pericytes, specialized mural cells lining the microvasculature, play a crucial role in the regulation of blood flow in both the brain and heart. These cells are strategically positioned to modulate vascular tone and perfusion, thereby influencing tissue metabolism and function. In the brain, pericytes are integral to neurovascular coupling, where they respond to neuronal activity through electro-metabolic signaling pathways involving ion channels, particularly calcium and potassium channels. This dynamic interaction ensures that increased neuronal activity is matched by adequate blood supply. Similarly, in the heart, pericytes contribute to the fine-tuning of coronary blood flow, supporting cardiac function during varying metabolic demands. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of pericyte-derived signaling molecules and their impact on vascular reactivity and tissue homeostasis. Understanding the mechanisms by which pericytes control blood flow in these vital organs is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to address conditions such as ischemia, stroke, and heart disease."}
