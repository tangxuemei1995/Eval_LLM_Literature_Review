{"Abstract": "The microcirculation, a critical interface for oxygen and nutrient exchange, is regulated by a complex interplay of cellular and molecular mechanisms. Among these, redox signaling plays a pivotal role in modulating the function of endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and red blood cells. This review highlights the dynamic nature of redox signaling in the microcirculation, focusing on how changes in redox state influence calcium signaling and cellular function. Specifically, we discuss how oxidative stress can activate redox-sensitive pathways, leading to alterations in vascular tone, inflammation, and endothelial barrier integrity. The intercellular communication between endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and red blood cells is also examined, emphasizing the importance of redox balance in maintaining microvascular homeostasis. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies to mitigate microvascular dysfunction in various pathological conditions."}
