{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in molecular tools have revolutionized our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying breathing control. The preBötzinger complex (preBötC) and the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) have emerged as critical regions in the regulation of respiratory rhythms and responses to lung sensory inputs. Molecular techniques, such as optogenetics and chemogenetics, have enabled precise manipulation of specific neuronal populations, revealing the intricate roles of serotonin and the Hering-Breuer reflex in modulating breathing patterns. These studies have not only elucidated the complex interplay between central and peripheral respiratory control systems but also provided new insights into potential therapeutic targets for respiratory disorders. This review highlights the transformative impact of molecular tools on the field of respiratory neuroscience, emphasizing the dynamic and multifaceted nature of breathing control."}
