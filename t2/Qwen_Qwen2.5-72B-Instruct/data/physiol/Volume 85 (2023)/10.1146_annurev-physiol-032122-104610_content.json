{"Abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–plasma membrane (PM) junctions, also known as membrane contact sites (MCS), play a critical role in the regulation of Ca2+ signaling in excitable cells such as skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and neurons. These junctions facilitate the rapid and localized transfer of Ca2+ ions, which act as second messengers, from the ER to the cytosol in response to depolarization. The structural and functional organization of these MCSs involves specific ion channels and proteins that mediate Ca2+ release and influx. In skeletal and cardiac muscle, the ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and L-type Ca2+ channels are key components, while in smooth muscle and neurons, other channels such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) and transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are involved. This review highlights the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and regulation of ER–PM junctions and their significance in the precise control of Ca2+ signaling, which is essential for various cellular processes including contraction, secretion, and neurotransmission."}
