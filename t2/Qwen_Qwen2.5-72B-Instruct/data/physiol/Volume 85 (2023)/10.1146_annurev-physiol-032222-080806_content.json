{"Abstract": "Endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is a critical process in which endothelial cells lose their characteristic markers and acquire a mesenchymal phenotype. This phenomenon plays a pivotal role in both physiological and pathological conditions, including cardiovascular development, tissue repair, and the progression of diseases such as atherosclerosis and fibrosis. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying EndMT, highlighting the involvement of signaling pathways such as TGF-Î², Notch, and Wnt. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to modulate EndMT and improve outcomes in cardiovascular diseases. This review summarizes the current knowledge of EndMT, its regulatory factors, and its implications in health and disease, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets."}
