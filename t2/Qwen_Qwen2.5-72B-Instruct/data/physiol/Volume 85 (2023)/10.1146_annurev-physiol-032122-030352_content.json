{"Abstract": "Fatty acids (FAs) play crucial roles in cellular metabolism and signaling, with transport proteins such as CD36 and G-protein coupled receptors like FFAR1 and FFAR4 mediating their cellular uptake and signaling pathways. CD36 facilitates FA uptake into cells, particularly in adipose tissue and muscle, where it is essential for Î²-oxidation and energy production. FFAR1 and FFAR4, activated by medium and long-chain FAs, modulate insulin secretion, inflammation, and tissue repair. Caveolin, a scaffolding protein, interacts with CD36 to regulate FA uptake and signaling, influencing metabolic homeostasis. Dysregulation of these pathways is implicated in metabolic disorders, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. This review explores the mechanisms of FA transport and signaling, highlighting their physiological implications and potential therapeutic targets for metabolic diseases."}
