{"Abstract": "Cough, a protective reflex, is often a symptom of respiratory tract infections and can facilitate disease transmission. This review explores the intricate pathways linking infections and inflammation to cough, emphasizing the role of sensory neurons in mediating these responses. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted therapies to alleviate chronic cough and reduce the spread of infectious diseases."}
