{"Abstract": "Protein trafficking and quality control are essential processes for maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly in the kidney, where precise regulation is crucial for proper function. This review highlights the mechanisms governing the secretory pathway, focusing on the roles of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, and vesicle-mediated transport. Transmembrane emp24 domain-containing (TMED) proteins play a pivotal role in cargo selection and vesicle formation, ensuring the accurate delivery of proteins to their destinations, including the lysosome for degradation. Disruptions in these pathways have been implicated in various kidney diseases, underscoring the importance of understanding the molecular details of protein trafficking and quality control. Advances in proteomics and imaging techniques are providing new insights into the dynamic nature of these processes, offering potential therapeutic targets for kidney and other systemic disorders."}
