{"Abstract": "WNK signaling plays a crucial role in regulating ion transport through the modulation of NKCC and KCC cotransporters, which are essential for maintaining cellular ion homeostasis. This study investigates the intracellular ion control mechanisms of WNK signaling in the Malpighian tubule, a key organ for ion and water balance in insects. We demonstrate that WNK kinases activate SPAK, leading to the phosphorylation and regulation of NKCC and KCC, thereby fine-tuning ion transport. Additionally, we explore the link between WNK signaling and inflammasome activation, suggesting a potential role in inflammatory responses. These findings provide new insights into the complex regulatory network of ion transport and its implications in physiological and pathological conditions."}
