{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing have enabled the creation of comprehensive lung cell atlases, providing unprecedented insights into the cellular heterogeneity and molecular mechanisms underlying lung diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, asthma, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. These atlases reveal distinct cell types and states, their interactions, and the dynamic changes that occur in response to disease. By integrating these data with clinical outcomes, researchers can identify potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers, paving the way for more personalized and effective treatments. This review summarizes the key findings from lung cell atlases and discusses their implications for understanding and managing lung diseases."}
