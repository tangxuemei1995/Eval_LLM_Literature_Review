{"Abstract": "Myostatin, also known as growth differentiation factor-8 (GDF-8), is a member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily and functions as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth. This chalone, or growth-inhibiting factor, is synthesized as a latent precursor and requires activation through proteolytic cleavage. Myostatin signaling is mediated through activin type II receptors, leading to the activation of the Smad pathway, which ultimately inhibits myoblast proliferation and differentiation. Genetic studies in mice and natural mutations in cattle have demonstrated that loss of myostatin function results in significant muscle hypertrophy and increased muscle fiber size, highlighting its critical role in regulating tissue size. Understanding the mechanisms of myostatin action and its regulation holds potential for therapeutic interventions in muscle wasting diseases and enhancing muscle growth in livestock."}
