{"Abstract": "TRPV channels, a subfamily of transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels, play crucial roles in sensory transduction, particularly in pain and temperature sensation. Despite significant advances in understanding their structure and function, several controversies persist, including the mechanisms of channel activation, modulation, and the specific roles of individual TRPV subtypes in physiological and pathological conditions. This review highlights recent findings and ongoing debates in the field, emphasizing the need for more precise molecular and cellular studies to elucidate the complex interactions and signaling pathways involving TRPV channels. Future research should focus on developing novel pharmacological tools and genetic models to address these challenges and to uncover new therapeutic targets for pain management and other related disorders."}
