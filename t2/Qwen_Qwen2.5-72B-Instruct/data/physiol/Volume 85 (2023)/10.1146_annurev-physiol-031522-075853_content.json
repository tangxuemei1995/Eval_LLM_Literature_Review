{"Abstract": "The perception of salt taste, a critical component of gustation, is primarily mediated by the detection of sodium ions (Na+) in the oral cavity. This process involves specialized taste receptors, particularly the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which is expressed in the apical membrane of taste receptor cells. ENaC facilitates the influx of Na+ ions, triggering a cascade of cellular events that ultimately lead to the transmission of taste signals to the brain. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of ENaC, including its modulation by various factors such as pH and the presence of other ions. Additionally, the valence of sodium ions plays a crucial role in the intensity and quality of the perceived salt taste. Understanding these mechanisms not only enhances our knowledge of basic sensory biology but also has implications for dietary health and the development of salt substitutes."}
