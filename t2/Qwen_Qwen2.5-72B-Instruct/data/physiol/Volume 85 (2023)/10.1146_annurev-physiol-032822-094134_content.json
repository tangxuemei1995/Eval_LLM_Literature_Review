{"Abstract": "The mammalian liver exhibits remarkable heterogeneity and zonation, which are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and enabling efficient regeneration following acute and chronic injury. Recent studies have highlighted the dynamic nature of liver cells, revealing their plasticity and the intricate signaling pathways that govern their responses to damage. During homeostasis, distinct zones of the liver perform specialized metabolic functions, while in the context of injury, these zones can rapidly adapt and activate regeneration programs. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying liver zonation, the role of cellular heterogeneity in maintaining homeostasis, and the plasticity of liver cells during regeneration. Understanding these processes is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to enhance liver repair and prevent disease progression."}
