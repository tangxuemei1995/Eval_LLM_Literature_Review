{"Abstract": "The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the relationship between diet and human health, influencing metabolic processes and immune function. Recent studies have highlighted the microbiome's ability to modulate the production of metabolites that affect host physiology. Dietary components, such as fiber, polyphenols, and fats, are metabolized by gut microbes, producing a range of bioactive compounds that can have beneficial or detrimental effects on the host. For instance, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced from fiber fermentation have anti-inflammatory properties and can improve gut barrier function. Conversely, certain dietary fats can promote the growth of pathogenic bacteria, leading to dysbiosis and increased risk of metabolic disorders. This review synthesizes current knowledge on how diet shapes the gut microbiome and its metabolic output, emphasizing the potential for dietary interventions to promote health through microbiota-targeted strategies. Understanding these complex interactions is essential for developing personalized nutrition approaches that optimize gut microbial composition and function."}
