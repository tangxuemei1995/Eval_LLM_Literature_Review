{"Abstract": "The Human Cell Atlas (HCA) project, a global initiative to map every cell type in the human body, presents a unique case study for exploring the challenges and opportunities of open data sharing in the era of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This paper examines the ethical and legal frameworks that govern data protection and privacy in the context of large-scale genomic data. It highlights the HCAâ€™s strategies for balancing the principles of open science with the stringent requirements of the GDPR, including the implementation of robust data anonymization techniques, the establishment of data access committees, and the development of transparent data use agreements. The findings underscore the importance of proactive engagement with regulatory bodies and the scientific community to foster a culture of trust and collaboration, while ensuring compliance with data protection standards. These lessons are applicable to other large-scale biomedical research initiatives aiming to promote data sharing while safeguarding individual privacy."}
