{"Abstract": "Meiosis is a specialized cell division essential for sexual reproduction, and its proper execution is crucial for fertility. The synaptonemal complex (SC) plays a pivotal role in meiotic chromosome structure and function, facilitating homologous chromosome pairing, recombination, and segregation. Disruptions in SC formation or function can lead to meiotic defects, which are often associated with infertility. Conditions such as azoospermia in males and primary ovarian failure in females, as well as recurrent pregnancy loss, have been linked to aberrations in the meiotic process. Recent studies have identified specific genetic mutations and environmental factors that affect SC assembly and stability, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these fertility disorders. Understanding the intricate relationship between meiotic chromosome structure, the synaptonemal complex, and reproductive health is crucial for developing diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies to address infertility."}
