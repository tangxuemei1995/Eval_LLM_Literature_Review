{"Abstract": "The p-arms of human acrocentric chromosomes, which house the nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) and ribosomal genes, exhibit unique characteristics that distinguish them from other chromosomal regions. These regions are essential for ribosome biogenesis and are tightly regulated to maintain cellular homeostasis. Recent studies have revealed that the p-arms are enriched in heterochromatin and are hotspots for recombination, which can lead to Robertsonian translocations. These translocations, involving the fusion of two acrocentric chromosomes, are a common chromosomal rearrangement in humans and can have significant implications for fertility and genetic disorders. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern the structure and function of these regions is crucial for elucidating their role in genome stability and human health."}
