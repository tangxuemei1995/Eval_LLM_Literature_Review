{"Abstract": "This review synthesizes recent advancements in methods for assessing population relationships and history using genomic data, focusing on key areas such as demographic inference, admixture, ancestry, effective population size, and molecular clocks. We discuss the application of coalescent theory and population genetic models to infer historical population sizes and migration patterns. Novel approaches for detecting and quantifying admixture events are highlighted, along with their implications for understanding complex population structures. Additionally, we explore the use of molecular clocks to estimate the timing of divergence events and the integration of ancient DNA data to refine demographic models. The review also addresses the challenges and limitations of these methods, including issues of data quality, model assumptions, and computational complexity. Overall, the integration of these methodologies provides a robust framework for unraveling the intricate history and relationships of populations across diverse geographical and temporal scales."}
