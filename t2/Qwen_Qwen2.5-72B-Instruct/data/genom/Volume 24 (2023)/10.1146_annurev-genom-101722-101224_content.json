{"Abstract": "This review explores the intricate systems and mechanisms that facilitate the crossing of RNA molecules across cellular membranes, focusing on extracellular RNA (exRNA) and cell surface glycoRNAs. Recent discoveries have unveiled the presence of glycoRNAs, a novel class of cell surface RNAs, which are modified with glycans and play crucial roles in cell signaling and intercellular communication. The paper discusses the biogenesis, trafficking, and functional implications of these RNA species, highlighting their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Additionally, the mechanisms governing exRNA secretion and uptake, including vesicular and non-vesicular pathways, are examined, providing a comprehensive overview of the dynamic RNA trafficking landscape. This knowledge is essential for understanding the complex regulatory networks that govern cellular processes and intercellular communication."}
