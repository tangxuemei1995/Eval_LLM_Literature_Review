{"Abstract": "The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex plays a critical role in neural crest cell (NCC) development and is implicated in various diseases, including schwannoma. This complex, which includes the SMARCB1 subunit, is essential for the proper differentiation and function of Schwann cell precursors (SCPs), a subset of NCCs. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of SWI/SNF in regulating gene expression during NCC migration and differentiation. Mutations in SMARCB1, a core component of the complex, are associated with rhabdoid tumors and schwannomas, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. Additionally, the loss of NF2, a gene frequently mutated in schwannomas, disrupts SWI/SNF function, further emphasizing the complex's role in disease. This review summarizes the current understanding of the SWI/SNF complex's involvement in NCC development and its implications in schwannoma pathogenesis, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets."}
