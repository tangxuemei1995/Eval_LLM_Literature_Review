{"Abstract": "Skeletal dysplasias encompass a diverse group of genetic disorders affecting bone and cartilage development, often resulting in short or tall stature. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways play crucial roles in skeletal development and growth. This review examines the current understanding of how alterations in TGF-β and BMP signaling contribute to the pathogenesis of skeletal dysplasias characterized by atypical stature. Recent studies have identified specific mutations in genes encoding components of these pathways, such as BMPR1A, BMPR2, and TGFBR2, which are associated with both short and tall stature phenotypes. The mechanisms by which these mutations disrupt normal skeletal growth, including altered chondrocyte differentiation and bone matrix formation, are discussed. Additionally, the potential for therapeutic interventions targeting these signaling pathways to correct skeletal abnormalities is explored. Understanding the complex interplay between TGF-β and BMP signaling in skeletal dysplasias may lead to novel treatments and improved clinical outcomes for affected individuals."}
