{"Abstract": "Single-cell expression quantitative trait loci (sc-eQTL) studies have emerged as a powerful approach to dissect the genetic basis of gene regulation at an unprecedented resolution. By integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with genotyping data, these studies enable the identification of genetic variants that influence gene expression in specific cell states. Recent advancements in sc-eQTL methodologies have revealed the dynamic nature of gene regulation, highlighting the role of noncoding variants in modulating cellular functions. This review summarizes key methods and insights from sc-eQTL studies, emphasizing the importance of context-specific regulatory mechanisms. We discuss the challenges and opportunities in interpreting sc-eQTL data, including the impact of cellular heterogeneity and the integration of multi-omics data. These findings provide a foundation for understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases, paving the way for more precise and personalized medicine."}
