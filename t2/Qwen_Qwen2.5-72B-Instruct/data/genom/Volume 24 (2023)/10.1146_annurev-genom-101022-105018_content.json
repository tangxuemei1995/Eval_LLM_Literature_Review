{"Abstract": "This paper presents a personal and scientific journey through the intricate landscape of human genetics, focusing on the study of blood cells and their genetic underpinnings. The narrative begins with an exploration of hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia, and delves into the molecular mechanisms that govern these conditions. The discussion then shifts to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, a common enzymatic disorder affecting red blood cells, and its implications for oxidative stress and hemolysis. The paper also examines paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a rare acquired disorder characterized by somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells, and the role of Darwinian selection in the clonal expansion of these cells. Through this autobiographical account, the author reflects on the interplay between genetic mutations, cellular function, and evolutionary processes, highlighting the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in advancing our understanding of blood disorders."}
