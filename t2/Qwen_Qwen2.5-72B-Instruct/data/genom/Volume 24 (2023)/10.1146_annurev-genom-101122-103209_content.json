{"Abstract": "The advent of large-scale and whole genome sequencing (WGS) has revolutionized genomic research, presenting unprecedented opportunities for scientific discovery. However, it has also introduced complex ethical, legal, and social issues, particularly concerning the return of results to participants. This paper explores the evolving landscape of returning results in genomic research, focusing on primary, secondary, and incidental findings. We review current guidelines and practices, highlighting the need for a standardized approach that balances the benefits of transparency and participant autonomy with the risks of misinterpretation and psychological impact. Through a comprehensive analysis of recent studies and ethical frameworks, we argue for the development of a new normal in genomic research that prioritizes clear communication, informed consent, and ongoing engagement with participants. This approach not only enhances trust and participation but also aligns with the principles of research ethics, ensuring that the return of results is both meaningful and responsible."}
