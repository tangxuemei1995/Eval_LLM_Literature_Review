{"Abstract": "Federated analysis represents a transformative approach to data sharing, enabling collaborative research while preserving privacy and compliance with legal frameworks such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This primer explores the technical and legal dimensions of federated analysis, particularly in the context of genomics. By distributing computation across multiple sites, federated analysis minimizes data movement, reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring that sensitive information remains under local control. We discuss the technical mechanisms, including secure multi-party computation and differential privacy, that underpin federated analysis. Additionally, we examine the legal considerations, such as data minimization and purpose limitation, that must be addressed to align with GDPR requirements. This comprehensive overview aims to provide researchers and legal professionals with the necessary insights to implement federated analysis effectively and responsibly."}
