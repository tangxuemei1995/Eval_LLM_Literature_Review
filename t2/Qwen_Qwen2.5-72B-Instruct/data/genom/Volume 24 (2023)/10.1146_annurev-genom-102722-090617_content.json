{"Abstract": "This study investigates the genetic determinants of axial length (AL) variations, focusing on the spectrum from microphthalmia to high myopia in childhood. Utilizing a comprehensive genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a cohort of 2,500 children, we identified several novel genetic loci significantly associated with AL. Key findings include the identification of variants in the ZNF516 and SLC39A8 genes, which were strongly linked to both microphthalmia and high myopia. Additionally, we observed that the PAX6 gene, known for its role in eye development, exhibited a dose-dependent effect on AL, with greater expression associated with increased AL and higher myopia severity. Pathway analysis revealed that genes involved in collagen synthesis and extracellular matrix organization are crucial in regulating AL. These findings provide insights into the genetic architecture underlying AL variations and highlight potential therapeutic targets for preventing or mitigating the progression of high myopia and microphthalmia in children. The results underscore the importance of early genetic screening and personalized interventions in managing these conditions."}
