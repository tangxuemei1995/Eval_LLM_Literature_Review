{"Abstract": "DECIPHER, a dynamic platform for integrating genomic and clinical data, significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of genetic diagnosis in rare and complex genetic disorders. By leveraging advanced algorithms for variant interpretation and genotypeâ€“phenotype correlation, DECIPHER facilitates the identification of disease-causing mutations, even in cases with limited or ambiguous clinical information. This study evaluates the impact of DECIPHER on diagnostic outcomes, demonstrating a substantial increase in the rate of confirmed genetic diagnoses compared to traditional methods. The platform's ability to continuously update and refine its data through user contributions and machine learning ensures that it remains a cutting-edge tool in the field of medical genetics. Our findings highlight the critical role of integrated data platforms in improving patient care and advancing our understanding of genetic disorders."}
