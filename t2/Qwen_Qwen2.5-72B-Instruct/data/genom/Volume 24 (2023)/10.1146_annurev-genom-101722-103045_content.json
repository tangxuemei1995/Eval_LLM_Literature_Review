{"Abstract": "Long-read DNA sequencing technologies have revolutionized genomics by enabling the accurate and comprehensive characterization of complex genomic regions, including structural variants, repetitive DNA, and epigenetic modifications. Recent advances in platforms such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore have significantly improved read lengths, accuracy, and throughput, facilitating the identification of pathogenic mutations that are often missed by short-read sequencing. These technologies have also enhanced our understanding of genome structure and function, particularly in non-coding regions. However, several challenges remain, including high error rates, computational demands, and the need for robust bioinformatics tools to analyze and interpret the data. This review highlights the latest developments in long-read sequencing, discusses their applications in clinical and research settings, and addresses the ongoing technical and analytical hurdles that must be overcome to fully realize the potential of these powerful tools."}
