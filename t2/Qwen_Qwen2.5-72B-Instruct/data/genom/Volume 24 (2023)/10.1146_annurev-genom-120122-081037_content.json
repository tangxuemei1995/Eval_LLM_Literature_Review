{"Abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hereditary blood disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin, leading to distorted red blood cells and chronic complications. Recent advancements in understanding genetic modifiers have identified key factors influencing disease severity, providing new targets for therapeutic intervention. Gene therapy trials, utilizing viral vectors to deliver functional genes, have shown promising results in correcting the underlying genetic defect. However, concerns over genotoxicity and long-term safety remain critical challenges. Emerging gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9, offer precise correction of the sickle mutation, potentially providing a curative approach. This review summarizes the current state of SCD genetics, highlights recent gene therapy and gene editing advancements, and discusses the potential and limitations of these innovative treatments."}
