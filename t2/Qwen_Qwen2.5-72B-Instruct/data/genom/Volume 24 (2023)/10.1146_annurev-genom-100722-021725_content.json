{"Abstract": "The rapid advancement of genomics has introduced a complex array of legal challenges, particularly concerning liability, duty to warn, and data privacy. This paper explores the evolving legal landscape surrounding genomics, highlighting key issues such as the responsibility of healthcare providers to warn patients about potential genetic risks and the legal implications of mishandling sensitive genetic data. We review recent case law and regulatory developments, emphasizing the need for clear guidelines and best practices to mitigate legal risks. The study also discusses the ethical dimensions of these issues, advocating for a balanced approach that protects patient rights while fostering innovation in genomic research and clinical applications. By addressing these legal land mines, stakeholders can navigate the genomics landscape more effectively, ensuring both compliance and ethical integrity."}
