{"Abstract": "Padlock probe-based targeted in situ sequencing (ISS) is a powerful technique for spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT), enabling the precise localization and quantification of RNA molecules within cells and tissues. This method utilizes padlock probes and rolling circle amplification (RCA) to achieve high sensitivity and specificity. Recent advancements have expanded its applications in generating spatial cell atlases and in situ cell typing, providing unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity and tissue architecture. This review summarizes the key methods and highlights the diverse applications of padlock probe-based ISS in biological and medical research."}
