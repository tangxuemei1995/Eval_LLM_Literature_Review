{"Abstract": "The human gut microbiome plays a crucial role in health and disease, yet the genetic manipulation of its members remains a significant challenge. This study aims to expand the repertoire of genetically tractable gut bacteria by developing novel genetic tools and methods. We successfully engineered a diverse set of gut commensals, including Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, and Akkermansia species, to express foreign genes and to introduce precise genetic modifications. These advancements facilitate the study of microbial functions and interactions within the gut ecosystem, paving the way for microbiome engineering applications in therapeutics and diagnostics. Our findings represent a significant step toward harnessing the full potential of the gut microbiome for human health."}
