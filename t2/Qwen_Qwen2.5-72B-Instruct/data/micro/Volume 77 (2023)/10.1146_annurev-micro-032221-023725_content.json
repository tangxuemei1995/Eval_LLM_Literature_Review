{"Abstract": "This study explores the mechanisms of extracellular electron transfer (EET) in Shewanella and Geobacter species, focusing on the role of cytochromes and electron shuttles in facilitating electron transfer beyond the outer membrane. These microorganisms are known for their ability to transfer electrons to extracellular acceptors, a process critical for their survival in diverse environments. We investigate the structural and functional properties of outer membrane cytochromes and soluble electron shuttles, which are essential for mediating long-range electron transfer. Our findings reveal that specific cytochrome arrangements and the presence of redox-active molecules significantly enhance the efficiency of EET, enabling these bacteria to utilize a wide range of electron acceptors. This research provides insights into the biogeochemical cycling of elements and has implications for the development of microbial fuel cells and bioremediation technologies."}
