{"Abstract": "This review highlights the transformation of Listeria monocytogenes from a foodborne pathogen to a model system in infection biology and cellular microbiology. Postgenomic approaches have unveiled intricate DNA-protein interactions and RNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms, underscoring its utility in dissecting host-pathogen interactions. The journey of Listeria as a model organism reflects the evolution of microbiological research, integrating molecular, genetic, and systems biology perspectives."}
