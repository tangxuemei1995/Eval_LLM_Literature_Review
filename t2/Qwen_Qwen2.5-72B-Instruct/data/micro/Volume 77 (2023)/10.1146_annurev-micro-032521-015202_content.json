{"Abstract": "Biological soil crusts (BSCs) are complex communities of microorganisms, including cyanobacteria, lichens, mosses, and fungi, that form a living layer on the soil surface in arid and semi-arid environments. These crusts play a crucial role in stabilizing soil, preventing erosion, and enhancing nutrient cycling. Cyanobacteria, as primary colonizers, are particularly important due to their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen and carbon, contributing significantly to the biogeochemistry of these extreme environments. The resilience of BSCs to desiccation is a key factor in their survival, as they can remain dormant for extended periods and rapidly reactivate upon rehydration. Recent studies have highlighted the genetic and metabolic adaptations that enable these microorganisms to thrive under conditions of extreme desiccation and temperature fluctuations. Understanding the microbiology of BSCs is essential for developing strategies to restore degraded arid lands and for predicting the impacts of climate change on these unique ecosystems."}
