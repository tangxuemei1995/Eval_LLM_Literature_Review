{"Abstract": "The human gut phageome, a critical component of the gut microbiome, plays a significant role in maintaining host health and influencing disease states. This study investigates the factors that contribute to the variation in the gut phageome across different populations. Through a comprehensive analysis of metagenomic data from over 1,000 individuals, we identified key determinants such as diet, age, geographical location, and host genetics. Our findings reveal that dietary patterns, particularly the consumption of plant-based versus animal-based diets, significantly impact the diversity and composition of the gut phageome. Additionally, age-related changes in the gut microbiome were found to correlate with shifts in the phageome, suggesting a dynamic interplay between bacteria and their viral predators. Geographical variations also contributed to phageome diversity, with distinct profiles observed in urban versus rural populations. These insights provide a foundation for understanding the complex interactions within the gut virome and their implications for human health and disease."}
