{"Abstract": "Bacterial cross-feeding, a fundamental aspect of microbial ecology, involves the exchange of metabolites between different bacterial species. This process is crucial for the maintenance of microbial communities and the degradation of complex substrates. Recent studies have highlighted the role of active efflux mechanisms and passive leakage in the externalization of metabolites. Active efflux systems, driven by energy-dependent transporters, facilitate the directed release of specific compounds, while passive leakage occurs through membrane disruptions or cell lysis. Both mechanisms contribute to the dynamic and cooperative interactions within microbial communities. Understanding these processes is essential for elucidating the ecological and metabolic dynamics of bacterial populations, and for developing strategies to manipulate microbial consortia in biotechnological and environmental applications."}
