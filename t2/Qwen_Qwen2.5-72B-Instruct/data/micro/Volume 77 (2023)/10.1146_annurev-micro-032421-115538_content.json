{"Abstract": "Transporter proteins play a pivotal role in the ecological adaptability and functional diversity of microbial eukaryotic pangenomes. This study elucidates the distribution and evolutionary dynamics of transporter genes within the core and accessory genomes of diverse microbial eukaryotes. Our findings reveal that horizontal gene transfer and gene duplication events significantly contribute to the expansion and diversification of transporter proteins, enhancing microbial adaptability to various environmental niches. These proteins are not only crucial for nutrient acquisition and waste expulsion but also for mediating interactions with other microorganisms and host organisms, influencing virulence and symbiotic relationships. The integration of these findings into a broader ecological context highlights the importance of transporter proteins as key ecological assets, facilitating microbial survival and evolution in complex and dynamic environments."}
