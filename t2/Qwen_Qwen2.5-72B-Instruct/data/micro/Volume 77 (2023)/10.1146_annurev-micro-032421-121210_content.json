{"Abstract": "Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) play a critical role in the accurate translation of the genetic code by charging tRNAs with their cognate amino acids. In Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of malaria, aaRSs represent a promising target for antimalarial drug development. This review highlights recent advances in understanding the unique features of Plasmodium aaRSs and their potential as therapeutic targets. Specifically, we discuss the concept of reaction hijacking, a novel strategy that exploits the catalytic activity of aaRSs to introduce toxic substrates into the parasite's protein synthesis machinery. This approach has shown promising results in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating the potential of aaRSs as a viable target for the development of new antimalarial drugs. The identification of specific inhibitors and the optimization of their pharmacological properties are ongoing areas of research, with the ultimate goal of addressing the growing challenge of drug-resistant malaria."}
