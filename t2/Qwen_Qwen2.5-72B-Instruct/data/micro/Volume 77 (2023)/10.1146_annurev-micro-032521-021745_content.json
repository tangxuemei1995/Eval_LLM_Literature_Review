{"Abstract": "Recent studies have elucidated the critical role of hypoxia in the virulence and disease progression of human fungal pathogens. These pathogens adapt to low oxygen environments, enhancing their survival and resistance to antifungal drugs. Mechanisms such as altered gene expression and metabolic reprogramming under hypoxic conditions contribute to fungal virulence. Understanding these adaptations is essential for developing novel therapeutic strategies. This review summarizes the latest findings on how hypoxia influences fungal pathogenesis and highlights potential targets for antifungal interventions."}
