{"Abstract": "TonB-dependent transport systems are essential for the active transport of various substrates across the bacterial outer membrane, particularly in Gram-negative bacteria. These systems, composed of outer membrane receptors, the TonB complex, and periplasmic proteins, facilitate the uptake of nutrients and iron siderophores. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of these systems as targets for Trojan horse antibiotics, which can exploit the transport mechanism to gain entry into the bacterial cell. This review focuses on the structural and functional aspects of TonB-dependent transporters, with a particular emphasis on the Î²-barrel proteins that form the outer membrane channels. The implications for developing novel antimicrobial strategies against Bacteroidetes and other Gram-negative pathogens are discussed."}
