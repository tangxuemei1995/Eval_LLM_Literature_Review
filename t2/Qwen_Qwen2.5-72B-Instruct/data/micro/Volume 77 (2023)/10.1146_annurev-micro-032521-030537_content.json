{"Abstract": "The phc quorum-sensing (QS) system in the Ralstonia solanacearum species complex, including R. solanacearum and R. pseudosolanacearum, plays a crucial role in regulating cellâ€“cell communication, pathogenicity, and virulence. This system, primarily mediated by the PhcA transcriptional regulator and the PhcB, PhcC, and PhcR signaling molecules, coordinates the expression of genes involved in bacterial motility, biofilm formation, and the production of extracellular enzymes and toxins. Recent studies have elucidated the intricate signaling pathways and regulatory networks that underpin the phc QS system, highlighting its importance in the adaptation and survival of these pathogens in diverse environmental conditions. Understanding the mechanisms of the phc QS system is essential for developing novel strategies to control the spread and impact of R. solanacearum and R. pseudosolanacearum, which are significant threats to global agriculture."}
