{"Abstract": "Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), a reproductive manipulation induced by the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia, results in embryonic lethality when infected males mate with uninfected females or females infected with a different Wolbachia strain. This phenomenon is mediated by a toxin-antidote system, where the CI factor (CifA) acts as a toxin and the rescue factor (CifB) as an antidote. Recent studies have identified CifA and CifB as a nuclease and a deubiquitylase, respectively, suggesting that CI is regulated through post-translational modifications and DNA damage responses. Additionally, Wolbachia can induce male killing, another reproductive manipulation, which eliminates male embryos to increase the relative fitness of infected females. This review summarizes the molecular mechanisms underlying CI and male killing, highlighting the roles of CifA and CifB in these processes and their implications for population dynamics and vector control strategies."}
