{"Abstract": "The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in the metabolism of essential amino acids (EAAs), which in turn influences host health through the production of various chemical mediators. This review focuses on the microbial metabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) such as valine, isoleucine, and leucine, as well as tryptophan, and their downstream metabolites. These metabolites, including indoles and short-chain fatty acids, can modulate host physiological processes, such as immune function, gut barrier integrity, and neurotransmitter synthesis. Notably, the microbial conversion of tryptophan to serotonin has been linked to mood regulation and gut motility. Understanding the intricate interplay between host and microbial metabolism of EAAs is essential for developing targeted interventions to promote gut health and treat related disorders."}
