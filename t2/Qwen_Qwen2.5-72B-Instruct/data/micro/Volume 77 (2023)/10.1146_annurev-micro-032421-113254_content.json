{"Abstract": "The early fossil record of eukaryotes, primarily from the Proterozoic Eon, provides critical insights into the origins and early evolution of complex life. This review synthesizes current frameworks for interpreting these fossils, emphasizing the interplay between environmental changes, such as the Great Oxidation Event, and the emergence of eukaryotic lineages. We discuss the morphological and biochemical evidence from microfossils and molecular clocks, highlighting the challenges in distinguishing between prokaryotic and early eukaryotic forms. The integration of geochemical data with paleontological findings suggests that the rise of oxygen played a pivotal role in eukaryogenesis, facilitating the development of more complex cellular structures and metabolic pathways. This multidisciplinary approach offers a robust foundation for understanding the early diversification of eukaryotes and their ecological impacts during the Precambrian."}
