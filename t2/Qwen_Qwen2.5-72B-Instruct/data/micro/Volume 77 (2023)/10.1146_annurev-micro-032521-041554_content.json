{"Abstract": "Malaria, caused by Plasmodium parasites, remains a significant global health burden. Recent advances in single-cell epigenetics have unveiled the intricate mechanisms of chromatin remodeling and epigenetic regulation that govern the parasite's life cycle. This study explores the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in modulating chromatin architecture and gene expression during different stages of Plasmodium development. Using high-throughput sequencing and chromatin conformation capture techniques, we identified key lncRNAs that interact with specific chromatin regions, influencing the expression of virulence genes and drug resistance. These findings provide novel insights into the epigenetic control of Plasmodium and highlight potential targets for therapeutic intervention."}
