{"Abstract": "Fermented foods, such as cheese, sourdough, and fermented vegetables, are characterized by unique microbial communities that play a crucial role in their flavor, texture, and preservation. This study investigates the principles of microbiome assembly in these foods, focusing on the ecological and environmental factors that shape microbial diversity and community structure. Through a combination of metagenomic sequencing, culture-dependent methods, and ecological modeling, we identify key taxa and functional pathways involved in the fermentation process. Our findings reveal that initial inoculum, substrate composition, and fermentation conditions significantly influence the assembly of microbial communities. We also highlight the importance of microbial interactions, including competition and cooperation, in maintaining community stability and functionality. These insights provide a foundation for optimizing fermentation processes and enhancing the quality and safety of fermented foods."}
