{"Abstract": "Apicomplexan parasites, including Plasmodium and Toxoplasma, are significant pathogens causing diseases such as malaria and toxoplasmosis. These organisms belong to the Myzozoa, a group characterized by unique mitochondrial properties. Apicomplexan mitochondria exhibit distinctive features in their electron transport chain (ETC) and ATP synthase, which differ from those of their mammalian hosts. The ETC in these parasites often lacks complex I and has a modified complex III, while complex IV is present but with altered subunit composition. Additionally, the ATP synthase in apicomplexans has unique structural and functional characteristics, making it a potential target for antiparasitic drugs. Understanding these unique properties is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies that selectively target apicomplexan mitochondria without affecting host cells."}
