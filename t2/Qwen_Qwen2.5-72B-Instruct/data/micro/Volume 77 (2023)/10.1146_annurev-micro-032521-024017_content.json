{"Abstract": "Inflammasomes, multiprotein complexes that activate caspase-1 and caspase-8, play a pivotal role in innate immunity and inflammation. Recent studies have highlighted the intricate interplay between bacterial pathogens and inflammasome signaling, revealing both collaborative and antagonistic interactions. Bacterial components, such as lipopolysaccharides and flagellin, can trigger NLR family proteins, leading to the assembly of inflammasomes and subsequent activation of caspase-1. This activation results in the cleavage of gasdermin D, promoting pyroptosis and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conversely, some bacteria have evolved mechanisms to inhibit inflammasome activation, thereby evading host immune responses. This review discusses the molecular mechanisms by which bacteria influence inflammasome signaling, emphasizing the dual roles of bacterial factors in either promoting or suppressing inflammasome-mediated immune responses."}
