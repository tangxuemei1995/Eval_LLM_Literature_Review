{"Abstract": "Type III secretion systems (T3SS) are essential for the function of both the bacterial flagellum and the injectisome, playing critical roles in bacterial motility and pathogenicity. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) have provided unprecedented structural insights into these complex molecular machines. This study integrates high-resolution cryo-EM reconstructions with cryo-ET data to elucidate the architectural and functional similarities and differences between the flagellar T3SS and the injectisome T3SS. Key findings include the identification of conserved structural motifs and unique adaptations that facilitate the specific functions of each system. The detailed structural analysis reveals the dynamic nature of the secretion apparatus, highlighting the mechanisms of substrate recognition, translocation, and assembly. These insights enhance our understanding of the molecular basis of bacterial motility and pathogenesis, offering potential targets for therapeutic intervention."}
