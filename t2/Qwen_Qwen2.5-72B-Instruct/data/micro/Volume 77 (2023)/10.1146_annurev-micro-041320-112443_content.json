{"Abstract": "Fungi exhibit remarkable genome plasticity, enabling rapid adaptation to diverse and stressful environments. This study explores the roles of polyploidy, aneuploidy, and copy number variation (CNV) in fungal genome dynamics under stress conditions. Through comprehensive genomic analyses of multiple fungal species, we demonstrate that polyploidy and aneuploidy are frequent responses to environmental stressors, such as nutrient limitation and exposure to antifungal agents. CNV, particularly in genes related to metabolism and stress response, further contributes to adaptive phenotypic variation. These genomic changes enhance survival and fitness, highlighting the importance of genome plasticity in fungal evolution and adaptation. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying fungal resilience and have implications for understanding the evolution of pathogenicity and drug resistance."}
