{"Abstract": "Extracytoplasmic function (ECF) σ factors represent a critical component of bacterial signal transduction, mediating the transcriptional response to diverse environmental cues. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the distribution, diversity, and regulatory mechanisms of ECF σ factors across bacterial phyla. Comparative genomics reveals a widespread presence of ECF σ factors, with significant variations in their numbers and types among different species, reflecting adaptations to specific ecological niches. Recent studies highlight the intricate regulatory networks involving ECF σ factors, which often operate in conjunction with anti-σ factors and other regulatory proteins to fine-tune stress responses and metabolic adjustments. Advances in high-throughput sequencing and functional genomics have provided unprecedented insights into the dynamic interplay between ECF σ factors and their target genes, underscoring their pivotal role in bacterial survival and adaptation. Future research will focus on elucidating the structural and functional diversity of ECF σ factors, as well as their integration into broader cellular signaling pathways."}
