{"Abstract": "Secretory IgA (sIgA) plays a crucial role in mucosal immunity by neutralizing enteropathogens such as Salmonella. This study elucidates the structureâ€“function relationships of sIgA, focusing on its polymeric nature and interaction with the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR). Using a combination of biophysical and cellular assays, we demonstrate that the polymeric structure of sIgA enhances its ability to agglutinate pathogens, thereby preventing their adherence to and invasion of the intestinal epithelium. Furthermore, the interaction between sIgA and pIgR facilitates the efficient transport of sIgA across mucosal surfaces, reinforcing the first line of defense against enteric infections. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms by which sIgA mediates protection against mucosal pathogens and highlight the importance of its polymeric form in immune function."}
