{"Abstract": "The evolution of bacteria and archaea has been profoundly influenced by habitat transitions, which have driven diversification and adaptation. This study explores the mechanisms of dispersal and adaptation in microbial lineages, particularly focusing on the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) bacteria and their role in the human microbiome. By integrating environmental microbiology with genomic analyses, we reveal how these microorganisms have adapted to diverse environments, from extreme thermal vents to the human gut. Our findings highlight the importance of horizontal gene transfer and metabolic flexibility in facilitating habitat transitions. The implications of these transitions for microbial ecology and human health are discussed, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive understanding of microbial evolution across different ecological niches."}
