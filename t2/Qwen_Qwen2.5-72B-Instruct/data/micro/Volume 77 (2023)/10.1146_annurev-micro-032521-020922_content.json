{"Abstract": "This study explores the diversity and ecological roles of fungi in two extreme environments: glacial ice and hypersaline waters. Fungi in these habitats exhibit unique adaptations, such as psychrophilic and halophilic properties, enabling them to thrive under conditions of low temperature and high salinity. Through metagenomic analysis and culture-dependent methods, we identified novel fungal species and characterized their metabolic pathways. Our findings suggest that these extremophilic fungi play crucial roles in nutrient cycling and may harbor biotechnological potential for applications in cold and saline environments. The research enhances our understanding of microbial ecology in extreme conditions and contributes to the broader field of extremophile biology."}
