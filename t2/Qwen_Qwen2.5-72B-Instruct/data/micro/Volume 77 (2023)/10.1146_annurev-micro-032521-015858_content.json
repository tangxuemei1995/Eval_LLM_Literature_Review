{"Abstract": "Candida auris, an emerging multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen, has garnered significant attention due to its rapid global spread and the challenges it poses in clinical settings. This study investigates the genetic underpinnings of C. auris, focusing on mechanisms of antifungal drug resistance, particularly to azoles, amphotericin B, and echinocandins. Through comprehensive genomic analysis, we identified key mutations in genes involved in cell wall synthesis and MAP kinase signaling pathways, which are crucial for the organism's survival and resistance. These findings provide insights into the molecular basis of C. auris's resilience and highlight potential targets for the development of novel antifungal therapies. Understanding these genetic adaptations is essential for combating the emergence and spread of this formidable pathogen."}
