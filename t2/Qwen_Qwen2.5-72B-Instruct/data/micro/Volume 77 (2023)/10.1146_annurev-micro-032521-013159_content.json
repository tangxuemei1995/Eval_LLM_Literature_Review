{"Abstract": "Brucella, a genus of Alphaproteobacteria, is a gram-negative, intracellular pathogen responsible for zoonotic brucellosis. The cell envelope of Brucella plays a critical role in its pathogenicity and survival within host cells. This envelope is composed of an outer membrane, a periplasmic space, and an inner membrane, with unique lipopolysaccharides and outer membrane proteins that facilitate evasion of the host immune system and adaptation to intracellular environments. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of specific envelope components in modulating host cell interactions and virulence. Understanding the structure and function of the Brucella cell envelope is essential for developing novel therapeutic strategies and vaccines against brucellosis."}
