{"Abstract": "Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, play a pivotal role in the tumor microenvironment by facilitating intercellular communication and modulating various aspects of tumor biology. These EVs carry a diverse array of cargoes, such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, which can be transferred to recipient cells, including carcinoma-associated fibroblasts and tumor-infiltrating immune cells. This transfer of EV cargoes can influence cell migration, promote tumor invasion, and alter the immune response, thereby contributing to tumor progression and metastasis. Recent advances in the characterization of tumor-derived EVs have highlighted their potential as biomarkers in liquid biopsies, offering a non-invasive means to monitor disease status and response to therapy. Understanding the multifaceted functions of tumor-derived EVs is crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting the tumor microenvironment."}
