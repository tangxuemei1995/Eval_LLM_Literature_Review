{"Abstract": "The liver exhibits a remarkable spatiotemporal organization, with distinct metabolic functions distributed across its lobules, influenced by circadian rhythms and WNT signaling. This zonation is critical for efficient hepatic detoxification and metabolic homeostasis. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying this spatial lobular organization, highlighting the role of WNT signaling in establishing and maintaining metabolic zonation. Disruptions in this zonation, often observed in liver monogenic diseases and other pathologies, can lead to impaired metabolic function and increased susceptibility to liver damage. Moreover, the interplay between circadian rhythms and metabolic zonation has significant implications for chronopharmacology, suggesting that the timing of drug administration can affect therapeutic outcomes. Understanding the complex interrelationships between liver zonation, circadian rhythms, and metabolic pathways is essential for developing targeted therapies and improving the management of liver diseases. This review synthesizes current knowledge on liver zonation and its consequences on pathophysiology, providing insights into potential therapeutic strategies."}
