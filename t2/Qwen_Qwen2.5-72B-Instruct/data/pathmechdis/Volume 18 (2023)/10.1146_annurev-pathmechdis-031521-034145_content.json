{"Abstract": "Parkinson's syndrome, encompassing idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonism, is characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms, with significant genetic and clinical heterogeneity. Recent advances in functional genomics have highlighted the role of oligogenic inheritance, where multiple genetic variants contribute to disease susceptibility. Key genes, such as GBA and LRRK2, are associated with lysosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction, respectively, while alpha-synuclein plays a critical role in synaptic pathology. These genetic factors interact to disrupt cellular processes, leading to the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons. Understanding the complex interplay between these genetic elements and their impact on cellular pathways, including protein aggregation and neuroinflammation, is crucial for developing targeted therapies. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the genetic architecture and pathogenic mechanisms of Parkinson's syndrome, emphasizing the importance of a multifaceted approach to unravel the disease's heterogeneity."}
