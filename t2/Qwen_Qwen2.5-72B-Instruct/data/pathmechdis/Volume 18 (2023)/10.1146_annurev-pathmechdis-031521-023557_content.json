{"Abstract": "Collective migration of tumor cell clusters plays a pivotal role in the metastatic cascade, facilitating polyclonal seeding and enhancing the invasive potential of cancer cells. This review elucidates the mechanisms by which circulating tumor cell clusters orchestrate collective migration and metastasis, emphasizing the importance of collective signaling and intercellular communication. Recent studies highlight the advantages of cluster migration, including increased survival in the bloodstream and enhanced colonization of distant organs. Understanding these processes is crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies to target collective metastasis and improve patient outcomes."}
