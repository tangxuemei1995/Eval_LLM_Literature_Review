{"Abstract": "Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) remains a significant global health burden, with recent advances shedding light on its complex pathogenesis. This review highlights the pivotal roles of programmed cell death (PCD) mechanisms, pattern recognition receptors (PRR), and the complement system in the development and progression of ALD. Emerging evidence suggests that PCD pathways, including apoptosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis, contribute to hepatocyte injury and inflammation. PRRs, such as Toll-like receptors, are activated by alcohol-derived products and microbial components from the gut, exacerbating liver damage. The complement system, a key component of innate immunity, is also implicated in ALD through its involvement in inflammation and tissue injury. Additionally, the gut-liver axis plays a crucial role, as alcohol disrupts the intestinal barrier, leading to increased translocation of gut-derived endotoxins and bacteria to the liver. These findings underscore the multifaceted nature of ALD and provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention."}
