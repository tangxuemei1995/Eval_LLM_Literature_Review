{"Abstract": "Tuft cells, a conserved cell lineage found in various epithelial tissues, play a crucial role in mucosal immunity and homeostasis. These cells are characterized by their unique morphology and expression of specific markers such as IL-25 and acetylcholine. Recent studies have highlighted the context- and tissue-specific programming of tuft cells, which can modulate mucociliary clearance and type 2 immunity. For instance, in the gut, tuft cells are involved in type II taste transduction and the production of cysteinyl leukotrienes, which can influence immune responses. In the respiratory tract, tuft cells contribute to the maintenance of mucociliary clearance and the defense against parasitic infections. This review discusses the diverse functions of tuft cells across different tissues and the molecular mechanisms underlying their tissue-specific programming, emphasizing their importance in maintaining tissue homeostasis and immune responses."}
