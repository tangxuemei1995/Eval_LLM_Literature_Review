{"Abstract": "Neuroepithelial interactions play a critical role in the progression and metastasis of various cancers. This review explores the bidirectional communication between nerves and cancer cells, focusing on the processes of axonogenesis and neurogenesis within the tumor microenvironment. Recent studies have highlighted the perineural invasion as a key mechanism by which cancer cells exploit neuronal structures to facilitate their spread. Additionally, the transdifferentiation of cancer cells into neuronal-like phenotypes has been observed, suggesting a potential for cancer cells to adopt neurogenic properties. These interactions not only influence tumor growth and invasion but also impact therapeutic responses. Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these neuroepithelial interactions could provide novel targets for cancer therapy, potentially disrupting the perineural niche and inhibiting cancer progression."}
