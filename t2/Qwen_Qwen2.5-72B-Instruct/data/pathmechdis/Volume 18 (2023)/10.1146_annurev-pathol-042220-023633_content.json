{"Abstract": "Adipose tissue remodeling is a dynamic process that plays a critical role in various pathophysiological conditions, including burns, cachexia, and infectious diseases. This review highlights the mechanisms underlying adipose tissue browning and fibrosis, which are key aspects of this remodeling. Browning, characterized by the increase in brown adipose tissue (BAT) or the appearance of beige adipocytes in white adipose tissue (WAT), can influence energy expenditure and metabolic homeostasis. Conversely, fibrosis, marked by excessive extracellular matrix deposition, can impair adipose tissue function and contribute to systemic inflammation. In burns and cachexia, adipose tissue undergoes significant changes, often leading to a loss of adipose mass and altered metabolic function. Similarly, in infectious diseases, adipose tissue can serve as a reservoir for pathogens and a site of immune cell activation, further complicating the inflammatory response. Understanding these processes is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of adipose tissue remodeling in these conditions."}
