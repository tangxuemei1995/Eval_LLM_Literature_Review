{"Abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has emerged as a significant global health concern, particularly due to its association with severe neurological complications and congenital malformations. This study elucidates the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection, focusing on viral tropism, the role of ubiquitin, and the antagonism of host immune responses. We demonstrate that ZIKV preferentially targets neural progenitor cells, which may explain the high incidence of microcephaly in infected fetuses. The viral NS1 protein interacts with TRIM7, a host ubiquitin ligase, to modulate the ubiquitination of key signaling molecules, thereby suppressing type I interferon responses. This antagonism of immune responses facilitates viral replication and dissemination. Additionally, we identify specific ubiquitin-dependent pathways that are hijacked by ZIKV to enhance its pathogenicity. These findings provide critical insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ZIKV pathogenesis and highlight potential therapeutic targets for intervention."}
