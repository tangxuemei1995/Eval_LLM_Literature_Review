{"Abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is characterized by an extensive desmoplastic stroma, which contributes to tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. This review highlights the role of the tumor microenvironment, particularly cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and immune cells, in modulating the tumor's aggressive behavior. CAFs secrete growth factors and cytokines that promote tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis, while also creating a physical barrier that hinders drug delivery. Immune cells within the microenvironment, such as T regulatory cells and macrophages, often suppress antitumor immunity. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies that target both the tumor and its microenvironment, potentially overcoming resistance and improving patient outcomes."}
