{"Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a multifactorial disease influenced by genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, with metabolism playing a pivotal role in its development and progression. Recent studies have highlighted the intricate relationship between metabolic pathways, dietary habits, and the gut microbiome in CRC. Altered metabolic profiles, such as increased glucose uptake and lipid synthesis, are common in CRC cells, contributing to their survival and proliferation. Diet, particularly high in red and processed meats and low in fiber, has been linked to an increased risk of CRC through mechanisms that affect gut microbiota composition and metabolic outputs. The gut microbiome, in turn, modulates host metabolism and immune responses, influencing CRC risk and progression. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the metabolic alterations in CRC, the impact of diet, and the role of the gut microbiome, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets and preventive strategies."}
