{"Abstract": "Osteoclasts, the primary bone-resorbing cells, play a critical role in the dynamic process of bone remodeling. These multinucleated giant cells are derived from hematopoietic precursors and are essential for maintaining bone homeostasis. Osteoclastogenesis, the differentiation and activation of osteoclasts, is tightly regulated by a complex interplay of cytokines and signaling pathways, including RANKL, M-CSF, and osteoprotegerin. Dysregulation of these processes can lead to pathological conditions such as osteoporosis, osteolytic lesions, and Pagetâ€™s disease. Recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying osteoclast function have highlighted the importance of these cells in both physiological and pathological bone resorption. This review summarizes the current knowledge on osteoclast biology, focusing on their role in bone remodeling and the potential therapeutic targets for osteolytic diseases."}
