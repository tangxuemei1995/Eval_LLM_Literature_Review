{"Abstract": "Molecular monitoring of lymphomas through circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a critical tool for assessing measurable residual disease (MRD) and evaluating treatment response. Utilizing next-generation sequencing (NGS), this approach enables the detection of minimal residual disease with high sensitivity and specificity, facilitating early identification of relapse and guiding personalized therapy. This review summarizes recent advancements in ctDNA analysis for lymphoma, highlighting its potential to improve clinical outcomes by providing real-time, non-invasive monitoring of disease status."}
