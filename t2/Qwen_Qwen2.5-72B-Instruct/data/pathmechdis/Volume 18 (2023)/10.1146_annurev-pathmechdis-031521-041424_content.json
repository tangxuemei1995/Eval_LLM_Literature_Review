{"Abstract": "Oropharyngeal carcinoma, particularly human papillomavirus (HPV)-related squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), has emerged as a distinct clinical and molecular entity within head and neck cancers. This review focuses on the unique characteristics of HPV-positive oropharyngeal SCC, which often presents as nonkeratinizing or basaloid variants. HPV infection, primarily by high-risk subtypes such as HPV-16, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of these tumors, driving oncogenic transformation through the expression of E6 and E7 oncoproteins. These oncoproteins disrupt cellular processes, leading to immune escape mechanisms that allow the tumor to evade host immune surveillance. Recent advances in immunotherapy and targeted treatments have shown promise in improving outcomes for patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal SCC. However, further research is needed to elucidate the complex interplay between HPV infection, immune response, and tumor biology to optimize therapeutic strategies and enhance patient survival."}
