{"Abstract": "Asthma, a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways, is characterized by airway obstruction, hyperresponsiveness, and remodeling. Despite significant advances in understanding its pathology, the precise mechanisms underlying airway obstruction remain elusive. This review focuses on the role of mucus hypersecretion and the emerging importance of galectin-10, a protein involved in modulating immune responses. Galectin-10 has been shown to influence the recruitment and activation of neutrophils, which contribute to airway inflammation and mucus production. Neutrophils, traditionally associated with acute infections, are increasingly recognized as key players in the chronic inflammation observed in asthma. By examining the interplay between galectin-10, neutrophils, and mucus, this study aims to elucidate the complex pathways that lead to airway obstruction, potentially opening new avenues for therapeutic intervention."}
