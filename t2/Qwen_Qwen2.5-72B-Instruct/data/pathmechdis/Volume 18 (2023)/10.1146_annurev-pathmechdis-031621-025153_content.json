{"Abstract": "African trypanosomiasis, commonly known as sleeping sickness, is a parasitic disease caused by Trypanosoma brucei, transmitted by the tsetse fly. The pathogenesis of this disease is characterized by the parasite's ability to evade the host immune system through antigenic variation, primarily mediated by the expression of variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs). This continuous switching of VSGs allows the parasite to persist in the host, leading to chronic infection and severe clinical manifestations. Recent studies have also highlighted the role of host factors, such as apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1), in the defense against trypanosomes. However, genetic variations in APOL1 can predispose individuals to kidney disease, complicating the clinical outcomes of African trypanosomiasis. Understanding the interplay between parasite evasion mechanisms and host defense responses is crucial for developing effective therapeutic and preventive strategies against this debilitating disease."}
