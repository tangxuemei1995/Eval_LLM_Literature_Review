{"Abstract": "Mastocytosis, a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by the abnormal accumulation of mast cells, has seen significant advances in understanding its pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment. The KIT D816V mutation is a key genetic risk factor, present in over 90% of adult cases, driving mast cell proliferation and activation. Recent studies have elucidated the role of tryptase and other mast cell mediators in the development of systemic symptoms, including anaphylaxis. Novel diagnostic approaches, such as liquid biopsy and advanced imaging techniques, have improved the accuracy of prognostication. Targeted therapies, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents, are emerging as promising treatments, offering more personalized and effective management options. This review summarizes the latest insights into the etiology and pathophysiology of mastocytosis, highlighting the clinical implications of these findings for improved patient outcomes."}
