{"Abstract": "Red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunization is a significant complication in transfusion medicine, particularly in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). This phenomenon occurs when an individual develops antibodies against foreign RBC antigens, leading to hemolytic reactions. The development of alloantibodies can complicate future transfusions and increase the risk of acute and delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions. This review examines the mechanisms underlying RBC alloimmunization, including genetic and environmental factors, and discusses the clinical consequences, such as increased morbidity and mortality in SCD patients. Strategies to prevent and manage alloimmunization, including extended antigen matching and the use of immunomodulatory agents, are also explored. Understanding the complex interplay between host factors and transfusion practices is crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden of alloimmunization in high-risk populations."}
