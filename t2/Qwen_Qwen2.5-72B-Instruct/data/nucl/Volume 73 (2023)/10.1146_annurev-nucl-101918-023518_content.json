{"Abstract": "The COHERENT experiment at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) has made significant strides in the study of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEνNS). This process, predicted by the Standard Model, is a sensitive probe for new physics, including interactions with supernova neutrinos and dark matter. The experiment utilizes a variety of detector technologies to observe CEνNS, providing insights into neutrino interactions at low energies. Recent results from COHERENT have confirmed the CEνNS cross-section, enhancing our understanding of neutrino properties and their role in astrophysical phenomena. The implications of these findings extend to the detection of supernova neutrinos and the search for dark matter, offering a unique window into the fundamental nature of the universe."}
