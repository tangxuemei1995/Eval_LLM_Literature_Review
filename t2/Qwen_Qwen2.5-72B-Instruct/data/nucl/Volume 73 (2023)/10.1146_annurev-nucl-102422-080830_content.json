{"Abstract": "The gauge hierarchy problem, a cornerstone of particle physics, poses a significant challenge to the naturalness of the Standard Model, particularly concerning the Higgs boson mass. This paper explores novel solutions to this problem, focusing on mechanisms that relax the fine-tuning required to maintain the Higgs mass at the electroweak scale. We review recent developments in relaxation mechanisms, including composite Higgs models, extra-dimensional scenarios, and dynamical symmetry breaking. These approaches aim to stabilize the Higgs mass against quantum corrections, thereby addressing the hierarchy between the electroweak and Planck scales. Our analysis highlights the potential of these models to provide a natural explanation for the observed Higgs mass, while also predicting new particles and interactions that could be tested at current and future collider experiments. The implications of these solutions for the broader landscape of beyond-the-Standard-Model physics are discussed, emphasizing their role in guiding future theoretical and experimental efforts."}
