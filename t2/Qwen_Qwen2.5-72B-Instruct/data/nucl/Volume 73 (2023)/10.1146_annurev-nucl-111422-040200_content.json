{"Abstract": "This study explores the high-energy to ultrahigh-energy neutrino interactions, crucial for understanding cosmic phenomena. Using advanced detectors, we analyzed neutrino fluxes and interaction rates, revealing insights into neutrino properties and their astrophysical sources. The findings enhance our knowledge of neutrino oscillations and the mechanisms of cosmic ray production, contributing significantly to the field of neutrino astrophysics."}
