{"Abstract": "The Hubble tension, the discrepancy between the locally measured Hubble constant (H0) and the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in the standard Î›CDM model, has emerged as a significant challenge in modern cosmology. This paper explores the potential of early dark energy (EDE) as a viable solution to this tension. EDE is a form of dark energy that is dynamically significant only during the early stages of the Universe's evolution, before the onset of the standard dark energy dominance. We present a comprehensive analysis of the impact of EDE on the CMB and large-scale structure, using the latest observational data from the Planck satellite and other cosmological probes. Our results indicate that the inclusion of EDE can significantly alleviate the Hubble tension, bringing the inferred value of H0 into better agreement with local measurements. We also discuss the implications of EDE for the early Universe, including its effects on the primordial power spectrum and the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. This work provides a robust framework for understanding the Hubble tension and highlights the need for further observational tests to confirm the presence of EDE."}
