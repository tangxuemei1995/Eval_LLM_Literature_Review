{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) have significantly enhanced our understanding of (semi-)leptonic decays of charmed hadrons. This review summarizes the latest experimental and theoretical progress, focusing on the precise determination of decay constants and form factors, which are crucial for testing the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa (CKM) matrix and lepton flavor universality. New LQCD calculations and experimental measurements from facilities such as LHCb and Belle II have provided stringent constraints on CKM matrix elements, contributing to the ongoing efforts to resolve discrepancies in lepton flavor universality. These findings are essential for refining our understanding of charm physics and the Standard Model."}
