{"Abstract": "The accurate detection and calibration of low-energy nuclear recoils are crucial for advancing the sensitivity of dark matter and coherent elastic neutrino nucleus scattering (CEνNS) experiments. This study presents a comprehensive approach to calibrating detectors for low-energy nuclear recoils, utilizing neutron scatter techniques. We detail the experimental setup and analysis methods, including the use of advanced simulation tools to model the response of the detector to nuclear recoils. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in the energy threshold and resolution, enabling more precise measurements of low-energy events. This work paves the way for enhanced sensitivity in the search for dark matter particles and the study of CEνNS, contributing to a deeper understanding of fundamental physics phenomena."}
