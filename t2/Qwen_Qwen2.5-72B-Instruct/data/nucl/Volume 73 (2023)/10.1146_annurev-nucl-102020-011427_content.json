{"Abstract": "The top quark, being the heaviest known elementary particle, plays a crucial role in exploring physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). This review examines recent theoretical and experimental advancements in BSM physics associated with the top quark, focusing on the hierarchy problem, flavor physics, and dark matter. We discuss the implications of top quark interactions for new physics scenarios, including supersymmetry and composite Higgs models. Experimental results from the LHC and future collider prospects are highlighted, emphasizing the potential for discovering new particles and interactions that could address the outstanding questions in particle physics."}
