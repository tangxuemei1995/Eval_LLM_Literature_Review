{"Abstract": "This study investigates the production and interactions of diboson systems at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), focusing on the electroweak processes and vector boson scattering. Utilizing data from recent LHC runs, we analyze the kinematic distributions and invariant mass spectra of WW, WZ, and ZZ boson pairs. The results provide stringent tests of the Standard Model predictions and offer insights into the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. Enhanced sensitivity to anomalous couplings and potential new physics beyond the Standard Model is achieved through detailed comparisons with theoretical models. The observed diboson production rates and angular distributions are consistent with the electroweak theory, while deviations in specific kinematic regions suggest the need for further investigation. This research contributes to the broader understanding of fundamental particle interactions and the validation of the electroweak sector at high energies."}
