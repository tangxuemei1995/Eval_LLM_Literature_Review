{"Abstract": "This study investigates lepton flavor violation (LFV) and lepton flavor universality violation (LFUV) in the decays of heavy mesons containing b and c quarks, utilizing data from the LHCb experiment. The analysis focuses on the precision measurement of branching ratios and asymmetries in semileptonic decays, which can provide sensitive probes for physics beyond the Standard Model. The results are compared with theoretical predictions, highlighting discrepancies that may indicate new physics. The implications for the symmetries of fundamental interactions and the potential for new particles or interactions are discussed, emphasizing the importance of these measurements in constraining models of new physics."}
