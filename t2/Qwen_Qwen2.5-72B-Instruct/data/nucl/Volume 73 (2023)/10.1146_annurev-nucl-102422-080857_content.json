{"Abstract": "The s-process, a critical nucleosynthesis mechanism, primarily occurs in AGB stars and massive stars, where neutron captures on iron-peak elements lead to the formation of heavier isotopes. This review explores recent advancements in understanding the s-process, including its role in stellar spectroscopy and the implications for meteoritic anomalies. New observational data and theoretical models are discussed, highlighting the importance of neutron density and temperature conditions in AGB stars. The abstract also addresses the contribution of massive stars to the s-process and the potential for these processes to explain isotopic variations observed in meteorites."}
