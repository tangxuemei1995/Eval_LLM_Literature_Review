{"Abstract": "Ultra-high-energy gamma-ray astronomy has entered a new era with the advent of advanced observatories such as the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). This paper presents recent findings from LHAASO, focusing on the detection of ultra-high-energy gamma rays from the Crab Nebula, a well-known supernova remnant. The Crab Nebula has long been a benchmark source for high-energy astrophysics, and recent observations have revealed the presence of a PeVatron, a cosmic accelerator capable of producing particles with energies exceeding 1 PeV (10^15 eV). The extensive air shower (EAS) technique, employed by LHAASO, has been crucial in identifying these high-energy gamma rays. The muon content of the EAS, in particular, provides a powerful tool for distinguishing gamma-ray signals from cosmic-ray backgrounds. This study not only confirms the existence of a PeVatron in the Crab Nebula but also sheds light on the mechanisms of cosmic-ray acceleration and propagation in extreme astrophysical environments. The implications of these findings extend to our understanding of the sources and distribution of cosmic rays in the Milky Way, offering new insights into the high-energy universe."}
