{"Abstract": "This study explores the implications of large-N_c QCD for the two-nucleon (NN) interaction, leveraging effective field theories to elucidate the underlying dynamics. By considering the limit where the number of colors N_c is large, we derive constraints on the NN potential that are consistent with the symmetries and structure of QCD. Our analysis reveals that the leading-order contributions to the NN interaction are dominated by meson exchanges, with corrections suppressed by powers of 1/N_c. These findings provide a robust framework for understanding few-nucleon interactions and offer insights into the role of higher-order corrections in nuclear physics."}
