{"Abstract": "The top quark, the heaviest known elementary particle, plays a crucial role in testing the Standard Model and exploring physics beyond it. This review appraises the current state of top quark physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and outlines the prospects for future discoveries. Recent measurements of top quark properties, including its mass, cross section, and decay modes, have provided stringent tests of the Standard Model. The interplay between strong and electroweak interactions in top quark production and decay has been probed with unprecedented precision. Additionally, the association of top quarks with the Higgs boson has been observed, offering insights into the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. However, several anomalies and tensions with the Standard Model predictions suggest the potential for new physics. Future runs of the LHC, with increased luminosity and improved detector technologies, will enhance the sensitivity to rare processes and subtle deviations, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the fundamental forces and particles."}
