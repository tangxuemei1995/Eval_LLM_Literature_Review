{"Abstract": "This study investigates the presence of deep-sea and lunar radioisotopes, such as 60Fe and 244Pu, as tracers of nearby astrophysical explosions, specifically supernovae. Utilizing accelerator mass spectrometry, we analyzed samples from the ocean floor and lunar regolith to detect these isotopes, which are products of the r-process nucleosynthesis. Our findings suggest that these radioisotopes provide direct evidence of supernova events within the last few million years, offering insights into the frequency and impact of such cosmic phenomena on Earth and the Moon. The results contribute to our understanding of the astrophysical processes that influence the interstellar medium and the solar system."}
