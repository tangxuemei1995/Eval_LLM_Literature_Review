{"Abstract": "In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the formation of a quark–gluon plasma (QGP) leads to complex interactions between jets and the medium. This study investigates the medium response and jet–hadron correlations in such collisions, focusing on the phenomena of jet quenching and jet-induced medium excitation. Jet quenching, the suppression of high-energy jets due to energy loss in the QGP, is a key observable for understanding the properties of the medium. Jet-induced medium excitation, where jets deposit energy and momentum into the QGP, results in observable modifications of the medium's flow and hadron spectra. By analyzing jet–hadron correlations, this research provides insights into the dynamics of the QGP and the interplay between jets and the medium. The results are consistent with theoretical models predicting significant modifications of jet properties and enhanced hadron correlations in the presence of a dense, strongly interacting medium."}
