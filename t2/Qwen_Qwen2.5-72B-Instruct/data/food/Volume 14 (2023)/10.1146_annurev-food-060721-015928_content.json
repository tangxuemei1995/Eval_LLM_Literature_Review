{"Abstract": "Bacteriophages pose a significant threat to the efficiency and quality of dairy fermentations, particularly in cheese and yogurt production. This review examines the current understanding of phageâ€“host interactions and the mechanisms by which dairy bacteria develop phage resistance. Recent studies highlight the role of CRISPR-Cas systems and abortive infection strategies in conferring resistance, while also exploring the potential for conjugation to spread resistance genes among bacterial populations. Despite these advancements, the dynamic nature of phage populations necessitates ongoing research to develop robust strategies for phage control. The integration of molecular biology and traditional fermentation practices offers promising solutions to mitigate the impact of bacteriophages, ensuring the sustainability and quality of dairy products."}
