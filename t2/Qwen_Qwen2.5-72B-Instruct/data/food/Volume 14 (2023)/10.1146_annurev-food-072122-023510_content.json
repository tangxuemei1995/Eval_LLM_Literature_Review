{"Abstract": "This study explores the enzymatic approaches for structuring starch to enhance its functionality, focusing on the relationship between molecular structure and performance. Enzymatic modification, including branching, debranching, and transglycosylation, was employed to alter the starch structure, leading to improved properties such as solubility, gel strength, and thermal stability. The enzymatic strategies were tailored to specific applications, such as food processing, pharmaceuticals, and bioplastics. The results demonstrated that precise control over the enzymatic reactions can significantly influence the starch's molecular architecture, thereby optimizing its functional attributes. For instance, the use of specific isoamylase enzymes led to the production of starch with enhanced gelatinization properties, suitable for thickening and binding in food products. Similarly, the application of cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase resulted in starch derivatives with improved solubility and emulsifying properties, beneficial for pharmaceutical formulations. The study underscores the potential of enzymatic approaches in tailoring starch for a wide range of industrial applications, highlighting the importance of understanding the structure-function relationship in starch modification."}
