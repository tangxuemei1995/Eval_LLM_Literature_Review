{"Abstract": "Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a phytochemical found in cruciferous vegetables, has garnered attention for its potential health benefits. This review summarizes the occurrence of I3C in dietary sources and its bioactive metabolite, 3,3â€²-diindolylmethane (DIM). Studies have shown that I3C and DIM exhibit anti-carcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties, which are attributed to their ability to modulate key cellular and molecular pathways. These include the regulation of phase I and phase II detoxification enzymes, modulation of estrogen metabolism, and inhibition of inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, I3C and DIM have been shown to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in various cancer cell lines. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms underlying the health-beneficial properties of I3C and DIM, highlighting their potential as dietary supplements and therapeutic agents."}
