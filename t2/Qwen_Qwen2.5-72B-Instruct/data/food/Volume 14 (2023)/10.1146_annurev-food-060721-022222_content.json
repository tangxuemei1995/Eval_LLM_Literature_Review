{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of bioinformatic approaches to characterize the molecular structure and function of food proteins, integrating computational biology and data science. Advanced protein modeling techniques were employed to predict the three-dimensional structures and functional sites of key food proteins, enhancing our understanding of their roles in food processing and nutrition. Materials characterization methods, such as molecular dynamics simulations, were utilized to assess the stability and interactions of these proteins under various conditions. The findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying protein functionality, which can be leveraged to optimize food product development and improve nutritional quality. This interdisciplinary approach highlights the potential of bioinformatics in advancing the field of food science and technology."}
