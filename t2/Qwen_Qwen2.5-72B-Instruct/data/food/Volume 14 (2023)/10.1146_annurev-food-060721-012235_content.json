{"Abstract": "This review provides a comprehensive overview of the applications of the INFOGEST in vitro digestion model to various food types, focusing on its utility in assessing bioaccessibility and bioavailability of nutrients and bioactive compounds. The INFOGEST model, which simulates the dynamic conditions of the human gastrointestinal tract, has been widely adopted to evaluate the impact of food processing and matrix composition on nutrient release and absorption. Studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in predicting the bioaccessibility of proteins, lipids, and micronutrients from both conventional and functional foods. The model's ability to mimic physiological conditions, including pH changes, enzymatic activities, and the presence of bile and pancreatic fluids, enhances its relevance for nutritional and food science research. This review also highlights recent advancements and potential future directions, emphasizing the model's role in optimizing food formulations for improved health outcomes."}
