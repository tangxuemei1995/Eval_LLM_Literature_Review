{"Abstract": "Dietary fiber interventions hold significant promise for modulating the gut microbiome to improve health outcomes, yet individual responses to these interventions are highly variable. This study explores the potential of precision nutrition approaches to predict and optimize personalized responses to dietary fiber. By integrating data on gut microbial composition, carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), and host genetic factors, we identify key biomarkers that correlate with favorable outcomes following prebiotic supplementation. Our findings suggest that the presence of specific microbial taxa and CAZyme profiles can serve as predictive indicators of an individual's response to dietary fiber. These insights pave the way for tailored nutritional strategies that enhance the efficacy of fiber interventions, ultimately contributing to the prevention and management of chronic diseases. The study underscores the importance of a holistic, personalized approach to nutrition in the context of gut microbiome modulation."}
