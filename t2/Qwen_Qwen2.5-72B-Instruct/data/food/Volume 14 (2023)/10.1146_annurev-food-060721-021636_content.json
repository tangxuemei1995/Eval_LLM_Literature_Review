{"Abstract": "This study explores the strategic placement of phenolic antioxidants at the oilâ€“water interface in emulsions to enhance their efficacy in preventing lipid oxidation. By modifying phenolic compounds to form phenolipids, we demonstrate their preferential accumulation at the interface, creating a robust antioxidant reservoir. This approach not only maximizes the antioxidant activity but also improves the stability and shelf life of emulsified food products. The interfacial location of these antioxidants is confirmed through surface tension measurements and fluorescence microscopy. The results highlight the benefits of this targeted delivery method, offering a promising strategy for the food industry to develop more effective and stable emulsion-based products."}
