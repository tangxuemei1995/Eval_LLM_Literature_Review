{"Abstract": "This critical review examines the role of bovine colostrum in enhancing health outcomes for both animals and humans. Rich in immunoglobulins and bioactive proteins, bovine colostrum has been shown to support immune function, promote gut health, and offer therapeutic benefits in various clinical settings. The review synthesizes current research on the efficacy of bovine colostrum as a functional food and its potential applications in veterinary and human medicine. Key findings highlight the importance of standardized processing methods to preserve bioactivity and the need for further clinical trials to establish dosage guidelines and long-term safety."}
