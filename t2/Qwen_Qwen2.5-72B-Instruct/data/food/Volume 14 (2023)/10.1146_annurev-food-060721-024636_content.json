{"Abstract": "This review provides a comprehensive update on the recent advancements in microgreen cultivation, focusing on their nutritional profile, production systems, and potential applications in home, commercial, and space farming. Microgreens, known for their high nutrient density, have gained significant attention as a sustainable food source. Recent studies highlight their role in enhancing food security and dietary diversity. The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in microgreen production systems has optimized growth conditions, reducing water and energy consumption while increasing yield. Additionally, the adaptability of microgreens to controlled environment agriculture makes them ideal candidates for space farming, contributing to the development of life support systems in long-duration space missions. This review synthesizes the latest findings and discusses the future directions for microgreen research and application."}
