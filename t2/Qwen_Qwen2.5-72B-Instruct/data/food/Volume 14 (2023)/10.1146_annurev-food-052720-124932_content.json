{"Abstract": "This study investigates the molecular changes in meat proteins during various processing techniques and their subsequent effects on the quality and nutritional value of meat products. Key findings reveal that thermal processing, such as cooking and pasteurization, can lead to protein denaturation and aggregation, which may alter texture and reduce digestibility. Additionally, the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) during processing is linked to potential health risks, including increased oxidative stress and inflammation. Understanding these molecular transformations is crucial for optimizing processing methods to enhance the nutritional profile and safety of meat products."}
