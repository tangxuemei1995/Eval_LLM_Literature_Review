{"Abstract": "Ergothioneine (ERGO), a diet-derived antioxidant, has garnered significant attention for its unique cytoprotective properties. This sulfur-containing amino acid is selectively accumulated in mammalian tissues via the OCTN1 transporter, highlighting its physiological importance. ERGO exhibits potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, particularly in mitochondria, where it mitigates oxidative stress and preserves mitochondrial function. Studies have shown that ERGO can reduce inflammation and protect cells from damage, making it a promising candidate for therapeutic interventions in various oxidative stress-related diseases. This review summarizes the current understanding of ERGO's mechanisms of action, its dietary sources, and its potential health benefits, emphasizing its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing disease."}
