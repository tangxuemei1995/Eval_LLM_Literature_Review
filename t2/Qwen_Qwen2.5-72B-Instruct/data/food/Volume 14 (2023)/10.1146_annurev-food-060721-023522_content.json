{"Abstract": "This study explores the development and characterization of novel colloidal food ingredients through the formation of protein complexes and conjugates with polysaccharides and polyphenols. The interaction between these biomolecules was investigated using advanced spectroscopic and microscopic techniques to elucidate the structural and functional properties of the complexes. The results demonstrate that the formation of protein-polysaccharide and protein-polyphenol conjugates significantly enhances the stability, solubility, and emulsifying properties of the colloidal systems. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of innovative food ingredients with improved functional attributes, contributing to the advancement of food science and technology. The potential applications of these complexes in food formulations, such as beverages, sauces, and emulsions, are discussed, highlighting their role in enhancing product quality and consumer acceptability."}
