{"Abstract": "Ferritin, a ubiquitous iron storage protein, exists in two primary forms: holo ferritin, which is saturated with iron, and apo ferritin, which is iron-free. This review explores the dual functionality of ferritin in both animal and plant systems, highlighting its potential in iron supplementation and as a delivery vehicle. Holo ferritin, rich in iron, is essential for addressing iron deficiency, a prevalent nutritional disorder. Conversely, apo ferritin's hollow structure and biocompatibility make it an ideal candidate for targeted drug delivery and nanotechnology applications. Studies in both animal and plant models demonstrate the efficacy of ferritin in enhancing iron bioavailability and as a versatile carrier for therapeutic agents. This dual role underscores the significance of ferritin in both nutritional and biomedical contexts, offering promising avenues for future research and application."}
