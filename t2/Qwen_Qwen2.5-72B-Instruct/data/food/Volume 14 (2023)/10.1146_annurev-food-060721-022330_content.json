{"Abstract": "This review explores the mechanisms, nanofabrication techniques, and potential applications of mechano-bactericidal surfaces in food processing and packaging. These surfaces, engineered to physically disrupt bacterial cell walls, offer a promising alternative to chemical antimicrobials. Advanced nanofabrication methods, such as lithography and etching, enable the creation of micro- and nano-scale topographies that enhance bactericidal efficiency. The integration of these surfaces into food-contact materials can significantly reduce microbial contamination, improving food safety and shelf life. Future prospects include optimizing surface designs and scaling up production for industrial use."}
