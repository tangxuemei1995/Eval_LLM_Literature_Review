{"Abstract": "This review focuses on the enzymatic production of nondigestible functional oligosaccharides and their applications in food to promote intestinal health. Functional oligosaccharides, recognized for their prebiotic effects, are increasingly being incorporated into food products to enhance gut microbiota and support overall health. The enzymatic synthesis of these oligosaccharides offers a sustainable and efficient method to produce a diverse range of prebiotics, including galacto-oligosaccharides, fructo-oligosaccharides, and xylo-oligosaccharides. The review discusses the enzymatic processes, including the selection of appropriate enzymes and substrates, and the optimization of reaction conditions to achieve high yields and purity. Additionally, the prebiotic effects of these oligosaccharides on the intestinal microbiota, such as the promotion of beneficial bacteria and the inhibition of pathogenic microorganisms, are highlighted. The potential of these functional oligosaccharides in various food applications, including dairy products, cereals, and beverages, is also explored, emphasizing their role in developing functional foods that support intestinal health."}
