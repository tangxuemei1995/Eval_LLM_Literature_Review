{"Abstract": "This comprehensive review explores the application of nanoparticles in food for oral delivery, focusing on their biological fate, evaluation models, and interactions with gut microbiota. Nanoparticles offer enhanced bioavailability and controlled release of bioactive compounds, but their safety and efficacy depend on understanding their behavior within the gastrointestinal tract. The review discusses various evaluation models, including in vitro and in vivo systems, to assess nanoparticle stability, absorption, and potential toxicity. Additionally, the influence of gut microbiota on nanoparticle fate and the reciprocal effects of nanoparticles on microbial communities are examined. This knowledge is crucial for developing safe and effective nanoparticle-based food products that can deliver health benefits while minimizing adverse effects."}
