{"Abstract": "Metabolic engineering and gene editing techniques have been employed to enhance the nutritional profile of edible plant oils. This study focuses on the development of oils with increased levels of high oleic acids, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), plant sterols, carotenoids, and vitamin E. Through targeted modifications in seed oil biosynthesis pathways, we have successfully produced oils with significantly improved nutritional qualities. These advancements not only enhance the health benefits of plant oils but also offer sustainable alternatives to traditional sources of essential nutrients."}
