{"Abstract": "The exploration of genebank collections for their metabolic signatures offers a promising yet underexploited avenue for enhancing human health. Genebanks, which house a vast array of plant genetic resources, represent a rich source of natural variance in phytonutrient profiles. These phytonutrients, including flavonoids, carotenoids, and polyphenols, play crucial roles in human nutrition and disease prevention. By leveraging advanced plant metabolomics techniques, researchers can identify and characterize novel phytonutrient variants that may possess enhanced health benefits. This approach not only aids in the development of more nutritious crop varieties but also provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the health-promoting effects of plant-based diets. Integrating these findings into public health strategies could lead to more effective dietary recommendations and the creation of functional foods tailored to specific health needs. Thus, genebank collections serve as a valuable resource for both agricultural and nutritional sciences, highlighting the potential for interdisciplinary collaboration to improve human health through plant-based interventions."}
