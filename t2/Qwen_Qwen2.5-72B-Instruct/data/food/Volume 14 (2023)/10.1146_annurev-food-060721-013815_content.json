{"Abstract": "This paper explores the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in enhancing food safety across the supply chain. By leveraging machine learning and computer vision, AI can detect contaminants and predict potential hazards with greater accuracy and speed than traditional methods. Machine learning algorithms can analyze vast datasets to identify patterns and anomalies, enabling predictive analytics that can forecast foodborne illness outbreaks and contamination risks. Additionally, computer vision technologies can inspect food products for physical and chemical contaminants, ensuring compliance with public health standards. The integration of these AI tools not only improves the efficiency and reliability of food safety monitoring but also enhances the overall resilience of the food supply chain, ultimately protecting consumer health and reducing economic losses."}
