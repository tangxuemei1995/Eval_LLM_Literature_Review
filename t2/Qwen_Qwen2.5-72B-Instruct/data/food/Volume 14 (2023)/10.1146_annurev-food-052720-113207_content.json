{"Abstract": "This review explores the application of microbubbles in food technology, emphasizing their role in enhancing sustainability, food safety, and security. Microbubbles, due to their unique properties such as high surface area and low buoyancy, offer innovative solutions in food processing, including improved mass transfer, enhanced cleaning and disinfection, and efficient ingredient delivery. Recent studies have demonstrated their effectiveness in reducing water and energy consumption, minimizing the use of chemical additives, and extending the shelf life of food products. The integration of microbubble technology in the production of novel foods also holds promise for developing healthier and more sustainable food options. This paper discusses the current state of research, potential applications, and future directions for microbubble technology in the food industry, highlighting its potential to address global food challenges."}
