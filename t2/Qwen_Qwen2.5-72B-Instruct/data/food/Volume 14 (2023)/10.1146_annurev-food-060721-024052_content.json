{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of mild fractionation techniques, including dry fractionation and mild wet separation, to enhance the sustainability and functionality of plant-based food ingredients. By optimizing these processes, the research aims to improve resource use efficiency and reduce environmental impacts associated with traditional food processing methods. The results indicate that mild fractionation can effectively isolate high-quality plant proteins while preserving their functional properties, such as solubility and emulsification. This approach not only minimizes energy consumption and water usage but also reduces waste generation, making it a promising strategy for the development of more sustainable food ingredients. The findings highlight the potential of mild fractionation to support the growing demand for plant-based products in a resource-efficient manner."}
