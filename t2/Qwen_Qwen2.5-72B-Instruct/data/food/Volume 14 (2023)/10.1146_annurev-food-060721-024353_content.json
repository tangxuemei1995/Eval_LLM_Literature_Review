{"Abstract": "The integration of biotechnology in the production of future food lipids presents a promising avenue for addressing global nutritional and sustainability challenges. This review highlights the opportunities and challenges associated with the use of microbial lipids, metabolic engineering, enzymatic modification, and the production of structural and phospholipids. Microbial lipids, derived from fungi, algae, and bacteria, offer a sustainable alternative to traditional plant and animal sources, with the potential for tailored fatty acid profiles. Metabolic engineering has enabled the optimization of microbial strains to enhance lipid yield and quality, while enzymatic modification techniques allow for the precise alteration of lipid structures to improve functional properties. However, scaling up production processes, ensuring cost-effectiveness, and meeting regulatory standards remain significant hurdles. The development of novel phospholipids and structural lipids through biotechnological approaches also holds promise for enhancing the nutritional value and stability of food products. This review discusses the current state of research, technological advancements, and future directions in the biotechnological production of food lipids."}
