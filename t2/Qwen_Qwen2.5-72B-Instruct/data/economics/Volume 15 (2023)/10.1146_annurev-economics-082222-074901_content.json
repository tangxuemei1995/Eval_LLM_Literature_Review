{"Abstract": "This study examines the impact of global risk shocks on non-bank financial intermediation and their implications for emerging market vulnerabilities. Using a comprehensive dataset of investment funds and international capital flows, we find that global risk shocks significantly affect the behavior of non-bank financial intermediaries, particularly investment funds, leading to increased capital outflows from emerging markets. The analysis reveals that benchmark investing practices exacerbate these outflows, as funds tend to rebalance their portfolios towards safer assets during periods of heightened global risk. This behavior amplifies tail risk in emerging markets, making them more susceptible to financial instability. The findings highlight the need for policymakers to consider the role of non-bank financial intermediaries in the transmission of global risk and to develop strategies to mitigate the associated vulnerabilities in emerging economies."}
