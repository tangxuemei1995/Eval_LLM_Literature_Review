{"Abstract": "This study examines the multifaceted impacts of USâ€“China trade relations, particularly focusing on the trade war and the 'China shock,' on US manufacturing employment through the lens of dynamic spatial economics and input-output linkages. By integrating comprehensive trade data with detailed employment statistics, the analysis reveals that while the initial surge in Chinese imports led to significant job losses in certain US manufacturing sectors, the subsequent trade war imposed additional costs on both countries. The research highlights the importance of input-output linkages, demonstrating that disruptions in supply chains exacerbated the negative effects on US manufacturing employment. Moreover, the study underscores the role of regional economic dynamics, showing that areas with more diversified economies and stronger innovation ecosystems were better able to adapt to the trade shocks. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers in crafting more resilient trade policies and supporting affected industries and workers."}
