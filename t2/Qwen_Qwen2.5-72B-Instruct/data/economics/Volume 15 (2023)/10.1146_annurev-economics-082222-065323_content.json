{"Abstract": "This study explores the econometric challenges and solutions associated with nonlinear budget sets, focusing on the random utility model and budget set regression. We analyze the phenomenon of bunching, where individuals cluster their choices at kinks or notches in the budget set, and discuss the use of instrumental variables to address endogeneity issues. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of consumer behavior under complex budget constraints and provide robust methods for empirical analysis."}
