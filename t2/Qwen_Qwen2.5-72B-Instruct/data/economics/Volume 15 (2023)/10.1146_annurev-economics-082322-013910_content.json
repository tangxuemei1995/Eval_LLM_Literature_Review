{"Abstract": "This paper provides a comprehensive overview of non-CES (Constant Elasticity of Substitution) aggregators, which are essential in modeling nonhomothetic preferences and CRS (Constant Returns to Scale) production functions. We explore the properties of implicit additivity and how it facilitates the aggregation of goods and services in economic models. The paper also delves into the concepts of gross substitutes and gross complements, highlighting their roles in determining the substitutability and complementarity of inputs. Additionally, we discuss the distinction between essential and inessential goods, and how these classifications impact the structure of demand and production functions. Through a guided tour of theoretical foundations and empirical applications, this paper aims to provide a clear understanding of the complexities and nuances of non-CES aggregators in modern economic analysis."}
