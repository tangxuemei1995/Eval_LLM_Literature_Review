{"Abstract": "This study explores the mechanisms of micro propagation and macro aggregation within production networks, focusing on how shocks at the micro level propagate through interconnected firms and industries, ultimately affecting aggregate productivity. By analyzing the role of misallocation in resource distribution, we identify key channels through which production disturbances are amplified or dampened across the economy. The findings suggest that the structure of production networks plays a crucial role in the comovement of economic activities, influencing the speed and extent of recovery from shocks. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the interdependencies within complex economic systems and provides insights for policy interventions aimed at enhancing resilience and productivity."}
