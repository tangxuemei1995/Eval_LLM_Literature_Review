{"Abstract": "This paper reviews recent advancements in the field of partial identification, focusing on methodologies that allow for the derivation of bounds on parameters of interest without requiring full specification of the underlying model. We discuss the application of shape restrictions and optimizing behavior to tighten these bounds, particularly in the context of treatment effects. The review highlights how these techniques can provide robust inferences in settings where traditional point identification is not feasible. Empirical illustrations are provided to demonstrate the practical utility of these methods in econometric analysis."}
