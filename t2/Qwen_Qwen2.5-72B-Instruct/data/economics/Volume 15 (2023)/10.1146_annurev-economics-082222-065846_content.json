{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of local projections (LPs) in the field of applied economics, offering a robust alternative to traditional vector autoregressions (VARs) for analyzing dynamic relationships in panel data. By leveraging the potential outcomes framework, LPs provide a flexible and transparent method for estimating causal effects, particularly in settings with heterogeneous treatment effects. The paper demonstrates the advantages of LPs through empirical examples, highlighting their ability to handle non-linearities and time-varying coefficients, making them a valuable tool for econometric analysis."}
