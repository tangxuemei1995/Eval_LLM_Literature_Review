{"Abstract": "This paper explores the economic dimensions of digital privacy, focusing on the role of data externalities and the effectiveness of privacy regulation. We analyze how the collection and use of personal data by digital platforms create externalities that affect both individual users and broader market dynamics. The study employs a game-theoretic model to illustrate the strategic interactions between users, platforms, and regulators, highlighting the challenges in aligning incentives for privacy protection. Empirical evidence from recent regulatory interventions, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union, is used to assess the impact of privacy policies on consumer welfare and market competition. The findings suggest that while regulation can mitigate some negative externalities, it also introduces new complexities and costs. The paper concludes with recommendations for a balanced regulatory approach that enhances digital privacy while fostering innovation and economic growth."}
