{"Abstract": "This paper provides a comprehensive review of China’s financial system and its impact on economic development. Since the initiation of economic reforms in 1978, China has undergone significant transformations, with the financial sector playing a pivotal role. The review highlights the evolution of financial markets, the role of state-owned banks, and the emergence of fintech. It also examines the concept of implicit guarantees, which have influenced risk perceptions and investment behaviors. Despite substantial progress, challenges remain, including the need for further market liberalization and regulatory reforms to enhance financial stability and efficiency. The paper concludes with an analysis of the implications of these developments for China’s continued economic growth and global financial integration."}
