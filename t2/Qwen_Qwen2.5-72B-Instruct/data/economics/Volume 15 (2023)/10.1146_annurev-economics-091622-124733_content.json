{"Abstract": "This study explores the cognitive limitations that lead to failures in contingent thinking, challenging the sure-thing principle. Through a series of behavioral experiments, we examine how individuals deviate from rational decision-making, providing insights into the psychological mechanisms underlying these cognitive biases. The findings contribute to the fields of cognitive economics and behavioral theory."}
