{"Abstract": "This paper examines the evolution and effectiveness of labor market insurance policies, particularly partial unemployment insurance, wage insurance, and short-time work schemes, in the twenty-first century. These policies are designed to mitigate the economic and social impacts of job loss and underemployment, especially in the context of rapid technological change and economic volatility. Using a combination of empirical analysis and case studies from various developed economies, the research evaluates the extent to which these policies have succeeded in stabilizing household incomes and reducing labor market frictions. The findings suggest that while partial unemployment insurance and short-time work programs have been effective in preserving jobs and smoothing income during economic downturns, wage insurance has shown mixed results, often benefiting higher-skilled workers more than those in low-skilled positions. The paper concludes with recommendations for policy design and implementation to enhance the inclusivity and responsiveness of labor market insurance in the face of ongoing economic challenges."}
