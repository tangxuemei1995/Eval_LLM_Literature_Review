{"Abstract": "Tropical deforestation is a critical environmental issue with profound implications for climate change, biodiversity loss, and natural resource management. This study integrates insights from environmental economics and political economy to analyze the drivers and economic impacts of tropical deforestation. Using a combination of remote sensing data and econometric models, we examine the role of externalities, common-property resources, and land use change in driving deforestation. Our findings highlight the significant economic costs associated with deforestation, including reduced carbon sequestration, loss of ecosystem services, and diminished agricultural productivity. We also explore the effectiveness of various policy interventions, such as payments for ecosystem services and community-based management, in mitigating deforestation. The analysis underscores the need for a multifaceted approach that addresses both the economic incentives and governance challenges associated with tropical deforestation. This research contributes to the broader understanding of the complex interplay between economic activities and environmental degradation in tropical regions."}
