{"Abstract": "This study explores the organizational structures and governance mechanisms of social enterprises, including nonprofits and public benefit corporations. By analyzing a diverse sample of social enterprises, the research identifies key factors that contribute to their effectiveness in achieving social missions while maintaining financial sustainability. The findings highlight the importance of hybrid organizational models that integrate elements of traditional for-profit and nonprofit structures. These models enable social enterprises to leverage resources and partnerships more effectively, fostering innovation and resilience. The study also underscores the role of stakeholder engagement and transparent governance practices in building trust and accountability. Implications for policymakers and practitioners are discussed, emphasizing the need for supportive regulatory frameworks and capacity-building initiatives to enhance the impact of social enterprises."}
