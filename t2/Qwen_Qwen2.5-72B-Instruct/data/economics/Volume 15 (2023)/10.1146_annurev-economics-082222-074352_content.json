{"Abstract": "This paper explores the application of advanced text algorithms, including topic models, word embeddings, and transformer models, in the field of economics. By treating text as data, these algorithms enable the extraction of meaningful insights from large volumes of textual information, enhancing our understanding of economic phenomena. The integration of large language models further amplifies the potential for analyzing complex economic narratives and patterns, offering new avenues for research and policy-making."}
