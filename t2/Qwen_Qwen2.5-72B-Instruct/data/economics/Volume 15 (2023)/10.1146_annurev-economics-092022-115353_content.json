{"Abstract": "This study examines the effectiveness of various interventions aimed at reducing gender disparities in negotiation outcomes. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature, we analyze the impact of negotiation training, salary history bans, and increased transparency in the bargaining process. Our findings suggest that while negotiation training can empower women to adopt more assertive strategies, it is not sufficient on its own to close the gender gap. Salary history bans and increased transparency, however, show promising results in leveling the playing field by mitigating the influence of past salary disparities and fostering more equitable negotiations. These interventions, when implemented in conjunction, can significantly reduce the gender gap in negotiation outcomes, promoting fairness and equality in the workplace."}
