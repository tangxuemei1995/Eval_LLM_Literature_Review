{"Abstract": "This study examines the impact of corporate taxation on multinational companies, particularly during economic crises. It explores how tax incidence affects corporate behavior and financial performance. Using a comprehensive dataset of multinational firms, the research identifies significant variations in tax strategies and their economic outcomes. The findings suggest that during crises, companies with more flexible tax structures are better positioned to mitigate financial losses and maintain operational stability."}
