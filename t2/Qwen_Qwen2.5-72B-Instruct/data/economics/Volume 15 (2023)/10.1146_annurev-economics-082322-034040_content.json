{"Abstract": "This paper examines the economic rationale and potential impacts of implementing border carbon adjustments (BCAs) as a policy tool to address carbon leakage and support global climate action. BCAs, often referred to as carbon tariffs, aim to level the playing field between domestic and foreign producers by adjusting the carbon price of imported goods to match domestic carbon pricing policies. The analysis reveals that BCAs can effectively prevent carbon leakage, where industries relocate to countries with less stringent environmental regulations, thereby undermining the effectiveness of domestic climate policies. However, the paper also highlights the potential trade-offs, including the risk of trade disputes and the complexity of accurately measuring and applying carbon content to imported goods. Furthermore, the concept of a 'climate club' is explored, where countries with similar climate ambitions collaborate to implement BCAs, enhancing their collective bargaining power and promoting a more coordinated global response to climate change. The findings suggest that while BCAs are a promising policy instrument, their design and implementation must be carefully considered to maximize benefits and minimize adverse effects."}
