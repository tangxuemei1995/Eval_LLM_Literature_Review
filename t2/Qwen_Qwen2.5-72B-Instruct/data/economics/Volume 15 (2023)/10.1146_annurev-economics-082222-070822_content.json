{"Abstract": "This paper examines the economic implications of antitrust reform, focusing on the balance between fostering competition and preventing monopolistic practices. By analyzing recent trends in mergers and acquisitions, the study highlights the need for updated regulatory frameworks that address the complexities of modern market structures. The research employs a combination of theoretical models and empirical data to assess the impact of current antitrust policies on market dynamics, consumer welfare, and innovation. Key findings suggest that while existing regulations have curbed some anticompetitive behaviors, they fall short in addressing emerging challenges, particularly in digital and tech sectors. The paper concludes with recommendations for targeted reforms that enhance competition without stifling economic growth and innovation."}
