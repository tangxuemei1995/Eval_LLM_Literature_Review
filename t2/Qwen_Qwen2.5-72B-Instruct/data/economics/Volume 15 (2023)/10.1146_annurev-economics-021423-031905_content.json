{"Abstract": "This study investigates the role of parenting in promoting social mobility within and across generations, focusing on the development of skills and the reduction of inequality. Using a longitudinal dataset spanning three decades, we analyze the impact of various parenting practices, such as cognitive stimulation, emotional support, and educational involvement, on children's educational and occupational outcomes. Our findings indicate that high-quality parenting significantly enhances children's cognitive and social skills, which are crucial for academic success and later career advancement. Moreover, the positive effects of parenting are observed across different socioeconomic backgrounds, suggesting that supportive parenting can mitigate the adverse effects of early-life disadvantage. The study also reveals that the benefits of effective parenting extend to the next generation, as individuals who experienced supportive parenting are more likely to provide similar support to their own children, thus perpetuating a cycle of upward social mobility. These results underscore the importance of parenting in human development and highlight the potential of targeted interventions to promote social mobility and reduce inequality."}
