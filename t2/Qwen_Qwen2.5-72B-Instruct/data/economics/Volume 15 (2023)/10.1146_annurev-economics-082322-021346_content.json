{"Abstract": "This paper explores the integration of new perspectives within Austrian economics, particularly in the realms of behavioral economics, development economics, and robust political economy. It examines how these insights can enhance our understanding of entrepreneurship, governance, and social economy, while also addressing contemporary challenges such as infectious diseases, natural disasters, and war. By synthesizing these interdisciplinary approaches, the paper aims to provide a more comprehensive framework for analyzing economic phenomena and policy responses."}
