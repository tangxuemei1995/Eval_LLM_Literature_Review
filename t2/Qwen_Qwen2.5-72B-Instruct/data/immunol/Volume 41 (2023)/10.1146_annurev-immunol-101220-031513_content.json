{"Abstract": "Systems immunology approaches are increasingly being applied to unravel the complex interplay between immune responses and metabolic processes. By integrating high-throughput data from transcriptomics, metabolomics, and metabolic imaging, these methods offer a comprehensive view of immunometabolism. Computational biology tools enable the modeling of dynamic interactions within immune cells, revealing how metabolic pathways influence immune function and vice versa. This review highlights recent advances in using systems immunology to understand the regulatory networks that govern immune cell metabolism, with implications for therapeutic interventions in metabolic disorders and immune-related diseases."}
