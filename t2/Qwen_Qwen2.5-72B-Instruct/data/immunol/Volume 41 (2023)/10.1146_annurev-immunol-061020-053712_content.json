{"Abstract": "Immunoglobulin E (IgE) plays a pivotal role in allergic responses and is characterized by its unique structure and interactions with FcεRI and CD23 receptors. This review elucidates the molecular architecture of IgE, focusing on the constant and variable regions that confer its specificity and effector functions. The FcεRI, a high-affinity receptor, is primarily expressed on mast cells and basophils, mediating immediate hypersensitivity reactions. CD23, a low-affinity receptor, is involved in the presentation of allergens and the regulation of IgE production. Recent advances in biologics, such as omalizumab, target the Fc region of IgE, blocking its binding to FcεRI and CD23, thereby reducing allergic inflammation. The mechanisms of action of these anti-IgE biologics involve allosteric modulation, which alters the conformation of IgE and its receptors, disrupting downstream signaling pathways. Understanding these intricate interactions provides insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies for allergic diseases."}
