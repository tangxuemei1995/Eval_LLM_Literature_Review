{"Abstract": "RNA modifications, particularly N6-methyladenosine (m6A), play crucial roles in the regulation of immune responses. These modifications influence the epitranscriptome, affecting gene expression and RNA stability. In antiviral immunity, m6A modifications enhance the recognition and clearance of viral pathogens. In antitumor immunity, RNA modifications modulate the tumor microenvironment, influencing the activation and function of immune cells. Understanding these mechanisms provides insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies for immune-related diseases."}
