{"Abstract": "Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and Interleukin-13 (IL-13) are key cytokines in type 2 immune responses, playing critical roles in wound repair and tissue homeostasis. These cytokines modulate inflammation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, essential processes for effective wound healing. Both IL-4 and IL-13 activate signaling pathways that enhance fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis, promoting ECM deposition and tissue integrity. Additionally, they regulate the recruitment and activation of immune cells, such as macrophages and eosinophils, which contribute to the resolution of inflammation and the promotion of tissue repair. Studies in helminth infections and models of tissue injury have highlighted the dual role of these cytokines in both protecting against pathogens and facilitating wound healing. However, dysregulated IL-4 and IL-13 signaling can lead to excessive fibrosis and impaired wound healing, underscoring the delicate balance required for optimal tissue repair."}
