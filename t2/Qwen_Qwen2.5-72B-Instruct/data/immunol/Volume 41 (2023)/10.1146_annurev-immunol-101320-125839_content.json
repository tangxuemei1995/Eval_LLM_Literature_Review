{"Abstract": "Inflammatory anemia is a common condition characterized by reduced erythropoiesis and impaired iron metabolism, often associated with chronic infections, autoimmune diseases, and malignancies. This review explores the intricate immune mechanisms underlying inflammatory anemia, focusing on the roles of hemophagocytes and their activation in conditions such as malaria and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Hemophagocytes, primarily macrophages, engulf and degrade erythrocytes and their precursors, contributing to anemia. In malaria, parasitic infection triggers an inflammatory response that activates hemophagocytes, leading to excessive erythrophagocytosis. Similarly, in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, uncontrolled activation of the immune system results in widespread hemophagocytosis and severe anemia. In sickle cell anemia, chronic inflammation exacerbates hemolysis and erythroid stress, further complicating anemia. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted therapies to modulate immune responses and improve outcomes in patients with inflammatory anemia."}
