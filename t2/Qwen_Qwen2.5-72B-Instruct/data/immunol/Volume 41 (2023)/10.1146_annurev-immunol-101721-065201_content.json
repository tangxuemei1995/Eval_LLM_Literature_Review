{"Abstract": "The field of immunology has long relied on mouse models to understand human immune responses, yet significant discrepancies exist between mouse and human immunological processes. This review explores the genetic underpinnings of these differences, focusing on inborn errors of immunity and genetic susceptibility to infectious diseases. By integrating insights from human genetics with mouse genetics, we highlight key genetic variants that influence immune function and disease susceptibility in both species. Recent advances in genome editing and single-cell genomics have facilitated the identification of conserved and divergent pathways, providing a more nuanced understanding of how genetic variations shape immune responses. This reconciliation of mouse and human immunology through genetics not only enhances our comprehension of immunodeficiency and infectious diseases but also paves the way for more effective translational research and personalized medicine approaches."}
