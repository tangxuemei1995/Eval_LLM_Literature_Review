{"Abstract": "Endogenous retroelements (EREs), remnants of ancient viral infections, are deeply embedded within the human genome. These elements, including endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), have evolved to coexist with their hosts, often remaining dormant. However, under certain conditions, such as inflammation or cellular stress, EREs can become active, leading to the production of viral-like particles and the expression of retroviral proteins. This activation triggers a complex immunological response, involving both innate and adaptive immunity. The innate immune system, particularly the interferon response, plays a crucial role in recognizing and suppressing ERE activity, while the adaptive immune system may generate specific antibodies and T-cell responses against ERE-derived antigens. Paradoxically, while the immune system aims to control ERE expression, chronic activation of these elements can contribute to autoimmune diseases and cancer. Understanding the intricate balance between EREs and the immune system is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to modulate their activity and mitigate associated pathologies."}
