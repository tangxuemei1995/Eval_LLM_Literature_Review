{"Abstract": "Effector-Triggered Immunity (ETI) is a sophisticated defense mechanism in plants that recognizes specific pathogen-derived effector proteins, distinguishing it from the more general Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI). ETI is activated when plant resistance (R) proteins, often nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins, directly or indirectly detect the presence of pathogen effectors. This recognition triggers a robust immune response, including localized cell death, the production of reactive oxygen species, and the upregulation of defense-related genes. Recent studies have revealed that ETI can also involve the concept of 'guard immunity,' where R proteins monitor the integrity of host targets that are manipulated by pathogen effectors. This intricate surveillance system ensures that even subtle virulence strategies are countered, providing a layered defense against a wide range of pathogens. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of ETI is crucial for developing strategies to enhance plant resistance in agricultural settings."}
