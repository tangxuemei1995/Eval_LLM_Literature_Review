{"Abstract": "This study investigates the T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2, focusing on the impact of viral variants, infection, and vaccination on disease severity. By analyzing epitope-specific T cell responses in a cohort of individuals with varying exposure to SARS-CoV-2, we found that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play crucial roles in controlling viral replication and modulating disease outcomes. Our results indicate that T cell responses are generally robust across different variants, although some mutations can affect epitope recognition. Vaccination was associated with enhanced T cell responses, which correlated with reduced disease severity. These findings underscore the importance of T cell immunity in the context of evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants and highlight the potential for T cell-based strategies in vaccine development and therapeutic interventions."}
