{"Abstract": "The complement system, traditionally recognized for its role in immune defense, has emerged as a critical player in brain function and pathology. Specifically, C1q, the initiating protein of the classical complement pathway, is involved in synaptic pruning, a process essential for neuronal plasticity and circuit refinement. Recent studies highlight the dual role of complement in neuroprotection and neuroinflammation, with microglia serving as key effectors. In neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease, dysregulated complement activation contributes to excessive synaptic loss and chronic inflammation, exacerbating disease progression. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the mechanisms by which complement mediates neuroprotection, neuronal plasticity, and neuroinflammation, and discusses the therapeutic potential of targeting complement pathways to mitigate neurodegenerative processes."}
