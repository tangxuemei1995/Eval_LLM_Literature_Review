{"Abstract": "The severity of COVID-19 pneumonia is influenced by the host's immune response, particularly the type I interferon (IFN) pathway. Recent studies have identified that a significant proportion of critically ill patients with COVID-19 possess anticytokine autoantibodies that neutralize type I IFNs, leading to impaired antiviral defense and exacerbated inflammatory responses. Genetic variations affecting IFN production and signaling also contribute to the dysregulated immune response observed in severe cases. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the role of type I IFNs in SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting the mechanisms by which autoantibodies and genetic factors interfere with IFN function. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic strategies to modulate the immune response and improve outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia."}
