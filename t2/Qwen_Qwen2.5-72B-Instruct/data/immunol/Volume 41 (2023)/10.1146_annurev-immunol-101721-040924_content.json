{"Abstract": "This study employs mathematical modeling to elucidate the mechanisms of T cell fate determination, focusing on the dynamic interplay between environmental cues and intracellular signaling pathways. By integrating experimental data with computational simulations, we explore how varying concentrations of cytokines and antigen presentation influence the differentiation of naive T cells into effector and memory subsets. Our model predicts critical thresholds for cytokine exposure that dictate T cell fate, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets for immune modulation. The findings enhance our understanding of T cell biology and offer a framework for predicting immune responses in diverse contexts."}
