{"Abstract": "Natural Killer (NK) cells are a critical component of the immune system, particularly in the uterine mucosa during early pregnancy. This review focuses on the role of uterine NK (uNK) cells in the decidua, the specialized endometrium that forms during pregnancy. uNK cells are the predominant leukocytes in the early gestational decidua and play a crucial role in the regulation of trophoblast invasion and vascular remodeling. Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between uNK cells and trophoblasts, suggesting that uNK cells modulate trophoblast function through both direct contact and cytokine secretion. Dysregulation of uNK cell activity has been implicated in various reproductive disorders, including recurrent miscarriage and preeclampsia. Understanding the mechanisms by which uNK cells contribute to a successful pregnancy may provide new therapeutic targets for improving reproductive outcomes."}
