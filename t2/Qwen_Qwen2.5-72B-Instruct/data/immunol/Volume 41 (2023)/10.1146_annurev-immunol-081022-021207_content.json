{"Abstract": "The NLRP3 inflammasome plays a critical role in innate immunity by assembling a multiprotein complex that activates caspase-1, leading to the maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1Î² and IL-18. Recent structural studies have elucidated the mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation. The NLRP3 protein, upon activation, oligomerizes and recruits the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), which forms filamentous structures. These ASC filaments serve as a scaffold for the recruitment and activation of pro-caspase-1, facilitating its autocatalytic cleavage into active caspase-1. High-resolution cryo-EM structures have revealed the intricate details of these interactions, including the specific domains involved in NLRP3-ASC and ASC-caspase-1 binding. Understanding these structural mechanisms provides insights into the regulation of inflammasome activity and potential therapeutic targets for inflammatory diseases."}
