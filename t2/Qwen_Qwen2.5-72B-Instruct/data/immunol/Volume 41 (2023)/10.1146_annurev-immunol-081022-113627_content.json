{"Abstract": "Tissue myeloid cells, including macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils, play critical roles in immune responses and tissue homeostasis. These cells originate from granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) and exhibit significant heterogeneity in their functions and phenotypes across different tissues. Recent advances in fate-mapping and single-cell transcriptomics have elucidated the distinct developmental pathways and niches that influence the differentiation and function of GMP-derived cells. This review highlights the current understanding of the origin and heterogeneity of tissue myeloid cells, emphasizing the role of GMPs in generating monocytes and neutrophils. We discuss how tissue-specific microenvironments and reprogramming events contribute to the diversity of myeloid cell functions, providing insights into their roles in health and disease."}
