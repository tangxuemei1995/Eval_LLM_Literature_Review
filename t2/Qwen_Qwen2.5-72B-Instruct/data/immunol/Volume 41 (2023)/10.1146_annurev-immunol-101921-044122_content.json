{"Abstract": "Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach to harness the immune system's ability to recognize and eliminate tumor cells. This study focuses on the design of novel immunotherapies that simultaneously engage T cells and natural killer (NK) cells to enhance antitumor responses. By utilizing bispecific antibodies and engineered cytokines, we aim to bridge the gap between these two critical components of the immune system. Our results demonstrate that the combination of T cell and NK cell activation leads to a synergistic effect, resulting in more effective tumor cell lysis and a reduction in tumor burden in preclinical models. Furthermore, the therapy shows potential for overcoming resistance mechanisms often observed in monotherapies. These findings provide a strong rationale for the clinical development of dual-targeting immunotherapies to improve outcomes for cancer patients."}
