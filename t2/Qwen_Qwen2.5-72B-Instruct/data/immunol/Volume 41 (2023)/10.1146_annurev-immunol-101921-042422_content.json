{"Abstract": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disorder characterized by chronic inflammation and the production of autoantibodies. While the pathogenesis of SLE is multifaceted, recent studies have highlighted the pivotal role of interferons (IFNs) in disease progression. IFNs, particularly type I IFNs, are overexpressed in SLE patients and contribute to the activation of immune cells, leading to increased production of autoantibodies and systemic inflammation. However, the pathogenesis of SLE extends beyond the interferon pathway. Cell death, particularly necroptosis and apoptosis, plays a critical role in the release of self-antigens, which can be recognized by the immune system, leading to the formation of immune complexes. Mitochondrial dysfunction has also emerged as a significant factor, as damaged mitochondria can release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that exacerbate inflammation. Additionally, the extrafollicular activation of B cells, which occurs outside of germinal centers, contributes to the rapid production of autoantibodies and the perpetuation of the autoimmune response. This review integrates these key aspects of SLE pathogenesis, emphasizing the interplay between interferon signaling, cell death, mitochondrial dysfunction, and B cell activation, and highlights potential therapeutic targets for intervention."}
