{"Abstract": "Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of T cell function, influencing the development, differentiation, and activation of various T cell subsets. In CD4+ T helper cells, TGF-β promotes the generation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) while inhibiting the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity. In CD8+ T cells, TGF-β can induce anergy or promote the development of memory T cells, depending on the context. TGF-β also modulates the function of innate lymphoid cells, intraepithelial lymphocytes, and γδ T cells, contributing to mucosal immunity and tissue repair. Additionally, TGF-β is crucial for maintaining T cell quiescence and can inhibit T cell activation, thus preventing excessive immune responses. Understanding the complex interplay between TGF-β and T cell subsets is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to modulate immune responses in various diseases."}
