{"Abstract": "The field of biomaterials-mediated engineering of the immune system has emerged as a promising approach to enhance immunotherapy and vaccine efficacy. This review highlights recent advancements in the design and application of biomaterials, particularly nanoparticles, as vaccine adjuvants and immunomodulatory agents. These materials can be tailored to control the release of antigens, modulate immune responses, and target specific immune cells, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes. Studies have demonstrated the potential of biomaterials to enhance the potency and specificity of vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer. Additionally, the use of biomaterials in combination with immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, has shown synergistic effects in preclinical models. The future of this field lies in the development of personalized and multifunctional biomaterials that can address the complex and diverse nature of immune responses."}
