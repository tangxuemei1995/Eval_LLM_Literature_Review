{"Abstract": "Aging is associated with a decline in immune function, a phenomenon known as immunosenescence, which is characterized by the accumulation of highly differentiated T cell subsets. These subsets, marked by altered phenotypes and functions, contribute to chronic inflammation and tissue deterioration. Thymus involution, a hallmark of aging, reduces the output of na√Øve T cells, leading to an expansion of memory and effector T cells. This shift in the T cell repertoire exacerbates senescence and inflammation, impacting various tissues. Recent studies have identified specific T cell subsets, such as senescence-associated T cells, that play a pivotal role in age-related tissue damage. Understanding the mechanisms by which these subsets contribute to tissue deterioration may provide new therapeutic targets for mitigating the effects of aging."}
