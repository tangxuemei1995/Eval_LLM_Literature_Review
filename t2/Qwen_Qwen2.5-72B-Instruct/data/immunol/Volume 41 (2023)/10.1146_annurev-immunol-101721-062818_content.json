{"Abstract": "The intricate dialogue between immune cells and epithelial tissues plays a pivotal role in the processes of regeneration and repair. This cross talk is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis and responding to injury or infection. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of immune mediators in modulating the behavior of epithelial stem cells, which are crucial for tissue regeneration. Inflammatory signals can both promote and inhibit repair, depending on the context and the specific immune cells involved. For instance, macrophages and T cells can secrete factors that enhance stem cell proliferation and differentiation, while excessive inflammation can lead to chronic tissue damage and fibrosis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this interaction is critical for developing therapeutic strategies to enhance tissue repair and prevent inflammatory diseases. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the immune-epithelial cross talk, emphasizing its implications for regenerative medicine and the treatment of inflammatory disorders."}
