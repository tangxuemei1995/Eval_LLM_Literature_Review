{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical role of data in managing public health crises, yet it has also exposed significant gaps in data governance frameworks. This study examines the challenges and opportunities in leveraging data, particularly through artificial intelligence (AI) and contact tracing technologies, while ensuring privacy and trust. By analyzing existing data governance models and their application during the pandemic, the research highlights the need for a robust, privacy-by-design approach. The findings suggest that integrating ethical considerations and transparent data practices can enhance public trust and the effectiveness of AI-driven solutions in pandemic response. The implications of this study are crucial for policymakers and technologists aiming to balance innovation with individual privacy rights."}
