{"Abstract": "This study examines the intersection of race and low-wage immigrant labor, highlighting how racialized structures and practices perpetuate inequality and exploitation in the workforce. By centering race in the analysis, the research reveals how systemic racism intersects with immigration policies to marginalize and devalue immigrant workers. The findings underscore the need for a more nuanced understanding of the racial dimensions of labor, advocating for policies that address both racial and economic justice. Through a combination of qualitative interviews and quantitative data analysis, the study provides evidence of the pervasive impact of racism on immigrant workers' experiences and rights, calling for comprehensive reforms to protect vulnerable populations and promote equitable working conditions."}
