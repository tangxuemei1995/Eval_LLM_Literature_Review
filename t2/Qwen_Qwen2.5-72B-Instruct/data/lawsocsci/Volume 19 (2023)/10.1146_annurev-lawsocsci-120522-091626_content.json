{"Abstract": "This paper explores the challenges and opportunities in regulating artificial intelligence (AI) within government contexts, focusing on the sociotechnical dimensions of institutional design. As governments increasingly adopt AI to enhance decision-making and service delivery, the need for robust regulatory frameworks becomes paramount. The paper examines how public administration can navigate the complexities of AI, ensuring that technological advancements align with ethical, legal, and social standards. Through a review of existing literature and case studies, the research highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, stakeholder engagement, and adaptive governance mechanisms. It argues that effective regulation of government AI requires a nuanced understanding of both technical and social factors, emphasizing the role of institutional design in fostering transparency, accountability, and public trust. The findings suggest that a flexible, participatory approach to regulation can better address the dynamic nature of AI technologies and their impact on public administration."}
