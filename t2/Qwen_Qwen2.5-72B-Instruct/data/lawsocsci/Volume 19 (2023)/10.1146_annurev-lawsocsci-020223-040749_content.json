{"Abstract": "This paper explores the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and global governance, focusing on the modalities, rationales, and tensions that arise from the integration of AI into international regulatory frameworks. As AI technologies, including machine learning algorithms, become increasingly pervasive, they present both opportunities and challenges for global governance. The paper examines how algorithmic regulation can enhance efficiency and transparency in governance processes, while also highlighting the risks associated with bias, accountability, and the potential for exacerbating global inequalities. Through a review of existing literature and case studies, the research identifies key tensions between the need for robust AI regulation and the sovereignty of nations, as well as the ethical implications of delegating decision-making to automated systems. The findings suggest that a balanced approach, combining international cooperation with localized governance strategies, is essential for harnessing the benefits of AI while mitigating its risks."}
