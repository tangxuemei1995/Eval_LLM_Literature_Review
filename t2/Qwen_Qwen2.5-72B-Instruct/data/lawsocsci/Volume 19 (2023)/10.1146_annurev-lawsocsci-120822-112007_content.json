{"Abstract": "This study examines the impact of mandatory employment arbitration on access to justice and the resolution of employment disputes. Through a comprehensive review of legal literature and empirical data, the research highlights the advantages and disadvantages of mandatory arbitration as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism. Key findings indicate that while mandatory arbitration can expedite the resolution process and reduce costs, it may also limit employees' access to judicial remedies and exacerbate power imbalances. The study further explores the implications for employment law and recommends policy reforms to enhance fairness and transparency in the arbitration process. These findings contribute to ongoing debates about the role of mandatory arbitration in the modern workplace and its alignment with principles of justice and equity."}
