{"Abstract": "This study examines the interplay between authoritarian legality and state capitalism in contemporary China, focusing on the dual state structure that balances formal legal institutions with informal political mechanisms. The research highlights how the Chinese state has managed to foster economic growth and market development while maintaining tight political control. By analyzing property rights, land, and labor markets, the study reveals that the rule of law in China is selectively applied to support state objectives and protect state-owned enterprises. The dual state framework allows for the coexistence of market mechanisms and authoritarian governance, creating a unique model of state capitalism. This model has implications for understanding the role of legal institutions in non-democratic settings and the potential for economic development under authoritarian regimes."}
