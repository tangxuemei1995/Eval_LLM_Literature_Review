{"Abstract": "This paper examines the enduring legacy of the Guantánamo Bay detention facility, focusing on its impact on the rule of law, human rights, and the legal framework governing the treatment of detainees. Since its establishment in 2002, Guantánamo has been a focal point for debates on torture, the use of CIA black sites, and the legitimacy of military commissions. The paper analyzes key Supreme Court decisions, such as Rasul v. Bush and Boumediene v. Bush, which affirmed the right of habeas corpus for detainees. It also explores the implications of these rulings on the broader discourse of war crimes and the ethical responsibilities of democratic nations. The study concludes that while Guantánamo remains open, its legacy continues to challenge the balance between national security and the protection of fundamental human rights."}
