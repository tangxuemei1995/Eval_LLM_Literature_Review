{"Abstract": "This study explores the extent to which technology, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), is transforming law firms and the broader legal profession. Drawing on a comprehensive review of recent literature and case studies from leading law firms, the research examines the integration of AI tools in legal practice, including document review, contract analysis, and predictive analytics. The findings suggest that while AI has the potential to enhance efficiency and accuracy, its impact on the organizational structure and workflow of law firms is more nuanced. The concept of organizational complementarity is introduced to explain how law firms are adapting to new technologies by redefining roles and processes to leverage human expertise alongside AI capabilities. The study concludes that the transformation of law firms is an ongoing process, with significant variations in adoption and impact across different firms and practice areas."}
