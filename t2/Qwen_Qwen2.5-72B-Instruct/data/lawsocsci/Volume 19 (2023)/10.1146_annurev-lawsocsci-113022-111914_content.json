{"Abstract": "This study examines the role of police officers as witnesses and defendants in legal proceedings, focusing on issues of police accountability and the implications for law enforcement. Through a comprehensive review of case law and legal literature, the research highlights the challenges and complexities surrounding police testimony, including the prevalence of perjury and the withholding of Brady evidence. The study also explores the doctrine of qualified immunity and its impact on the prosecution of police misconduct. Findings suggest that while police officers are often afforded significant legal protections, these protections can sometimes undermine the pursuit of justice and accountability. Recommendations for reform include enhanced training on ethical testimony, stricter enforcement of disclosure obligations, and a reevaluation of qualified immunity to better balance the interests of law enforcement and the public."}
