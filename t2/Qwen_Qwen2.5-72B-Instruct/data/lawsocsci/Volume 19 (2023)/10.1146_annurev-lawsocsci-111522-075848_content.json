{"Abstract": "This paper explores the phenomenon of refeudalization in contemporary legal systems, marking a shift from the rule of law towards a system characterized by ties of allegiance. It examines how the erosion of traditional democratic institutions and the rise of contractualization in governance have led to a reconfiguration of sovereignty and representation. Through a comparative analysis of various legal frameworks, the study highlights the ways in which modern legal practices are increasingly resembling feudal structures, where personal loyalty and patronage play a pivotal role. The implications of this shift for democratic accountability and the protection of individual rights are critically assessed, suggesting that refeudalization poses significant challenges to the foundational principles of modern legal and political systems."}
