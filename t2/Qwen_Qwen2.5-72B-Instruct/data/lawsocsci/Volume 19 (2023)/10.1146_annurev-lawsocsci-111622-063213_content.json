{"Abstract": "This study explores the role of laws and policies in shaping social cognition, particularly in the context of intergroup relations and implicit bias. By examining the impact of desegregation policies and anti-discrimination laws, we investigate how these interventions can either mitigate or exacerbate cognitive biases. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach that integrates psychology and law, we analyze empirical data from various social settings, including education and employment. Our findings suggest that while certain policies effectively reduce implicit biases and improve intergroup relations, others may inadvertently reinforce existing cognitive barriers. This research highlights the importance of carefully designed social interventions to promote equitable outcomes and foster more inclusive societies."}
