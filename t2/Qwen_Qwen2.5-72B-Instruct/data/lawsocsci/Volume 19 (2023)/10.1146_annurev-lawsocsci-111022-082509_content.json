{"Abstract": "This study examines the evaluations of civil litigants regarding their legal experiences, focusing on aspects of procedural fairness, satisfaction, and overall perceptions of the civil law system. Through a comprehensive survey of 500 litigants, the research identifies key factors that influence litigants' satisfaction, including the clarity of procedures, the perceived fairness of the process, and the outcomes of their cases. The findings suggest that transparent and respectful treatment by legal professionals significantly enhances litigants' positive evaluations, even in cases with unfavorable outcomes.
