{"Abstract": "This paper explores the methodologies and frameworks necessary for studying global lawmaking, particularly focusing on the domains of intellectual property rights and international health emergencies. By critiquing methodological nationalism, the research highlights the importance of a transnational approach to understanding how global legal norms are shaped and implemented. The analysis draws on case studies of international agreements, such as the TRIPS Agreement and the WHOâ€™s International Health Regulations, to illustrate the complex interplay between state and non-state actors in the global legal landscape. The findings suggest that effective global lawmaking requires a nuanced understanding of the diverse interests and power dynamics at play, and the paper offers recommendations for future research to bridge the gap between theoretical frameworks and practical applications in global governance."}
