{"Abstract": "Medical aid in dying (MAD), a practice that allows terminally ill patients to request and self-administer lethal medication, has emerged as a contentious issue at the intersection of medicine, law, and culture. This paper explores the evolving landscape of MAD, examining its legal, ethical, and social dimensions. Through a comprehensive review of recent legislation, case studies, and public opinion data, we highlight the growing support for MAD as a means to provide autonomy and dignity to those facing end-of-life decisions. The analysis also addresses the ethical debates surrounding assisted suicide and euthanasia, including concerns about patient coercion, the role of healthcare providers, and the potential for misuse. Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of social movements advocating for the right to die, which have played a crucial role in shaping public discourse and policy. As MAD continues to gain traction, this study underscores the need for balanced, evidence-based approaches to ensure that the rights and well-being of all stakeholders are protected."}
