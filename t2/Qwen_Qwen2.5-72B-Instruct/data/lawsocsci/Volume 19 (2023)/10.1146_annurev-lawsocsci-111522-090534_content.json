{"Abstract": "This paper explores the multifaceted role of vaccines in public health through an interdisciplinary lens, integrating sociolegal studies and science and technology studies (STS). By examining the social, legal, and technological dimensions of vaccine development, distribution, and acceptance, the study highlights the complex interplay between scientific innovation and societal norms. Ethnographic methods are employed to uncover the lived experiences of stakeholders, including healthcare providers, policymakers, and community members, revealing the nuanced challenges and successes in vaccine programs. The analysis underscores the importance of considering legal frameworks and social contexts in the design and implementation of public health interventions, suggesting that a more holistic approach can enhance vaccine uptake and public trust. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of how law and science intersect in the realm of public health, offering insights for more effective and equitable vaccine policies."}
