{"Abstract": "This paper explores the complexities and uncertainties within bankruptcy law, particularly focusing on Chapter 11 proceedings. It examines the known frameworks and outcomes of corporate reorganization, while also highlighting the less understood aspects such as the long-term impacts on stakeholders and the economy. Through a review of recent case studies and legal literature, the paper identifies gaps in current research and suggests areas for future investigation, including the role of bankruptcy law in fostering corporate innovation and the effectiveness of debtor-in-possession financing. The analysis underscores the need for a more nuanced understanding of how bankruptcy laws can be optimized to balance the interests of creditors and debtors."}
