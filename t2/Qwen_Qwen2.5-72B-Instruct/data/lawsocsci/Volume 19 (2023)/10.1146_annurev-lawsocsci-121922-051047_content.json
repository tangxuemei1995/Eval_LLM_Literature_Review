{"Abstract": "This paper explores the intersection of social reproduction, unpaid and domestic work, and care within the framework of legal realism and materialist feminism. By examining the legal and economic structures that underpin these forms of labor, the study highlights how the law perpetuates and legitimizes the exploitation and undervaluation of social reproductive work. Through a critical analysis of legal doctrines and policies, the paper argues that the current legal framework fails to recognize and support the essential role of social reproduction in sustaining the economy and society. Drawing on materialist feminist theory, the research proposes a reconceptualization of law and political economy that centers the value and necessity of social reproductive labor, advocating for legal reforms that acknowledge and compensate this work. The findings suggest that a more equitable and sustainable society requires a legal system that integrates the principles of social reproduction and care."}
