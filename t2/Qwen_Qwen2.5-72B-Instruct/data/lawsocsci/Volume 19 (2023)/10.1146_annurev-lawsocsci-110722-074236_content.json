{"Abstract": "This paper explores the evolving concept of legitimacy in the context of legal authority in the twenty-first century. Drawing on a range of interdisciplinary perspectives, it examines how trust and confidence in legal institutions are shaped by normative alignment between the values of the populace and those embodied in the law. The study highlights the critical role of compliance, cooperation, and engagement as indicators of legitimacy, suggesting that these factors are increasingly influenced by the personal experiences and autobiographies of individuals. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature, the paper argues that the traditional sources of legitimacy are being challenged by new forms of social and political engagement, necessitating a reevaluation of how legal authority is perceived and maintained in contemporary society."}
