{"Abstract": "This paper integrates research on cognitive mechanisms and socialization processes to explore how children learn about race and ethnicity. Drawing on a comprehensive review of the literature, we examine the role of parental and environmental influences, as well as cognitive development, in shaping children’s racial attitudes and identities. The findings highlight the importance of both direct and indirect socialization practices, such as conversations, media exposure, and peer interactions, in the formation of racial schemas. We also discuss the implications of these mechanisms for interventions aimed at promoting positive intergroup relations and reducing racial biases in children. This integrated approach provides a nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between cognitive and social factors in children’s racial learning."}
