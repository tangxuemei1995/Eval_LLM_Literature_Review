{"Abstract": "The two-hit model of behavioral inhibition and anxiety posits that early life experiences, particularly during infancy and adolescence, play a critical role in the development of anxiety disorders. This model suggests that an initial predisposition to behavioral inhibition in infancy, characterized by heightened reactivity to novel stimuli, sets the stage for later anxiety. A second hit, such as environmental stressors or adverse life events during adolescence, can exacerbate this predisposition, leading to the manifestation of anxiety disorders. Recent studies have provided empirical support for this model, highlighting the importance of both genetic and environmental factors in the developmental origins of anxiety. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this two-hit process may offer new avenues for early intervention and prevention strategies."}
