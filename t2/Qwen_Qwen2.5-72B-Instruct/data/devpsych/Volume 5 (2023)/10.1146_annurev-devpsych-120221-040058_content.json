{"Abstract": "This study presents a rational account of cognitive control development in childhood, integrating insights from cognitive psychology and computational modeling. We propose that the development of cognitive control is driven by a maturation process that optimizes the allocation of cognitive resources based on the expected value of control. Through a series of computational simulations, we demonstrate that this rational model can account for age-related changes in cognitive control tasks, such as the ability to inhibit prepotent responses and switch between tasks. The model predicts that as children mature, their cognitive control improves due to a more efficient evaluation of the costs and benefits associated with control engagement. Empirical data from behavioral experiments support these predictions, showing that children's performance on cognitive control tasks aligns with the model's expected value calculations. This rational account provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the mechanisms underlying the development of cognitive control in childhood."}
