{"Abstract": "Cognitive flexibility, a core component of executive function, undergoes significant development throughout childhood and adolescence. This review synthesizes recent advances in developmental neuroimaging, particularly through task fMRI, to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility. Studies consistently highlight the involvement of the prefrontal cortex, particularly the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal regions, in mediating flexible cognitive processes. Developmental trajectories indicate that these regions exhibit protracted maturation, with functional connectivity strengthening over time. However, individual differences in cognitive flexibility are also influenced by factors such as genetics, environment, and experience. Future research should focus on longitudinal designs to better understand the dynamic interplay between brain structure, function, and behavior. Additionally, integrating multimodal imaging techniques and ecological assessments will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the neural bases of cognitive flexibility across development."}
