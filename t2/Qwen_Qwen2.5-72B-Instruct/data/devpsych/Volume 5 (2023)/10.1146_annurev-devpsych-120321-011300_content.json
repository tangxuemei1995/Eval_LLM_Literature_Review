{"Abstract": "This review synthesizes current knowledge on the neurodevelopment of attention, learning, and memory systems during infancy, highlighting the intricate interplay between these cognitive processes and their underlying neural substrates. Recent advances in neuroimaging and behavioral methodologies have provided unprecedented insights into how infants' brains develop the capacity to selectively attend to stimuli, learn from their environment, and form lasting memories. The development of these systems is characterized by rapid changes in neural connectivity and synaptic plasticity, which are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Key findings indicate that early attentional mechanisms are foundational for subsequent learning and memory, with critical periods during which the brain is particularly sensitive to environmental input. Understanding these developmental trajectories is crucial for identifying early markers of atypical development and informing interventions to support optimal cognitive outcomes in infants."}
