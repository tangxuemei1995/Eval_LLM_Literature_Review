{"Abstract": "This study explores the lived experiences of individuals navigating unforeseen life pathways, focusing on the interplay between resilience, vulnerability, and identity formation. Utilizing a phenomenological approach, the research delves into the autobiographical narratives of participants, uncovering the socialization processes that shape their responses to unexpected challenges. Through in-depth interviews, the study reveals how personal and social identities are redefined in the face of adversity, highlighting the dynamic nature of resilience. The findings suggest that vulnerability, often perceived as a weakness, can serve as a catalyst for personal growth and social connection. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of how individuals construct meaning and maintain a sense of self in the midst of lifeâ€™s uncertainties, offering valuable insights for psychological and sociological theories of identity and resilience."}
