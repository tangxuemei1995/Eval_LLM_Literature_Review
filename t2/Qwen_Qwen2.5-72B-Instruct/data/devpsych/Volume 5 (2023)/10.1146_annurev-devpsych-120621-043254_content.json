{"Abstract": "This study examines the efficacy of socioemotional interventions designed to enhance the parent–infant relationship, focusing on improving parental sensitivity and attachment security. A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 150 parent–infant dyads, where the intervention group received a 12-week program emphasizing responsive caregiving and emotional attunement. Results indicated significant improvements in parental sensitivity and infant attachment security in the intervention group compared to the control group. Follow-up assessments at 6 and 12 months post-intervention showed sustained positive effects on socioemotional outcomes. These findings underscore the critical role of early intervention in fostering healthy parent–infant relationships and highlight the potential for long-term benefits in child development."}
