{"Abstract": "This study examines the dynamics of emotion regulation in couples across different stages of adulthood, focusing on how aging influences these processes. Utilizing a longitudinal design, data were collected from 300 couples aged 25 to 75 years, assessing their emotion regulation strategies, relationship satisfaction, and individual well-being. Results indicate that older couples tend to employ more adaptive emotion regulation techniques, such as cognitive reappraisal, which are positively correlated with higher relationship satisfaction and lower levels of distress. Younger couples, in contrast, are more likely to use maladaptive strategies like suppression, which can lead to increased conflict and reduced well-being. The findings highlight the importance of age-related changes in emotion regulation and suggest potential targets for interventions aimed at enhancing relationship quality and emotional health in couples across the lifespan."}
