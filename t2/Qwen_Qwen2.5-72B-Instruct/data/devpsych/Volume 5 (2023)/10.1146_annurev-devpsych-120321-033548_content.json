{"Abstract": "This study investigates the developmental trajectory of infants' understanding of third-party helping interactions, a critical aspect of social cognition. Using a habituation paradigm, we examined whether 9- and 12-month-old infants can represent the goal-directed actions of a helper in a social context. Infants were presented with scenarios where an agent either helped or hindered another agent in achieving a goal. Results indicated that 12-month-olds, but not 9-month-olds, showed a significant looking time difference between helping and hindering events, suggesting that by 12 months, infants can distinguish between these social interactions. Further analysis revealed that 12-month-olds also exhibited anticipatory looking, indicating an expectation of the helper's goal-directed behavior. These findings contribute to our understanding of the emergence of goal attribution in infancy and highlight the importance of third-party interactions in the development of social cognition. Implications for the broader field of developmental psychology are discussed, emphasizing the role of early social experiences in shaping infants' expectations about the social world."}
