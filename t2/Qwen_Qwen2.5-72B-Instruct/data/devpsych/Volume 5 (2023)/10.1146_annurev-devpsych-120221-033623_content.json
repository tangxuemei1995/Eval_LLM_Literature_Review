{"Abstract": "This paper addresses the critical need to reconcile the methodologies of life-course epidemiology and causal inference to enhance our understanding of health trajectories over the lifespan. Life-course epidemiology emphasizes the importance of temporal and contextual factors in shaping health outcomes, while causal inference provides robust methods to establish cause-and-effect relationships. By integrating these approaches, we can better disentangle the complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and social determinants of health. This review highlights the potential of quantitative methods, such as natural experiments and advanced statistical techniques, to bridge the divide between these fields. We discuss the application of these methods in real-world studies, demonstrating their utility in addressing key research questions in life-course epidemiology. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and the development of innovative methodologies to advance our understanding of health across the life course."}
