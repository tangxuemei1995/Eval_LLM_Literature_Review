{"Abstract": "This study explores the complex interplay of social identities and intersectionality in the development of youth, employing a mixed-methods approach to provide a nuanced understanding of how multiple identities intersect and influence individual experiences. Drawing on critical race theory and interdisciplinary perspectives, the research examines the ways in which race, gender, class, and other social categories interact to shape the identity development of young people. Through a combination of quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews, the study highlights the importance of recognizing and addressing the unique challenges faced by youth at the intersections of multiple marginalized identities. The findings suggest that a more inclusive and intersectional approach to youth development is essential for creating supportive environments that foster positive identity formation and well-being. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on intersectionality and identity development, offering practical insights for educators, policymakers, and practitioners working with diverse youth populations."}
