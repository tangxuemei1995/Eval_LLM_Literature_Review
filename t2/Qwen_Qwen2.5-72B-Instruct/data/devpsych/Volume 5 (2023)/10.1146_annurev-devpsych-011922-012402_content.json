{"Abstract": "This review synthesizes recent advancements in understanding the impact of poverty on brain development and mental health, highlighting the role of neuroimaging and developmental psychopathology. Despite significant progress, challenges remain in replicating findings and translating research into effective interventions. Studies consistently show that chronic adversity associated with poverty can alter brain structure and function, particularly in regions involved in stress regulation, cognition, and emotion. However, the heterogeneity of poverty-related stressors and the complex interplay with genetic and environmental factors complicate efforts to establish causal pathways. Neuroimaging techniques, such as MRI and fMRI, have been instrumental in identifying these neural changes, but issues of replicability and reproducibility persist. Future research must address these methodological challenges and integrate multidisciplinary approaches to better understand the mechanisms underlying poverty's effects on brain development and mental health, ultimately informing more targeted and effective interventions."}
