{"Abstract": "Prenatal substance exposure (PSE) is a significant public health concern, affecting developmental outcomes in children exposed to substances such as alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs during pregnancy. This review synthesizes current research on the long-term impacts of PSE, highlighting the complex interplay between prenatal adversity and early developmental trajectories. Studies consistently show that PSE is associated with increased risks of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional problems, as well as poorer academic performance and social functioning. However, the severity of these outcomes varies widely, influenced by factors such as the type and quantity of substance exposure, maternal health, and postnatal environmental support. Interventions targeting at-risk families, including prenatal care and postnatal support services, are crucial for mitigating the adverse effects of PSE and promoting healthier developmental outcomes."}
