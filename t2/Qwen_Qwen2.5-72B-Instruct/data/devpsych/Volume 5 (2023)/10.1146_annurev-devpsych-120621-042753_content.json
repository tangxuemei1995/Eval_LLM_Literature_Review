{"Abstract": "This review synthesizes recent advancements in developmental social neuroscience to inform early interventions for infants at risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). By integrating neuroimaging, behavioral, and genetic studies, we highlight the critical periods during early brain development that are particularly sensitive to environmental influences. Key findings indicate that early social experiences, such as parent-infant interactions, can modulate neural circuits involved in social cognition and communication, which are often atypical in ASD. We discuss the potential of targeted interventions, such as parent-mediated therapies, to enhance social engagement and neural connectivity in high-risk infants. These interventions aim to capitalize on the brain's plasticity during the first years of life, potentially mitigating the severity of ASD symptoms. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies to assess the long-term efficacy of these interventions and to identify biomarkers that can predict response to treatment. This integrative approach underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary framework in advancing our understanding of ASD and improving early intervention strategies."}
