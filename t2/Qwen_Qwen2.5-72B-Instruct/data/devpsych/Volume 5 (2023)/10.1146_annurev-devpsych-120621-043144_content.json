{"Abstract": "This review synthesizes current research on the functioning of offspring of depressed parents, highlighting the psychobiological and neurostructural correlates. Studies consistently show increased risk for mood and anxiety disorders, with emerging evidence linking these outcomes to altered brain structure, particularly in regions involved in emotion regulation. However, the impact of environmental factors, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, remains underexplored. Unresolved issues include the need for longitudinal studies to elucidate causal pathways and the role of genetic and epigenetic factors. Future research should also focus on developing targeted interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of parental depression on offspring, considering the complex interplay between biological and environmental factors."}
