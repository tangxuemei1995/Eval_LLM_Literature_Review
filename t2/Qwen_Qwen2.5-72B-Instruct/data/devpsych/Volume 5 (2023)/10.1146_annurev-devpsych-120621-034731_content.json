{"Abstract": "This study explores the acquisition and application of norms in young children, focusing on the interplay between norm psychology and social-cognitive development. Through a series of observational and experimental tasks, we investigated how children aged 3 to 6 years understand and apply social norms, including moral and conventional norms. Results indicate that children demonstrate a nuanced understanding of normativity, distinguishing between different types of norms and their contexts. Furthermore, the study reveals that children's ability to apply norms is influenced by their social-cognitive development, with older children showing more sophisticated reasoning and application. These findings contribute to our understanding of how young children integrate norms into their social behavior, highlighting the importance of both cognitive and social factors in the development of normative behavior."}
