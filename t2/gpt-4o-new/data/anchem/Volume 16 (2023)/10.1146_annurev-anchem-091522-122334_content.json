{"Abstract": "This guide provides an introduction to micro- and nanoscale electrochemical additive manufacturing, focusing on techniques such as meniscus-confined electrodeposition (MCED), FluidFM, and electrohydrodynamic redox printing (EHD-RP). These methods leverage precise control over material deposition at the micro- and nanoscale, enabling the fabrication of complex structures with high resolution. The use of nanopipettes and scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) enhances the precision of these techniques, allowing for the creation of intricate patterns and features. This guide aims to equip beginners with a foundational understanding of these advanced manufacturing processes, highlighting their applications, advantages, and potential challenges. By exploring these innovative techniques, researchers can expand the possibilities of 3D printing in various scientific and industrial fields."}
