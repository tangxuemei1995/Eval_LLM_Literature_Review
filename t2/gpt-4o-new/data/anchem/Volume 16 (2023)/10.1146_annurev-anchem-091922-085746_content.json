{"Abstract": "The increasing need for comprehensive coastal and ocean monitoring has driven advancements in sensor technologies, enabling more effective environmental management and research. This review explores the current state of in situ sensors and sensor networks used in oceanography, emphasizing their applications in coastal monitoring. Key technologies include a variety of sensors capable of measuring physical, chemical, and biological parameters, which are crucial for understanding complex marine ecosystems. The integration of these sensors into networks enhances data collection, providing real-time insights into oceanic conditions. However, challenges such as biofouling, which affects sensor accuracy and longevity, remain significant obstacles. This review discusses recent innovations aimed at mitigating biofouling and improving sensor performance. Additionally, the paper highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in developing robust sensor systems that can adapt to the dynamic marine environment. Future directions include the advancement of autonomous platforms and the incorporation of artificial intelligence to enhance data analysis and decision-making processes."}
