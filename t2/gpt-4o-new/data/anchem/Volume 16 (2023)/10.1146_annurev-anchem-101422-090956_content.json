{"Abstract": "Digital histopathology using infrared spectroscopic imaging represents a transformative approach in the analysis of tissue samples. This method leverages the unique vibrational signatures of molecular bonds, providing a chemical map of the tissue without the need for staining. The integration of machine learning and deep learning algorithms enhances the interpretative power of infrared spectroscopy, enabling automated and accurate classification of pathological states. Recent advancements in imaging technology have improved spatial resolution and acquisition speed, making it feasible for clinical applications. The combination of chemical imaging with digital pathology offers a non-destructive, label-free alternative to traditional histological techniques, potentially increasing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. This review discusses the current state of infrared spectroscopic imaging in digital pathology, highlighting its advantages, challenges, and future prospects. Emphasis is placed on the role of computational methods in processing and analyzing complex spectral data, which is crucial for the successful implementation of this technology in routine clinical practice."}
