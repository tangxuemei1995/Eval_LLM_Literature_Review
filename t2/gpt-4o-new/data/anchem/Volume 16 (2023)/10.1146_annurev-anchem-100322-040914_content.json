{"Abstract": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of healthcare, biosensors have emerged as pivotal tools for enhancing decision support systems and ensuring meaningful use of medical data. This study explores the integration of biosensors within a system-level framework, emphasizing their role in improving quality of service and fostering a robust knowledge network. By continuously monitoring physiological parameters, biosensors provide real-time data that can be seamlessly integrated into healthcare systems, enabling timely and informed decision-making. The research highlights the potential of biosensors to bridge gaps in patient care by offering precise, actionable insights that enhance clinical outcomes. Furthermore, the study discusses the challenges and opportunities associated with the deployment of biosensors, including data privacy, interoperability, and the need for standardized protocols. Ultimately, this work underscores the transformative impact of biosensors in creating a connected world where healthcare delivery is more efficient, personalized, and responsive to the needs of patients and providers alike."}
