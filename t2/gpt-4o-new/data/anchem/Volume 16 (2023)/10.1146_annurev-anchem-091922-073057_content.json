{"Abstract": "Recent advances in single-molecule tracking and imaging techniques have significantly enhanced our ability to study dynamic biological processes at the molecular level. Innovations such as feedback-control tracking and point-spread-function engineering have improved the precision and temporal resolution of single-molecule observations. These techniques allow for the real-time tracking of individual molecules in complex environments, providing insights into their behavior and interactions. Multiple plane microscopy has further expanded the dimensionality of single-molecule imaging, enabling the capture of three-dimensional trajectories and facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of molecular dynamics. Advanced trajectory analysis and clustering analysis methods have been developed to interpret the vast amounts of data generated, allowing researchers to identify patterns and infer molecular mechanisms with greater accuracy. These technological advancements are paving the way for new discoveries in fields such as cell biology, biophysics, and nanotechnology, offering unprecedented opportunities to explore the fundamental processes of life at the single-molecule level."}
