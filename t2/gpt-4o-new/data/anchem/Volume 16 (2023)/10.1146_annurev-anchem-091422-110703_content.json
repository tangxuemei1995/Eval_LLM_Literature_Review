{"Abstract": "The study of interfaces in energy storage systems is crucial for advancing battery technology. This paper reviews the application of scanning probe methods, including Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electrochemical Cell Microscopy (SECCM), Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy (SECM), and Scanning Ion Conductance Microscopy (SICM), in electrochemical imaging of these interfaces. These techniques provide high-resolution insights into the morphological and electrochemical properties of battery interfaces, which are pivotal for understanding degradation mechanisms and improving performance. The integration of automation and deep learning algorithms is highlighted as a transformative approach to enhance data acquisition and analysis, enabling more efficient and accurate characterization. The paper discusses current applications, such as in lithium-ion and solid-state batteries, and explores future prospects for these technologies in energy storage research. The potential for these methods to drive innovation in battery design and optimization is emphasized, underscoring their importance in the development of next-generation energy storage solutions."}
