{"Abstract": "Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) offers a transformative approach to nondestructive 3D pathology, enabling unprecedented insights into tissue architecture and cellular interactions. This technique, pivotal for translational research and clinical assays, integrates computational and digital pathology with optical-sectioning microscopy to enhance spatial biology analysis. By providing high-resolution, volumetric imaging, LSFM facilitates precise mapping of molecular and cellular landscapes, crucial for advancing precision medicine. The method's ability to preserve tissue integrity while delivering comprehensive spatial data supports its application in diverse pathological assessments, from tumor microenvironment studies to organ-wide disease mapping. This paper explores the integration of LSFM in clinical workflows, highlighting its potential to revolutionize diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic strategies through enhanced visualization and quantification of complex biological systems."}
