{"Abstract": "Microfluidics has emerged as a transformative tool for studying biofilms, offering precise control over flow dynamics and shear stress, which are critical for understanding biofilm formation and behavior. This technology enables in situ visualization of biofilms, providing real-time insights into their structural and functional dynamics. The integration of microfluidics with organ-on-chip systems and biosensors enhances the study of biofilm interactions with host tissues and the environment. Furthermore, microfluidic platforms are pivotal in evaluating antifouling strategies and antimicrobial resistance, facilitating the development of novel therapeutic approaches. This review highlights the potential of microfluidics in advancing biofilm research, emphasizing its role in addressing critical challenges in healthcare and environmental applications."}
