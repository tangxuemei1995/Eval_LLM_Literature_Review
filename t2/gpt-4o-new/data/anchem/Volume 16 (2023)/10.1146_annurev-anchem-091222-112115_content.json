{"Abstract": "The accurate detection and quantification of organic micropollutants in water samples are critical for environmental monitoring and public health. This study explores efficient validation strategies in environmental analytical chemistry, emphasizing method validation, quality assurance, and quality control. We focus on the application of liquid and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, which are pivotal in identifying and quantifying trace levels of organic micropollutants. The research outlines a comprehensive approach to method validation, including precision, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity assessments, ensuring reliable analytical results. Quality assurance and control measures are discussed to maintain the integrity of analytical processes and data. The study highlights the importance of robust validation protocols to enhance the reliability of environmental assessments and regulatory compliance. By optimizing these strategies, the research aims to improve the detection capabilities and analytical performance in monitoring organic micropollutants in aquatic environments."}
