{"Abstract": "CRISPR-based biosensing strategies have emerged as a transformative approach in the detection and analysis of nucleic acids, proteins, and small molecules. This review highlights recent technical advancements in CRISPR technology, focusing on its integration into biosensing platforms. The programmability and specificity of CRISPR systems, particularly CRISPR-Cas12 and CRISPR-Cas13, have enabled the development of highly sensitive and selective biosensors. These systems offer rapid, cost-effective, and portable solutions for diagnostic applications, ranging from infectious disease detection to environmental monitoring. The versatility of CRISPR-based biosensors is further enhanced by their ability to be adapted for multiplexed and real-time analysis. Future prospects include the expansion of CRISPR biosensing to broader applications, improved signal amplification techniques, and the integration with microfluidic and digital platforms, paving the way for next-generation diagnostic tools."}
