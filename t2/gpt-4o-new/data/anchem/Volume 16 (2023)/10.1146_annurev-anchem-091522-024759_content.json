{"Abstract": "Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affect over a billion people worldwide, predominantly in low-resource settings where access to advanced diagnostic tools is limited. This study explores the development and application of low-cost microfluidic systems for the detection of NTDs, focusing on paper-based microfluidics and lateral flow assays. These systems offer a promising alternative to traditional diagnostic methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and immunochromatographic tests, providing rapid, point-of-care testing capabilities. The integration of microfluidic technology with simple, cost-effective materials enables the creation of portable diagnostic devices that are both user-friendly and efficient. By leveraging the principles of fluid dynamics and capillary action, these systems can deliver accurate results with minimal sample volumes and without the need for complex laboratory infrastructure. This research highlights the potential of microfluidic platforms to revolutionize clinical diagnosis in resource-limited settings, ultimately improving disease management and patient outcomes for those affected by NTDs."}
