{"Abstract": "Gels in microscale electrophoresis have revolutionized the separation and analysis of biomolecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and glycans. This study explores the application of capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) and microfluidic gel electrophoresis (MGE) in providing high-resolution separations with minimal sample and reagent consumption. The choice of sieving matrix is critical, influencing the separation efficiency and resolution. Advances in gel formulations and microfabrication techniques have enhanced the performance of these systems, enabling rapid and precise analysis in various fields, including genomics, proteomics, and glycomics. This paper reviews recent developments in gel materials and their integration into microfluidic platforms, highlighting their impact on analytical throughput and sensitivity. The findings underscore the potential of microscale electrophoresis technologies to facilitate high-throughput biomolecular analysis, offering significant advantages over traditional electrophoresis methods in terms of speed, efficiency, and scalability."}
