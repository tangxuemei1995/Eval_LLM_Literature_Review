{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in direct mass spectrometry technologies have significantly enhanced tissue analysis, offering promising applications in clinical diagnostics. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has emerged as a powerful tool, providing spatially resolved molecular information that aids in the understanding of complex biological systems. The development of ambient ionization techniques has further expanded the capabilities of MSI, allowing for rapid and minimally invasive analysis of tissues in their native state. These innovations have paved the way for the creation of handheld mass spectrometry-based devices, which hold the potential to revolutionize point-of-care diagnostics by enabling real-time, on-site analysis. This review highlights the latest technological advancements in direct mass spectrometry, explores their emerging medical applications, and discusses the challenges and future directions in integrating these technologies into routine clinical practice. The integration of these cutting-edge tools promises to enhance diagnostic accuracy and improve patient outcomes."}
