{"Abstract": "The Deepwater Horizon oil spill highlighted the urgent need for advanced analytical techniques to characterize petroleum and petroleum-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) in marine environments. This study reviews emerging chemical methods, focusing on the application of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and fluorescence spectroscopy, to analyze petrogenic DOM. ICP-MS offers precise quantification of trace metals, providing insights into the elemental composition of black carbon and other complex organic matrices. Fluorescence spectroscopy, on the other hand, enables the detection of aromatic hydrocarbons, facilitating the differentiation between natural and anthropogenic sources of DOM. These methods, when integrated, enhance the understanding of the chemical transformations and environmental fate of oil-derived compounds. The findings underscore the importance of developing robust analytical frameworks to monitor and mitigate the impacts of oil spills on marine ecosystems, contributing to more effective environmental management strategies."}
