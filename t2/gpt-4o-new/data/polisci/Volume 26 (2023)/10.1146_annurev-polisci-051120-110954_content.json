{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of gender and international relations, emphasizing the critical role of gender and sexuality in shaping global political dynamics. By integrating feminist theories and gender analysis, the research highlights how traditional international relations frameworks often overlook the influence of gendered power structures. The study examines the impact of gender on foreign policy decisions, international political economy, and global governance, revealing how gender biases can perpetuate inequalities and affect diplomatic outcomes. Through a comprehensive review of case studies and theoretical models, the research underscores the necessity of incorporating gender perspectives to achieve a more inclusive and equitable understanding of international relations. The findings advocate for a re-evaluation of existing policies and suggest strategies for integrating gender considerations into the core of international political discourse, ultimately contributing to more balanced and effective global governance."}
