{"Abstract": "The intersection of international energy politics and climate change presents a complex landscape characterized by competing interests and transformative potential. This study examines the dynamics of energy politics in the context of a global shift towards clean energy, driven by the urgent need to mitigate climate change. It explores how traditional energy sources, particularly oil, continue to influence geopolitical strategies and distributive politics, even as nations commit to reducing carbon emissions. The research highlights the challenges and opportunities inherent in the clean energy transition, including the redistribution of power among energy-producing and consuming nations. By analyzing policy frameworks, international agreements, and market trends, this study provides insights into the evolving role of energy in global politics. It underscores the necessity for collaborative approaches to ensure equitable and sustainable energy solutions, emphasizing the critical balance between economic interests and environmental imperatives in shaping future energy policies."}
