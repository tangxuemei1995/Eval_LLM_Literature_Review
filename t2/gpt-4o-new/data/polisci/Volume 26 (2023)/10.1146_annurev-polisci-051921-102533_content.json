{"Abstract": "Agenda Democracy explores the dynamic interplay between agenda setting and democratic processes, emphasizing the role of social movements, petitions, and advocacy in shaping public discourse and policy. This study investigates how agendas are constructed and contested within democratic frameworks, highlighting the mechanisms through which citizens and interest groups influence political priorities. By analyzing case studies of successful and unsuccessful agenda-setting efforts, the research identifies key factors that enable or hinder democratic engagement in agenda formation. The findings suggest that while traditional political institutions retain significant control over agenda setting, grassroots movements and digital platforms are increasingly pivotal in amplifying diverse voices and fostering participatory democracy. The study underscores the importance of transparency, inclusivity, and responsiveness in agenda-setting processes to enhance democratic legitimacy and accountability. Ultimately, Agenda Democracy calls for a reevaluation of how agendas are crafted and contested, advocating for more equitable and participatory approaches to ensure that diverse societal interests are adequately represented in democratic governance."}
