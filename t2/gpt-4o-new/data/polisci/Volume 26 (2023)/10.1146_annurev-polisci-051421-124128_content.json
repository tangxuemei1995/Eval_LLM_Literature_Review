{"Abstract": "This study explores the complex interplay between violence and nonviolent resistance movements, focusing on the impact of violent flanks and unarmed collective violence, such as riots, on the efficacy of nonviolent protests. By analyzing historical and contemporary case studies, the research investigates how the presence of violence within or alongside nonviolent movements influences public perception, media coverage, and governmental response. The findings suggest that while violent flanks can sometimes draw attention to a cause, they often undermine the legitimacy and moral high ground of nonviolent campaigns, potentially reducing their overall effectiveness. However, in certain contexts, the threat or occurrence of violence may pressure authorities to engage in dialogue or reform. This nuanced understanding of the role of violence in nonviolent resistance highlights the strategic considerations for activists and policymakers aiming to achieve social and political change through peaceful means."}
