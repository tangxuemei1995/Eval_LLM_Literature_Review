{"Abstract": "This study explores the evolving political role of business leaders, focusing on their influence through money, lobbying, and civic engagement. As corporate social responsibility (CSR) becomes increasingly integral to business strategy, CEOs are stepping into the public sphere, advocating for social and political issues. This phenomenon, known as CEO activism, reflects a shift in the traditional boundaries between business and politics. The research examines how business leaders leverage financial resources and lobbying efforts to shape policy and public opinion, while also engaging in civic activities that align with their corporate values. By analyzing case studies and empirical data, the study highlights the impact of these activities on both corporate reputation and societal outcomes. The findings suggest that business leaders are not only economic actors but also significant political players, whose actions can drive social change and influence governance structures."}
