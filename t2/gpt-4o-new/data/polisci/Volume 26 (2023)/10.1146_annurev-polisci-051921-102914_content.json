{"Abstract": "Bureaucratic autonomy is a critical concept in understanding the dynamics between political control and administrative discretion within governmental systems. This study explores the multifaceted nature of bureaucratic autonomy, examining how it is defined and operationalized across different political and legal contexts. By analyzing the interplay between delegation and discretion, the research highlights the conditions under which bureaucracies can act independently from political influence, while still being accountable to democratic principles. Through a comparative approach, the study investigates variations in bureaucratic autonomy across diverse political systems and administrative law frameworks. The findings suggest that bureaucratic autonomy is not a monolithic concept but rather a spectrum influenced by institutional design, legal traditions, and political culture. This research contributes to the broader discourse in comparative politics and administrative law by providing a nuanced understanding of how bureaucratic autonomy shapes governance and policy implementation."}
