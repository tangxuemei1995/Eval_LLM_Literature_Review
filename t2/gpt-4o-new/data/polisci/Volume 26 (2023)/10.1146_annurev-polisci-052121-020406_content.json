{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intricate dynamics of authoritarian power sharing, exploring the concepts, mechanisms, and strategies that underpin governance in non-democratic regimes. Authoritarian power sharing is crucial for regime stability, as it addresses commitment problems and mitigates the risks of coups and civil wars. The research examines how institutions are designed to distribute power among elites, ensuring loyalty and reducing the likelihood of internal conflict. By analyzing historical and contemporary case studies, the study identifies key strategies employed by authoritarian leaders to maintain control, such as co-opting potential rivals and establishing robust security apparatuses. The findings highlight the delicate balance between coercion and co-optation, revealing how authoritarian regimes adapt to internal and external pressures. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the resilience and vulnerabilities of authoritarian systems, offering insights into the conditions under which power sharing can either stabilize or destabilize these regimes."}
