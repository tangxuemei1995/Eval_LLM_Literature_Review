{"Abstract": "This study seeks to integrate the diverse strands of research examining how environmental contexts influence political behavior, with a particular focus on contact theory and neighborhood effects. By synthesizing findings from ethnic politics, inequality, and the built environment, this research aims to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the multifaceted ways in which context shapes political attitudes and actions. The analysis highlights the role of social interactions and spatial configurations in mediating political outcomes, emphasizing the importance of both physical and social environments. Through a review of empirical studies and theoretical models, the paper identifies key mechanisms by which context and contact interact to influence political behavior. This unifying approach not only advances the theoretical understanding of environmental effects on politics but also offers practical insights for policymakers seeking to address issues of inequality and social cohesion in diverse communities."}
