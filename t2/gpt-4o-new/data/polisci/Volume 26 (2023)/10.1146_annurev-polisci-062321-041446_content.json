{"Abstract": "This study examines the intricate dynamics of racist dehumanization within the political landscape of the United States, focusing on its impact on racial attitudes towards Black, Indigenous, and other marginalized communities. By analyzing historical and contemporary instances of dehumanization, the research highlights how these practices are perpetuated through political rhetoric and policy. The study employs a multidisciplinary approach, drawing from sociology, political science, and psychology, to explore the mechanisms by which racial prejudice is institutionalized and normalized. It further investigates the role of media and political discourse in shaping public perceptions and attitudes towards race. The findings underscore the persistent influence of dehumanizing narratives in reinforcing systemic racism and suggest pathways for fostering more equitable racial attitudes. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the socio-political factors that sustain racial hierarchies and offers insights for policy interventions aimed at combating racism."}
