{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between democracy and policing in the United States, focusing on the dynamics of multiracial democracy and racial authoritarianism. By examining the historical and contemporary intersections of identity, criminal justice, and governance, the research highlights how policing practices have both shaped and been shaped by democratic ideals and racial hierarchies. The analysis delves into the systemic challenges faced by marginalized communities, particularly in the context of law enforcement and its impact on democratic participation and representation. Through a critical lens, the study interrogates the role of policing in perpetuating racial inequalities and its implications for the broader democratic framework. By engaging with diverse perspectives and empirical data, the research aims to foster a nuanced conversation about the potential for reform and the reimagining of policing within a truly inclusive democratic society. Ultimately, this work seeks to contribute to the ongoing discourse on how to reconcile the principles of democracy with the realities of racialized policing practices, advocating for transformative justice and equity."}
