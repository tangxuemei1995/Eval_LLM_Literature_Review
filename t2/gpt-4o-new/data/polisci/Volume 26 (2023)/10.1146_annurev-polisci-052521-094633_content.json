{"Abstract": "This study examines the evolution of global health governance from the era of imperialism through the so-called 'Golden Age' of international health cooperation, culminating in the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. It explores the political dynamics that have shaped the roles and effectiveness of key international health organizations, particularly the World Health Organization (WHO), in addressing global health crises. The research highlights how historical contexts, such as colonial legacies and geopolitical interests, have influenced the development and implementation of health policies on a global scale. The analysis delves into the 'Golden Age' of global health, characterized by increased collaboration and resource allocation, and contrasts it with the fragmented response observed during the Great Lockdown. The study underscores the political tensions and power imbalances that have hindered cohesive global health strategies, emphasizing the need for reform in governance structures to enhance responsiveness and equity. By tracing the trajectory of global health governance, this research provides insights into the complexities of international cooperation and the critical role of political will in shaping effective health responses in an increasingly interconnected world."}
