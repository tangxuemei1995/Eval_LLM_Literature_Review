{"Abstract": "This study explores the multifaceted dynamics of women and power in the developing world, focusing on the intersection of gender equality and political development. By examining the role of women in politics, the research highlights the impact of electoral quotas and other policy measures designed to enhance female political representation. The analysis draws on comparative political development frameworks to assess how state formation processes influence gender dynamics and the empowerment of women. Additionally, the study investigates intrafamily bargaining as a critical factor in shaping women's access to power and decision-making roles within both domestic and political spheres. Through a synthesis of case studies and empirical data, the research identifies key barriers and facilitators to women's political participation and leadership. The findings underscore the importance of institutional reforms and cultural shifts in promoting gender equality and suggest pathways for enhancing women's influence in political arenas across diverse developing contexts. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between gender, power, and development."}
