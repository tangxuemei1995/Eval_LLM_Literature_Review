{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intricate dynamics of bureaucratic politics, highlighting both the blind spots and opportunities within political science. By examining the roles of personnel appointments and their impact on bureaucratic performance, the research underscores the significance of strategic oversight and accountability mechanisms. The analysis reveals how bureaucratic influence is often shaped by lobbying efforts and procurement processes, which can either enhance or undermine public sector efficiency. Furthermore, the study identifies gaps in current political science literature, particularly in understanding the nuanced interactions between bureaucratic entities and political actors. By addressing these blind spots, the research offers new avenues for enhancing bureaucratic accountability and performance. Ultimately, this work contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between bureaucracy and politics, providing insights for scholars and policymakers alike."}
