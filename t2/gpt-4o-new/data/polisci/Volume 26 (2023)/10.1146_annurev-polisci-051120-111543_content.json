{"Abstract": "This study explores a multi-level approach to supply chain governance, emphasizing the intricate interplay between structure and context within complex networks. By integrating concepts of polycentricity, the research highlights how diverse governance mechanisms operate across different levels of the supply chain, from local to global contexts. The study examines how environmental and labor considerations are embedded within these governance structures, influencing decision-making processes and outcomes. Through a comprehensive analysis of supply chain networks, the research identifies key factors that contribute to effective governance, including adaptability, transparency, and stakeholder engagement. The findings suggest that a polycentric governance model, which accommodates multiple centers of decision-making, can enhance the resilience and sustainability of supply chains. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the dynamic interactions between various actors and the environments in which they operate. The study contributes to the literature by providing a framework for analyzing supply chain governance that accounts for complexity and contextual variability, offering insights for both scholars and practitioners."}
