{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between the state and public trust, focusing on the impact of governmental sanctions and corruption. Trust in state institutions is a cornerstone of effective governance, yet it is frequently undermined by corruption, which erodes public confidence and hampers policy implementation. The research examines how sanctions, as a tool of state power, can either restore or further diminish trust, depending on their perceived fairness and effectiveness. By analyzing case studies and empirical data, the study identifies patterns in how different states manage trust through their sanctioning mechanisms. The findings suggest that transparent and accountable governance practices are crucial in maintaining public trust, even in the presence of necessary sanctions. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the dynamics between state actions and public trust, offering insights for policymakers aiming to enhance governance and societal cohesion."}
