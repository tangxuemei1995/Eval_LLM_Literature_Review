{"Abstract": "This study examines the economic backgrounds of political elites, focusing on class, education, and wealth, to understand their impact on political representation. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of politicians from various democratic nations, the research identifies patterns in socioeconomic status and educational attainment among elected officials. The findings reveal a significant overrepresentation of individuals from affluent backgrounds, often with prestigious educational credentials, suggesting a potential barrier to diverse representation. The study explores how these economic factors influence policy decisions and public trust in political institutions. Additionally, it considers the implications of this homogeneity for democratic processes and the potential for reforms aimed at increasing inclusivity. By highlighting the intersection of wealth, education, and political power, this research contributes to the broader discourse on social equity and the democratization of political systems, offering insights into the challenges and opportunities for achieving more representative governance."}
