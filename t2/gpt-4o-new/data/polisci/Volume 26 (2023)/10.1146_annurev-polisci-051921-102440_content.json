{"Abstract": "Historical political economy examines the enduring impact of historical events and institutions on contemporary political and economic outcomes. This field integrates insights from history, economics, and political science to understand how legacies of the past shape present-day governance and development. By employing causal inference techniques and formal theory, researchers can identify persistent patterns and mechanisms through which historical factors influence modern societies. The study of historical political economy not only sheds light on the origins of current political and economic disparities but also informs policy interventions aimed at addressing these inequalities. As the field evolves, future research is poised to explore new methodological approaches and expand its scope to include diverse historical contexts. This interdisciplinary approach promises to deepen our understanding of the complex interplay between history and political economy, offering valuable insights for both scholars and policymakers."}
