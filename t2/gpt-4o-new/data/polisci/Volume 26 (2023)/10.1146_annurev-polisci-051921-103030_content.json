{"Abstract": "This study explores the evolution of growth and welfare regimes through a comparative political economy lens, focusing on the transition from Fordism to financialization and the emergence of the knowledge-based economy. By examining diverse national trajectories, the research highlights how different countries have navigated these economic paradigms, resulting in varied welfare state configurations and growth outcomes. The analysis underscores the role of institutional frameworks and policy choices in shaping these paths, revealing that while global trends such as financialization and technological advancement influence all economies, local adaptations and historical contexts lead to distinct developmental patterns. The study contributes to the understanding of how welfare regimes adapt to changing economic conditions, emphasizing the interplay between global economic forces and national policy responses. This research provides insights into the sustainability and inclusivity of growth models, offering a nuanced perspective on the future of welfare states in an increasingly interconnected world."}
