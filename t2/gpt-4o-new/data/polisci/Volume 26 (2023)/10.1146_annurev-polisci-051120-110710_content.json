{"Abstract": "This study examines the pivotal role of the American South in shaping national political development, with a focus on the enduring legacies of Jim Crow, authoritarianism, and white supremacy. The South's unique political landscape, characterized by its historical commitment to racial segregation and disenfranchisement, has significantly influenced broader American political dynamics. Through an analysis of southern politics, this research highlights how the region's political strategies and ideologies have permeated national policies, particularly during the New Deal era. The study explores the mechanisms through which southern political elites maintained power and how their influence extended beyond regional boundaries, affecting federal legislation and party politics. By tracing the evolution of southern political influence, this research provides insights into the complex interplay between regional and national politics, underscoring the South's critical role in shaping the trajectory of American political development and the persistence of racial and authoritarian legacies."}
