{"Abstract": "This study examines the multifaceted nature of political inequality in affluent democratic nations, focusing on participation, representation, congruence, and responsiveness. It explores how income inequality exacerbates disparities in political engagement and influence, leading to a democratic deficit where the interests of lower-income groups are underrepresented. The research highlights the role of trade unions as potential mitigators of political inequality, advocating for their capacity to enhance political participation and ensure more equitable representation. By analyzing cross-national data, the study identifies patterns of political congruence and responsiveness, revealing that higher income inequality often correlates with reduced political alignment between elected officials and the general populace. The findings underscore the necessity for policy interventions aimed at strengthening democratic institutions and promoting inclusive political processes to counteract the adverse effects of economic disparities on democratic governance."}
