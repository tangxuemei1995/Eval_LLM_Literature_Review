{"Abstract": "This study examines the phenomenon of police killings in the United States through a comparative lens, highlighting the exceptional nature of American policing in terms of the use of deadly force. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset, the research contrasts the frequency and circumstances of police killings in the U.S. with those in other developed nations. The analysis reveals that the decentralized structure of American policing, coupled with a lack of uniform accountability measures, contributes significantly to the higher incidence of lethal encounters. The concept of American exceptionalism is explored, suggesting that cultural, legal, and institutional factors uniquely shape the operational environment of U.S. law enforcement. The study also delves into the implications of these findings for police accountability and reform, emphasizing the need for standardized protocols and enhanced oversight mechanisms. By situating American police killings within a global context, this research underscores the urgent necessity for policy interventions aimed at reducing the use of deadly force and fostering a more accountable policing framework. The findings contribute to the broader discourse on comparative policing and the pursuit of justice and equity in law enforcement practices."}
