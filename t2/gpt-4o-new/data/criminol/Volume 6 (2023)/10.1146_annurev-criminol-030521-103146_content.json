{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant challenges to carceral systems worldwide, where overcrowding, limited healthcare access, and high turnover rates exacerbate the spread of infectious diseases. This review examines the incidence of COVID-19 within prisons and jails, highlighting the unique vulnerabilities of incarcerated populations. It explores the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies implemented to curb the virus's spread, including social distancing measures, enhanced sanitation protocols, and the use of personal protective equipment. The review also assesses the role of vaccination campaigns in these settings, considering both the logistical challenges and the ethical implications of prioritizing incarcerated individuals for vaccination. Data from multiple jurisdictions are analyzed to provide a comprehensive overview of the pandemic's impact on carceral systems, with a focus on identifying best practices and areas for improvement. The findings underscore the need for systemic reforms to address the health inequities faced by incarcerated populations and emphasize the importance of integrating public health strategies into the management of correctional facilities to better prepare for future public health emergencies."}
