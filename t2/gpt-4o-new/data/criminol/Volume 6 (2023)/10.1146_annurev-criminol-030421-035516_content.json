{"Abstract": "This study explores the revitalization of historical criminology, emphasizing its scope, significance, and future directions. Historical criminology, which examines the interplay between crime, law, and society over time, offers critical insights into contemporary criminal justice issues. By integrating historical time into criminological analysis, researchers can uncover patterns and transformations in criminal behavior and legal responses. This interdisciplinary approach draws from history, sociology, and law, enriching our understanding of the socio-cultural contexts that shape crime and justice. The paper argues for a renewed focus on historical criminology to address current challenges in criminal justice, such as systemic inequalities and policy reform. It highlights the importance of historical perspectives in informing evidence-based practices and fostering a more nuanced understanding of crime's evolution. Future directions include expanding methodological frameworks and fostering collaborations across disciplines to enhance the field's relevance and impact in addressing modern criminological concerns."}
