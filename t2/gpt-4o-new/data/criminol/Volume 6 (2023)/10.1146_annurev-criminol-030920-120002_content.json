{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of Latino/a/x experiences with the criminal legal system through the lens of LatCrit, a branch of critical race theory that focuses on the unique social, political, and economic challenges faced by Latino/a/x communities. Despite the growing Latino/a/x population in the United States, criminological theories have historically overlooked the nuanced ways in which race and ethnicity shape their interactions with the criminal justice system. This paper seeks to fill this gap by integrating LatCrit perspectives into criminological discourse, offering a more comprehensive understanding of Latino/a/x crime and criminal legal system involvement. \n\nThe research examines how systemic racism, cultural stereotypes, and socio-economic disparities contribute to the overrepresentation of Latino/a/x individuals in crime statistics and their disproportionate involvement in the criminal legal system. By employing a LatCrit framework, the study highlights the importance of considering the intersectionality of race, ethnicity, and other identity markers in criminological research. It also critiques existing criminological theories for their failure to adequately address the structural and institutional factors that influence Latino/a/x criminalization. \n\nThrough a review of existing literature and case studies, this paper demonstrates the need for a paradigm shift in criminology that incorporates LatCrit insights to better understand and address the complexities of Latino/a/x experiences with crime and justice. The findings underscore the importance of developing policies and practices that are informed by a critical understanding of race and ethnicity, ultimately advocating for a more equitable and just criminal legal system. This research contributes to the broader discourse on race, ethnicity, and justice, urging scholars and policymakers to re-evaluate traditional criminological approaches in light of LatCrit theory."}
