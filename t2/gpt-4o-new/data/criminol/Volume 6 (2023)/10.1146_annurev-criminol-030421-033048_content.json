{"Abstract": "This study revisits the ethnographic exploration of immigration and crime, drawing inspiration from the foundational work of the Chicago School. By employing qualitative methods, this research aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between new immigrant communities and crime dynamics. The study critically examines how contemporary ethnographies can illuminate the socio-cultural and economic factors influencing immigrant interactions with crime, both as victims and perpetrators. Through in-depth case studies and participant observations, the research highlights the diverse experiences of new immigrants, challenging prevailing stereotypes and offering insights into their adaptive strategies within urban environments. This revitalization of ethnographic approaches seeks to contribute to a more comprehensive discourse on immigration and crime, advocating for policies that are informed by the lived realities of immigrant populations. Ultimately, the study underscores the importance of context-specific analyses in shaping effective and equitable immigration policies."}
