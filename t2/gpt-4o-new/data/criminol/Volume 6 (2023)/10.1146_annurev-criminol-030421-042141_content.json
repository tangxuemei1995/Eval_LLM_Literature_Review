{"Abstract": "Carjacking, a violent form of robbery involving the theft of a vehicle, has emerged as a significant concern in urban crime trends. This study examines the scope, structure, and process of carjacking incidents using data from the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). By analyzing patterns of victimization and offender profiles, the research identifies key factors influencing crime decision-making in carjacking scenarios. The study reveals that carjackings are often opportunistic, with offenders targeting victims based on perceived vulnerability and vehicle desirability. The analysis also highlights the role of environmental and situational factors in facilitating these crimes. Furthermore, the research explores effective prevention strategies, emphasizing the importance of community awareness, law enforcement training, and technological interventions in reducing carjacking incidents. By providing a comprehensive understanding of carjacking dynamics, this study aims to inform policymakers and law enforcement agencies in developing targeted measures to mitigate this pervasive crime and enhance public safety."}
