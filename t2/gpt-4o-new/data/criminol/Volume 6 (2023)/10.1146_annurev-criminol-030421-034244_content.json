{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex interplay between police unionism and accountability mechanisms in the context of police misconduct. Police unions, through collective bargaining agreements and the enforcement of Law Enforcement Bills of Rights, often provide protections that can impede accountability processes. These protections may include limitations on the investigation and discipline of officers, which can contribute to a culture of impunity and hinder efforts to address misconduct, including excessive use of force. The research analyzes the impact of union-negotiated provisions on the transparency and effectiveness of accountability systems within law enforcement agencies. By reviewing case studies and empirical data, the study highlights the challenges and potential reforms necessary to balance the rights of officers with the need for public accountability. The findings suggest that while police unions play a crucial role in advocating for officers' rights, there is a pressing need for policy reforms to ensure that accountability measures are not undermined."}
