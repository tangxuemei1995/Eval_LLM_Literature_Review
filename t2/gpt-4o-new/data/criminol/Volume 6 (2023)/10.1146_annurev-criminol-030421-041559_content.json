{"Abstract": "This study examines the evolving trends in women's incarceration rates in the United States, highlighting the underlying inequalities and broader implications of mass incarceration. Over recent decades, the number of incarcerated women has surged, outpacing the growth rate of male incarceration. This trend is driven by a complex interplay of factors, including punitive policies, socio-economic disparities, and systemic biases within the criminal justice system. The research underscores the disproportionate impact on marginalized communities, particularly women of color, who face heightened vulnerabilities and harsher sentencing. The consequences of incarceration extend beyond the prison walls, affecting familial structures, economic stability, and community cohesion. By analyzing data from various correctional facilities, this study aims to illuminate the multifaceted nature of women's incarceration and advocate for policy reforms that address these entrenched inequalities. The findings call for a reevaluation of punitive approaches and the implementation of more equitable and rehabilitative justice practices."}
