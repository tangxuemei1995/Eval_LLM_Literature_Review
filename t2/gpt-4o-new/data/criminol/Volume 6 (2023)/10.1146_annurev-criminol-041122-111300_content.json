{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between trauma and the reentry process for individuals transitioning from incarceration back into society. It examines how past traumatic experiences, often exacerbated by the prison environment, impact behavioral health and contribute to recidivism. By analyzing current reform initiatives, the research highlights the necessity of integrating trauma-informed care into reentry programs to enhance their effectiveness. The study draws on a comprehensive review of literature and case studies to identify key factors that influence successful reintegration. Findings suggest that addressing trauma through targeted interventions can significantly reduce recidivism rates and improve overall outcomes for formerly incarcerated individuals. The research underscores the importance of a holistic approach to reentry that prioritizes mental health and supports sustainable reintegration into the community."}
