{"Abstract": "This study examines the evolution and dynamics of far-right and jihadi terrorism within the United States from the September 11th attacks in 2001 to the January 6th Capitol insurrection in 2021. Utilizing a comprehensive analysis of hate crimes, extremist activities, and terrorist incidents, this research delineates the ideological, operational, and strategic differences and similarities between far-right and jihadi extremist groups. The findings reveal a significant shift in the domestic terrorism landscape, with far-right extremism increasingly surpassing jihadi terrorism in frequency and impact. The study highlights the role of social media and online platforms in radicalizing individuals and facilitating the organization of extremist activities. Furthermore, it explores the socio-political factors contributing to the rise of far-right extremism, including economic disenfranchisement, political polarization, and the mainstreaming of extremist rhetoric. The research underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of the motivations and methods of these groups to inform effective counter-terrorism strategies. By comparing the trajectories of these two forms of extremism, the study provides insights into the broader implications for national security and the challenges of addressing domestic terrorism in a rapidly changing socio-political environment."}
