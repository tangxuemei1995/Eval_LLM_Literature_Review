{"Abstract": "The rapid advancement of surveillance technologies has significantly impacted the landscape of constitutional law, particularly concerning the Fourth Amendment, which guards against unreasonable searches and seizures. This study examines the intersection of modern surveillance tools and constitutional protections, analyzing how emerging technologies challenge traditional legal frameworks. By exploring case law and statutory developments, the research highlights the tension between law enforcement's use of surveillance to combat crime and the preservation of individual privacy rights. The paper discusses key judicial interpretations and legislative responses that attempt to balance these competing interests. It also considers the implications of technologies such as facial recognition, drones, and data mining on privacy rights. The findings suggest a need for updated legal standards that adequately address the complexities introduced by technological advancements, ensuring that constitutional protections remain robust in the digital age."}
