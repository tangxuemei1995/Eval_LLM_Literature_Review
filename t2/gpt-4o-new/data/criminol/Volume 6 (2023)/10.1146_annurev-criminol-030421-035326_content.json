{"Abstract": "This study explores the concept of expanded criminal defense lawyering, emphasizing the integration of holistic defense strategies to enhance the effectiveness of counsel for indigent defendants. Traditional defense counsel often focuses narrowly on legal representation, potentially neglecting broader social and economic factors that influence client outcomes. Holistic defense, by contrast, addresses these factors by incorporating social services, mental health support, and community resources into the defense strategy. This approach aims to provide more comprehensive and effective assistance of counsel, thereby upholding the constitutional right to counsel and mitigating the systemic issues contributing to mass incarceration. The research examines case studies and empirical data to assess the impact of holistic defense on case outcomes, recidivism rates, and client satisfaction. Findings suggest that expanded defense strategies can significantly improve legal and social outcomes for defendants, advocating for policy reforms to support the widespread adoption of holistic defense models in indigent defense systems."}
