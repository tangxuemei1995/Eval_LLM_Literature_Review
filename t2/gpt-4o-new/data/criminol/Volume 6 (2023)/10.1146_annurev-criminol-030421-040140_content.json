{"Abstract": "The opioid crisis has emerged as a critical public health challenge, drawing parallels to the crack epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s, yet revealing stark differences in societal and policy responses. This study examines the evolution of the 'War on Drugs' in the context of the opioid epidemic, highlighting the racial and socio-political dynamics that have shaped drug policy and treatment approaches. Historically, drug policies have disproportionately targeted minority communities, as seen during the crack epidemic, leading to mass incarceration and systemic inequities. In contrast, the opioid crisis, predominantly affecting white populations, has prompted a shift towards public health-oriented strategies, including increased access to drug treatment and harm reduction services. This paper critically analyzes the implications of these divergent responses, questioning the role of race in shaping drug policy and the potential for equitable reform. By exploring the intersections of race, policy, and public health, this research underscores the need for a comprehensive and inclusive approach to drug policy that addresses the root causes of addiction and prioritizes treatment over criminalization. The findings suggest that while the 'War on Drugs' may be evolving, its legacy continues to influence contemporary drug policy, necessitating ongoing advocacy for systemic change."}
