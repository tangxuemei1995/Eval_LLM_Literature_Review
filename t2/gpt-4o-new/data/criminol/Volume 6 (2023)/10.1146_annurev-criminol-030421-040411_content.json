{"Abstract": "The phenomenon of overcriminalization has garnered significant attention in contemporary legal discourse, raising critical questions about the scope and implications of criminal law. This paper explores six pivotal questions that underpin the debate on overcriminalization, focusing on the interplay between criminalization, discretion, harm, punishment, enforcement, offenses, and defenses. First, it examines the criteria for determining which behaviors should be criminalized, emphasizing the role of harm as a fundamental consideration. Second, the paper investigates the extent of discretion afforded to law enforcement and judicial bodies in the application of criminal laws, highlighting potential biases and inconsistencies. Third, it scrutinizes the proportionality of punishment in relation to the severity of offenses, questioning whether current punitive measures align with principles of justice and deterrence. Fourth, the study delves into the enforcement mechanisms of criminal laws, assessing their effectiveness and fairness in practice. Fifth, it evaluates the breadth and specificity of offenses, considering whether the proliferation of criminal statutes dilutes the moral authority of the law. Finally, the paper addresses the availability and adequacy of defenses within the criminal justice system, exploring how they balance the rights of the accused with societal interests. Through a comprehensive analysis of these questions, the paper aims to illuminate the complexities of overcriminalization and propose pathways for reform. By fostering a nuanced understanding of these issues, the study contributes to ongoing efforts to refine criminal law and ensure it serves its intended purpose of protecting society while upholding individual rights."}
