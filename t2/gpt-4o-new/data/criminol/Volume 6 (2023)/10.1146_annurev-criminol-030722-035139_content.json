{"Abstract": "This study provides a comprehensive structural analysis of the current crisis in American criminal justice, focusing on the interconnected phenomena of mass incarceration, police killings, and criminal violence. By examining these issues through the lens of social control and political economy, the research highlights the systemic factors contributing to the perpetuation of these crises. The analysis reveals how the expansion of the criminal justice system has been influenced by broader socio-economic policies, particularly the retrenchment of the welfare state and the prioritization of punitive measures over social support. The study argues that mass incarceration and aggressive policing strategies are not merely responses to crime but are deeply embedded in the political and economic structures that govern American society. Furthermore, the research explores the role of racial and economic disparities in exacerbating these issues, demonstrating how marginalized communities are disproportionately affected. By situating the crisis within the context of neoliberal governance, the study calls for a reevaluation of current policies and advocates for a shift towards a more equitable and rehabilitative approach to justice. This analysis aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on reforming the American criminal justice system."}
