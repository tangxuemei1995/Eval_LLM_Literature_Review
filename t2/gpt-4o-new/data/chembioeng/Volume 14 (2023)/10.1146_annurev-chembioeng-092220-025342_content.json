{"Abstract": "This study explores the integration of machine learning techniques with traditional physical models to enhance the thermodynamic modeling of fluid mixtures. By leveraging the predictive power of machine learning, we aim to address the limitations of conventional models in capturing complex interactions within fluid mixtures. The proposed hybrid model combines data-driven insights with established thermodynamic principles, offering improved accuracy and computational efficiency. We evaluate the model's performance on various fluid systems, demonstrating its capability to predict thermodynamic properties with higher precision than standalone approaches. This research highlights the potential of hybrid models in advancing the understanding and prediction of fluid mixture behaviors, paving the way for more robust and versatile thermodynamic applications."}
