{"Abstract": "The rapid evolution of pathogens poses significant challenges to traditional vaccine development and passive immunization strategies. Antibody engineering emerges as a promising approach to outsmart these adaptive threats. This review explores recent advancements in antibody engineering, focusing on Fc engineering, bispecific antibodies, and antibody–drug conjugates. Fc engineering enhances antibody efficacy by improving immune system engagement and extending half-life, while bispecific antibodies offer targeted pathogen neutralization by simultaneously binding to two distinct antigens. Antibody–drug conjugates provide a dual mechanism of action, combining specific pathogen targeting with potent therapeutic payloads. These innovations address immune evasion tactics employed by pathogens, offering a versatile toolkit for combating infectious diseases. By integrating these engineered antibodies into existing immunization frameworks, we can enhance the breadth and durability of immune protection, paving the way for more effective and adaptable therapeutic interventions against evolving pathogens."}
