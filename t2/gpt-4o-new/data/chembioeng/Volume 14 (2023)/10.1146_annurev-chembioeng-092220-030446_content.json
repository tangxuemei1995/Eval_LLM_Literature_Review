{"Abstract": "The transition to a net-zero emission energy system necessitates a pivotal role for international oil companies (IOCs) in reshaping the global energy landscape. This study explores the multifaceted contributions of IOCs in advancing energy carriers, transport, and storage technologies, emphasizing their potential to enhance energy density and efficiency. By leveraging their extensive infrastructure and expertise, IOCs can facilitate the integration of renewable energy sources and the development of low-carbon technologies. The research highlights strategic investments and innovations by IOCs in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), hydrogen production, and bioenergy, which are critical for achieving net-zero targets. Furthermore, the study examines the challenges and opportunities faced by IOCs in aligning their business models with sustainable practices, underscoring the importance of policy frameworks and stakeholder collaboration in driving the energy transition."}
