{"Abstract": "Nonconjugated redox-active polymers (NRAPs) have emerged as promising materials for energy storage applications due to their unique electron transfer mechanisms and chemical versatility. Unlike conjugated polymers, NRAPs facilitate electron transfer through localized redox sites, offering distinct advantages in terms of tunable conductivity and enhanced stability. This review explores the electron transfer kinetics within NRAPs, highlighting their potential to improve battery performance by enabling rapid charge-discharge cycles and high energy densities. The chemical versatility of NRAPs allows for the incorporation of various functional groups, enhancing their redox activity and enabling the design of tailored materials for specific applications. By examining recent advancements in the synthesis and characterization of NRAPs, this study underscores their potential to revolutionize the field of energy storage, paving the way for the development of next-generation batteries with improved efficiency and sustainability."}
