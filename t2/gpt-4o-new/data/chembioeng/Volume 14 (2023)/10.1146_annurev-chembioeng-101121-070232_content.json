{"Abstract": "Peptide-based vectors have emerged as a promising biomolecular engineering strategy for gene delivery, offering a versatile platform for the transport of nucleic acids such as silencing RNA (siRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA), and other oligonucleotides. These vectors leverage intracellular targeting peptides to enhance cellular uptake and ensure precise delivery to target sites, addressing key challenges in gene therapy. The ability of these peptides to facilitate endosomal escape is critical for the successful release of genetic material into the cytoplasm, thereby improving therapeutic efficacy. Recent advancements have demonstrated the potential of peptide-based vectors in preclinical models, with several candidates advancing to clinical trials. This review highlights the design principles, functional mechanisms, and therapeutic applications of peptide-based vectors, emphasizing their role in overcoming biological barriers to gene delivery. The integration of these vectors into gene therapy protocols holds significant promise for the treatment of a wide range of genetic disorders, paving the way for innovative therapeutic interventions."}
