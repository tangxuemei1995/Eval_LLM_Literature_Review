{"Abstract": "The transition from laboratory-scale photochemical reactions to industrial production presents unique challenges and opportunities. This study explores methodologies for scaling up photochemical processes, focusing on photocatalysis and flow chemistry. Key strategies include numbering up and sizing up, which are critical for maintaining reaction efficiency and product quality. The research highlights the importance of reactor design, light source optimization, and process control in achieving successful scale-up. Case studies demonstrate the potential for industrial applications, emphasizing the role of innovative technologies in overcoming scalability barriers. This work provides a framework for advancing photochemical processes from bench to production scale."}
