{"Abstract": "RNAs play a crucial role in bacterial stress response by acting as sensors of oxidative stress, a condition characterized by an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defenses. This study explores the mechanisms by which RNA molecules detect and respond to oxidative stress, focusing on RNA oxidation and its impact on bacterial physiology. The research highlights the potential of RNA sensors in synthetic biology applications, where engineered RNA molecules could be used to monitor and mitigate oxidative damage. Understanding RNA's role in oxidative stress response not only provides insights into bacterial survival strategies but also opens avenues for developing novel biotechnological tools to enhance microbial resilience and productivity in industrial settings."}
