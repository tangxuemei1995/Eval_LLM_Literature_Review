{"Abstract": "Active colloids, as a subset of active matter, have emerged as a versatile platform for exploring nonequilibrium phenomena, offering insights into both fundamental physics and practical applications. These self-propelled particles exhibit complex behaviors that arise from their intrinsic activity, leading to novel collective dynamics and pattern formation. As models, active colloids provide a controllable system to study the principles governing nonequilibrium systems, shedding light on processes such as energy dissipation and entropy production. As materials, they enable the design of responsive and adaptive structures with potential applications in drug delivery, environmental sensing, and smart materials. Furthermore, as machines, active colloids can be engineered to perform specific tasks, harnessing their autonomous motion for micro- and nanoscale operations. This review highlights recent advances in the understanding and utilization of active colloids, emphasizing their role as a bridge between theoretical models and real-world applications."}
