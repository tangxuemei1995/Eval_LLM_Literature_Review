{"Abstract": "The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) is a promising approach for sustainable fuel production, yet understanding the underlying mechanisms remains challenging. This study reviews advanced in situ/operando characterization techniques that provide mechanistic insights into CO2 electroreduction. Emphasis is placed on the role of catalysts and electrolytes in influencing reaction pathways and intermediates. Techniques such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy are highlighted for their ability to monitor dynamic changes in catalyst structure and surface chemistry. These insights are crucial for optimizing catalyst design and improving the efficiency and selectivity of CO2 reduction processes."}
