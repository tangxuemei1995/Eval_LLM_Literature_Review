{"Abstract": "Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have emerged as a promising class of green solvents, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional solvents due to their low toxicity, biodegradability, and ease of preparation. This review delves into the fundamental aspects of DESs, focusing on their formation through hydrogen bonding interactions and the resulting depression in melting temperatures, which facilitates the creation of eutectic mixtures. The solidâ€“liquid equilibrium of these mixtures is crucial for understanding their physicochemical properties and potential applications. By examining the role of hydrogen bonding in the stabilization of DESs, this study highlights the versatility of these solvents in various fields, including catalysis, extraction, and material synthesis. The review also addresses common misconceptions and challenges associated with DESs, providing a comprehensive overview for researchers interested in harnessing their potential in green chemistry. Through this exploration, the study aims to demystify DESs and encourage their broader adoption in sustainable practices."}
