{"Abstract": "The study of drying drops of colloidal dispersions is crucial for understanding the formation of evaporative patterns and the dynamics of evaporation-driven flows. This research investigates the behavior of sessile drop evaporation in complex fluids, focusing on the interplay between fluid dynamics and particle interactions. By examining the drying process in various configurations, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms governing pattern formation and flow dynamics. Our findings reveal that the evaporation rate, particle concentration, and substrate properties significantly influence the resulting patterns. This work provides insights into the fundamental processes of drying in complex systems, with implications for applications in coatings, inkjet printing, and material science."}
