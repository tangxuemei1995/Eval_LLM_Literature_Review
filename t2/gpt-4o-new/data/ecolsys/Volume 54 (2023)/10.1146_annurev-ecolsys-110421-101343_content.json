{"Abstract": "Conservation paleobiology offers a unique perspective on the ecology of terrestrial communities by examining fossil records to understand past biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics. This approach provides critical insights into how ecosystems have historically responded to environmental stressors, offering valuable lessons for managing current and future biodiversity challenges in the Anthropocene. By analyzing fossil data, researchers can identify patterns of resilience and vulnerability in past ecosystems, informing strategies to mitigate the impacts of modern anthropogenic pressures. This study synthesizes paleobiological findings to highlight the importance of historical baselines in conservation efforts, emphasizing the need to integrate long-term ecological data into contemporary biodiversity management. The research underscores the potential of conservation paleobiology to enhance our understanding of ecosystem responses to environmental changes, ultimately guiding more effective conservation practices in an era of unprecedented ecological transformation."}
