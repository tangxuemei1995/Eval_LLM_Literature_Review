{"Abstract": "Large Old World fruit bats, particularly those of the genus Pteropus, are facing an alarming risk of extinction due to a confluence of anthropogenic and environmental factors. These keystone species, commonly known as flying foxes, play a critical role in island ecosystems through pollination and seed dispersal. However, their populations are severely threatened by unsustainable hunting practices, habitat destruction, and the escalating impacts of climate change. The loss of these bats could lead to significant ecological consequences, including the disruption of plant regeneration and biodiversity loss. Conservation efforts are urgently needed to address these threats, with a focus on habitat protection, sustainable hunting regulations, and climate adaptation strategies. This study underscores the importance of island conservation initiatives and highlights the need for global awareness and action to preserve these vital species and the ecosystems they support."}
