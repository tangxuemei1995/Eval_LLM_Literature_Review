{"Abstract": "Cetaceans, the largest marine predators, exhibit remarkable adaptations for diving and foraging, driven by ecophysiological constraints and evolutionary pressures. This study explores the interplay between body size, scaling, and gigantism in cetaceans, examining how these factors influence their diving capabilities and foraging strategies. By analyzing the physiological limits of oxygen storage and utilization, we elucidate the mechanisms enabling prolonged dives and efficient prey capture. The research highlights the role of predator-prey dynamics in shaping the evolution of cetacean gigantism, where larger body sizes confer advantages in energy storage and thermal regulation, yet impose challenges in maneuverability and prey detection. Our findings underscore the delicate balance between the energetic demands of foraging and the physiological limits of diving, offering insights into the evolutionary pathways that have led to the diverse foraging strategies observed in modern cetaceans."}
