{"Abstract": "Pleiotropy, the phenomenon where a single gene influences multiple phenotypic traits, plays a critical role in evolutionary biology. This study explores the patterns and evolutionary consequences of pleiotropy, focusing on its implications for adaptation and the cost of complexity. Through a comprehensive review of genetic and phenotypic data, we examine how pleiotropy can lead to antagonistic effects, where beneficial mutations for one trait may be detrimental to others. This antagonistic pleiotropy is particularly relevant in the context of disease, where mutations that confer resistance to pathogens may simultaneously increase susceptibility to other conditions. Our findings suggest that pleiotropy can constrain evolutionary trajectories by limiting the range of adaptive mutations, thereby influencing the pace and direction of evolution. Additionally, the study highlights the cost of complexity, where organisms with highly interconnected genetic networks may face greater challenges in adapting to environmental changes. These insights underscore the importance of pleiotropy in shaping evolutionary outcomes and biodiversity."}
