{"Abstract": "Phosphorus (P) is a critical nutrient influencing terrestrial ecosystem productivity, yet its cycling is sensitive to climatic changes. This study investigates the responses of P cycling across diverse biomes, including forests, grasslands, and tundra, under varying climatic conditions. Utilizing a combination of ecosystem models and field experiments, we assess how shifts in temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric CO2 levels impact P availability and limitation. Our findings indicate that warming accelerates P mineralization in forest and grassland soils, potentially alleviating P limitation, whereas tundra ecosystems exhibit increased P immobilization due to altered microbial activity. Experimental data corroborate model predictions, highlighting biome-specific responses and feedbacks in P cycling. These insights underscore the necessity for adaptive management strategies to mitigate nutrient limitation in the face of climate change. Our research contributes to a deeper understanding of nutrient dynamics, informing conservation efforts and sustainable land-use practices in a rapidly changing world."}
