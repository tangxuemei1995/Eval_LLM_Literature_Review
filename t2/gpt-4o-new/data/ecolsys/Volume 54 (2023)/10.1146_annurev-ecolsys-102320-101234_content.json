{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has provided unprecedented insights into the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of emerging infectious diseases. This study examines the interplay between respiratory infections, zoonotic spillover events, and the evolution of virulence, highlighting the critical role of social behavior in disease transmission and control. The rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 underscores the importance of understanding zoonotic pathways and the conditions that facilitate spillover from wildlife to humans. Evolutionary pressures on the virus, driven by host immune responses and public health interventions, have led to the emergence of variants with altered transmissibility and virulence. Social behavior, including mobility patterns and adherence to control measures, significantly influences disease dynamics and the effectiveness of interventions. This research emphasizes the need for integrated approaches combining ecological, evolutionary, and social perspectives to predict and mitigate future pandemics. By learning from COVID-19, we can enhance our preparedness for emerging infectious diseases, ultimately reducing their impact on global health."}
