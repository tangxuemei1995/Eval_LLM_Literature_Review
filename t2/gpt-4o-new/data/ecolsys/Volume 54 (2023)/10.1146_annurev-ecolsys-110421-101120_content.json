{"Abstract": "This study explores the impact of novel disturbance regimes on ecological systems, focusing on resilience, recovery, and succession processes. By examining response traits and thresholds, we aim to understand how ecosystems adapt to unprecedented disturbances, such as climate change and anthropogenic pressures. Our research highlights the importance of adaptive management strategies in fostering ecosystem resilience and facilitating recovery. We analyze case studies across diverse biomes to identify patterns in ecological responses and the role of species-specific traits in determining recovery trajectories. The findings suggest that ecosystems with high functional diversity and adaptive capacity are better equipped to withstand and recover from novel disturbances. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of crossing ecological thresholds, which may lead to irreversible changes in ecosystem structure and function. This research underscores the necessity for proactive management approaches that incorporate ecological thresholds and response traits to enhance ecosystem resilience in the face of increasing environmental variability."}
