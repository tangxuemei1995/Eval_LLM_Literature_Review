{"Abstract": "Marine ecosystems are increasingly impacted by climate change, with both gradual shifts in mean conditions and abrupt events like heatwaves posing significant threats. This study explores the dual role of variability—both smooth and spiky—in shaping ecological responses to these changes. We examine how variability influences species' acclimation processes and the potential for depth refuges to mitigate impacts. Our findings highlight the importance of considering both mean changes and variability in predicting ecological outcomes. We also investigate legacy effects, where past exposure to variable conditions affects future resilience. By integrating these factors, we provide a more comprehensive understanding of marine species' adaptive capacities. This research underscores the need for conservation strategies that account for the complex interplay between mean conditions and variability, offering insights into enhancing ecosystem resilience in the face of ongoing climate change."}
