{"Abstract": "Seed dispersal is a critical ecological process influencing plant population dynamics, community structure, and ecosystem functioning. This study examines the causes and consequences of seed dispersal through the lens of dispersal processes and syndromes, utilizing the generalized gravity framework and movement ecology paradigm. By integrating these theoretical approaches, we explore the 'seedscape'—the spatial and temporal patterns of seed distribution—and assess seed dispersal effectiveness. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between biotic and abiotic factors driving dispersal mechanisms and their subsequent impact on plant fitness and biodiversity. Understanding these dynamics is essential for predicting plant responses to environmental changes and for the development of conservation strategies aimed at preserving ecological resilience and function."}
