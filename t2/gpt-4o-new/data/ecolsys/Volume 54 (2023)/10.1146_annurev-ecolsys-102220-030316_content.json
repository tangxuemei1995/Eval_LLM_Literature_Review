{"Abstract": "The study of background acoustics in terrestrial ecology is pivotal for understanding the complex interactions within ecological communities. This research explores how ambient soundscapes influence animal behavior and community dynamics through both direct and indirect effects. Direct effects include the impact of acoustic environments on animal hearing and communication, where masking by background noise can alter predator-prey interactions and mating calls. Indirectly, soundscapes can affect habitat selection and resource availability, thereby influencing community structure and species distribution. By integrating concepts from behavior and community ecology, this study highlights the importance of acoustic environments in shaping ecological interactions. The findings underscore the need for conservation strategies that consider acoustic habitats, especially in the face of increasing anthropogenic noise. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of how soundscapes function as a critical component of terrestrial ecosystems, affecting biodiversity and ecological resilience."}
