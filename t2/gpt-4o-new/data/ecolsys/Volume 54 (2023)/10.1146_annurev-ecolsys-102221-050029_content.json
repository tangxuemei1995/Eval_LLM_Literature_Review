{"Abstract": "Sky islands, isolated mountain ecosystems surrounded by radically different lowland environments, serve as natural laboratories for studying the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. These unique habitats provide insights into ecological and evolutionary processes due to their distinct environmental gradients and isolated populations. As climate change alters temperature and precipitation patterns, sky islands offer a predictive model for understanding species' responses, including shifts in distribution, genetic variation, and convergent evolution. Relict populations on sky islands, which have persisted through past climatic fluctuations, are particularly valuable for examining the resilience and adaptability of species. By analyzing genetic variation within and between these populations, researchers can infer potential evolutionary trajectories and identify conservation priorities. This study underscores the importance of sky islands as a global tool for predicting the ecological and evolutionary consequences of climate change, highlighting their role in informing conservation strategies and enhancing our understanding of biodiversity dynamics in a rapidly changing world."}
