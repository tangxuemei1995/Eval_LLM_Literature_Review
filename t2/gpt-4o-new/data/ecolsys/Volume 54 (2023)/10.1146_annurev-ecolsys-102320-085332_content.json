{"Abstract": "Deep soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, acting as a significant carbon sink. This study investigates the response of deep SOC to global change factors, including climate change, elevated atmospheric CO2 levels, and land use and land cover changes. Through a comprehensive review of recent literature and meta-analyses, we assess the mechanisms by which these factors influence deep SOC dynamics. Our findings indicate that elevated CO2 can enhance root biomass and exudation, potentially increasing deep SOC storage. However, climate change, particularly rising temperatures, may accelerate SOC decomposition, offsetting these gains. Land use changes, such as deforestation and agricultural expansion, significantly disturb deep SOC stocks, often leading to carbon losses. Understanding these interactions is critical for predicting future SOC dynamics and developing strategies to mitigate climate change. This research underscores the need for integrated management practices to preserve deep SOC under changing global conditions."}
