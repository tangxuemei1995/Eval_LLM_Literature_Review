{"Abstract": "Biological invasions pose significant threats to global biodiversity and ecosystem function. This study investigates the functional trait variation of invasive species along their invasion pathways, focusing on the interplay between community ecology, physiology, and phenotypic plasticity. By examining a range of invasive species, often referred to as 'ideal weeds,' we assess how these organisms adapt to new environments and outcompete native species. Our research highlights the role of phenotypic plasticity in facilitating rapid adaptation and successful establishment in diverse ecological contexts. We employ a comparative approach, analyzing trait data across different stages of invasion, from initial introduction to widespread establishment. The findings underscore the importance of understanding trait-environment interactions and their implications for managing invasive species. This study contributes to the broader field of invasion biology by elucidating the mechanisms that underpin the success of invasive species and informing strategies for mitigating their impacts on native communities and ecosystems."}
