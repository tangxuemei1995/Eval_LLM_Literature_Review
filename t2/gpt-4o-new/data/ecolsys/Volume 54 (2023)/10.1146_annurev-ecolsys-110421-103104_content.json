{"Abstract": "South Florida, recognized as the world's most invaded continental ecoregion, presents a unique case study for understanding the dynamics of non-native species introduction, spread, and ecological impact. This research examines the patterns of biological invasions in this region, focusing on the mechanisms of establishment and spread, and the subsequent ecological consequences. Utilizing the empty niche hypothesis, we explore how non-native species exploit available ecological niches, leading to successful establishment and proliferation. The study also evaluates the effectiveness of biological control and eradication efforts, highlighting challenges and successes in managing invasive populations. Our findings underscore the complexity of invasion biology in South Florida, where diverse ecosystems and human activities intersect, facilitating the introduction and spread of non-native species. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of invasion dynamics and informs strategies for mitigating the ecological impacts of invasive species in highly susceptible regions."}
