{"Abstract": "Density-dependent selection is a pivotal concept in evolutionary biology, influencing population dynamics and species adaptation. This study explores the interplay between age structure and density-dependent selection, examining how these factors shape norms of reaction and contribute to population regulation. By integrating theoretical models with empirical data, we investigate the differential impacts of r-selection and K-selection strategies under varying population densities. Our findings suggest that age structure significantly modulates the effects of density-dependent selection, with younger populations exhibiting more pronounced r-selection traits, such as rapid reproduction and high dispersal rates, while older populations tend towards K-selection characteristics, including enhanced competitive abilities and resource efficiency. These dynamics underscore the importance of considering age structure in ecological and evolutionary studies, as it influences the adaptive strategies populations employ in response to environmental pressures. This research provides insights into the mechanisms of population regulation and the evolutionary trajectories of species in fluctuating environments."}
