{"Abstract": "Urban pollination ecology is an emerging field that examines the complex interactions between pollinators and urban environments. Cities, with their unique landscapes and fragmented habitats, present both challenges and opportunities for pollinator species. This study explores the mutualistic relationships between urban flora and pollinators, emphasizing the role of dispersal and connectivity in maintaining these interactions. Urban areas often disrupt traditional pollination networks, yet they can also foster novel connections and enhance biodiversity through green spaces and urban gardens. The research highlights the importance of understanding how urbanization affects pollinator behavior and plant-pollinator networks, which are crucial for ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. By analyzing the spatial distribution and movement patterns of pollinators in urban settings, this study provides insights into the resilience and adaptability of these species. The findings underscore the need for urban planning that incorporates ecological principles to support pollinator populations and ensure sustainable urban ecosystems."}
