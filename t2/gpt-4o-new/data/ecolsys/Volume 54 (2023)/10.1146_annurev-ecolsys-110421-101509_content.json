{"Abstract": "The origin of life remains one of the most profound questions in science, with recent advances suggesting a complex interplay of chemical and environmental factors. This study explores the hypothesis that life itself provides clues to its origins, focusing on key processes such as CO2 fixation and the emergence of protocells. Central to this exploration is the role of metabolism, particularly the proton-motive force and FeS clusters, which may have driven early biochemical pathways. The RNA world hypothesis is revisited, highlighting RNA's dual role as both genetic material and catalyst, potentially bridging the gap between chemistry and biology. Additionally, the evolution of the genetic code is examined as a pivotal step in life's development. By integrating these elements, the research aims to construct a coherent narrative of life's emergence, offering insights into the conditions and processes that may have facilitated the transition from chemistry to biology."}
