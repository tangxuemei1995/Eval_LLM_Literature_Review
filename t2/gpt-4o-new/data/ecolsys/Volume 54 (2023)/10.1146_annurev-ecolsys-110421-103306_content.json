{"Abstract": "The study of Anolis lizards has long provided critical insights into evolutionary biology, particularly in the context of adaptive radiation and ecological diversification. This research synthesizes recent findings on Anolis species, emphasizing their evolutionary trajectories in the Caribbean. By integrating ecological, genetic, and morphological data, we explore how these lizards have adapted to diverse habitats, offering a model for understanding speciation and niche differentiation. The study highlights the role of environmental pressures and interspecific interactions in shaping phenotypic diversity. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the Anthropocene on Anolis populations, considering habitat alteration and climate change as significant factors influencing their evolutionary pathways. Our findings underscore the importance of Anolis lizards as a model system for studying evolutionary processes and provide a framework for future research on biodiversity conservation in rapidly changing environments. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of how species adapt and evolve in response to both natural and anthropogenic challenges."}
