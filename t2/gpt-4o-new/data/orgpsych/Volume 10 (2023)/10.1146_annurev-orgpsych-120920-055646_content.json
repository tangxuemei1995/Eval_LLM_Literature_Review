{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate psychological processes underpinning entrepreneurship, focusing on action theory, bricolage, cognition, motivation, effectuation, and emotion. By integrating these diverse psychological constructs, the research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how entrepreneurs navigate complex and uncertain environments. Action theory is examined to understand decision-making and behavior in entrepreneurial contexts, while bricolage highlights resourcefulness and innovation. Cognition and motivation are analyzed to reveal how mental processes and intrinsic drives influence entrepreneurial actions. Effectuation is discussed as a strategic approach that entrepreneurs use to control unpredictable futures. Additionally, the role of emotion is considered, emphasizing its impact on entrepreneurial resilience and adaptability. This multifaceted analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of the psychological dimensions that drive entrepreneurial success and offers insights for fostering entrepreneurial mindsets and practices."}
