{"Abstract": "The integrity of organizational research is heavily reliant on the quality of the samples used. Recent innovations in sampling techniques have sought to address persistent challenges such as insufficient effort responding and participant dishonesty, which can compromise data quality. This paper reviews contemporary advancements in sampling methodologies, particularly in the context of online samples, which have become increasingly prevalent. We explore novel approaches that enhance the appropriateness and reliability of samples, including adaptive sampling strategies and the integration of machine learning algorithms to identify and mitigate low-quality responses. Additionally, we discuss the role of pre-screening and post-survey validation techniques in ensuring participant authenticity and engagement. By leveraging these innovations, researchers can significantly improve the robustness of their findings, thereby advancing the field of organizational research. The paper concludes with recommendations for best practices in sampling, emphasizing the importance of continuous methodological refinement to keep pace with evolving digital landscapes and participant behaviors. These insights are crucial for researchers aiming to produce high-quality, generalizable results in organizational studies."}
