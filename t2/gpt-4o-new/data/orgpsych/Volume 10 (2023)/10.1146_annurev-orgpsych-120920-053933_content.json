{"Abstract": "Over the past decade, the Job Demandsâ€“Resources (JD-R) theory has significantly advanced our understanding of occupational well-being, particularly in relation to burnout and work engagement. This paper revisits the JD-R model, highlighting its evolution and application in diverse work settings. The theory posits that job demands, such as workload and emotional stress, can lead to burnout, while job resources, including support and autonomy, foster work engagement. Recent research underscores the role of proactive work behavior in mitigating job demands and enhancing job resources, thus promoting a healthier work environment. Furthermore, the integration of job design principles within the JD-R framework has provided new insights into optimizing employee performance and satisfaction. This review synthesizes key findings and suggests future research directions to further refine the JD-R model in the context of contemporary work challenges."}
