{"Abstract": "Self-reflection at work is a critical process that can enhance leadership, emotion regulation, and overall job performance. This study explores the dual nature of self-reflection, distinguishing between constructive reflection and detrimental rumination. By employing distancing techniques, individuals can harness the benefits of self-reflection, such as improved decision-making and emotional intelligence, while avoiding the pitfalls of excessive rumination that can lead to stress and decreased productivity. The research highlights strategies for effective self-reflection, emphasizing the importance of structured reflection practices and supportive organizational cultures. The findings suggest that when properly managed, self-reflection can be a powerful tool for personal and professional growth, fostering a more adaptive and resilient workforce."}
