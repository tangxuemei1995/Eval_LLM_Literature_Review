{"Abstract": "Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) has become a cornerstone in organizational research, offering a robust framework for testing complex theoretical models involving latent variables. This paper reviews the current state of SEM, highlighting its widespread application and the methodological advancements that have enhanced model fit and the estimation of latent interactions. Despite its strengths, challenges remain, including issues of model specification, identification, and the interpretation of results. The paper proposes future directions for SEM, emphasizing the need for improved software capabilities, the integration of Bayesian methods, and the development of more sophisticated techniques for handling non-normal data and measurement invariance. By addressing these challenges, SEM can continue to evolve as a powerful tool for organizational researchers, enabling more accurate and insightful analyses of complex phenomena. This work aims to guide researchers in leveraging SEM's full potential while navigating its limitations."}
