{"Abstract": "This review examines the intersection of race and organizational justice, exploring how racioethnic differences influence perceptions and experiences of fairness in the workplace. Drawing on a comprehensive analysis of existing literature, the study investigates whether organizational justice is truly colorblind or if racial and ethnic disparities persist in the distribution of resources, decision-making processes, and interpersonal treatment. The findings suggest that while organizational justice frameworks aim to promote equity, implicit biases and structural inequalities often result in differential outcomes for racioethnic minorities. The review highlights the need for organizations to implement more inclusive policies and practices that address these disparities, fostering a more equitable work environment. Future research directions are proposed to further understand the mechanisms driving these differences and to develop strategies for enhancing justice perceptions across diverse employee groups."}
