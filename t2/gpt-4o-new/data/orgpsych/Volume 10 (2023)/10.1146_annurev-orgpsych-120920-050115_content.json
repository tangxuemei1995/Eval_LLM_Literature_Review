{"Abstract": "The transition to virtual and hybrid work environments has necessitated a reevaluation of leadership strategies. This study explores the dynamics of leading virtually, focusing on the unique challenges and opportunities presented by remote and hybrid teams. By examining dyadic interactions between leaders and team members, the research identifies key competencies required for effective virtual leadership, including communication, trust-building, and adaptability. The findings suggest that successful virtual leaders are those who can foster a sense of connection and engagement despite physical distances. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of leveraging technology to facilitate collaboration and maintain team cohesion. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, this research provides insights into best practices for leading in a virtual context, offering guidance for leaders seeking to navigate the complexities of remote and hybrid work settings effectively."}
