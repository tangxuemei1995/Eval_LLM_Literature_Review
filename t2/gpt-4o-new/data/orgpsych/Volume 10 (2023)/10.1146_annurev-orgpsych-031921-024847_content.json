{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between decent work and meaningful work, two pivotal constructs in the psychology of working. Decent work, as defined by the International Labour Organization, encompasses fair income, security, and social protection, while meaningful work pertains to the personal significance and fulfillment derived from one's job. By examining the intersection of these concepts, this research aims to elucidate how job design and work conditions contribute to the perception of meaningfulness in the workplace. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, the study identifies key factors that enhance or hinder the experience of meaningful work within the framework of decent work. The findings suggest that while decent work provides the foundational conditions necessary for meaningful work, additional elements such as autonomy, purpose, and alignment with personal values are crucial for fostering a truly meaningful work experience. This research underscores the importance of integrating both constructs to enhance employee well-being and productivity."}
