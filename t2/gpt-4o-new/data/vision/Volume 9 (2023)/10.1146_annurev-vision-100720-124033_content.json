{"Abstract": "This study investigates the cerebral cortex's involvement in visual search by examining rhesus monkeys' responses to natural scenes. By analyzing saccadic eye movements, we aim to elucidate the roles of the visual cortex and frontal eye field in processing complex visual stimuli. Our findings suggest that natural scenes provide a more ecologically valid context for understanding cortical mechanisms compared to artificial stimuli. The results highlight the intricate interplay between different cortical areas in guiding visual attention and decision-making processes. This research advances our comprehension of the cerebral cortex's functional architecture, offering insights into the neural basis of visual search behaviors in primates."}
