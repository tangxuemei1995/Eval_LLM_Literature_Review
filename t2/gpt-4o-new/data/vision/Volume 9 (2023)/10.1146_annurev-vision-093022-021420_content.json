{"Abstract": "Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a complex disease characterized by abnormal retinal vascularization in premature infants. This review explores the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying ROP, focusing on oxygen-induced retinopathy and its impact on angiogenesis. Disruption in maternalâ€“fetal interactions and the role of growth factors, such as VEGF, are critical in the disease's progression. Altered cell signaling pathways contribute to aberrant vascular development, leading to potential retinal detachment and vision loss. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted therapies. Recent advances in molecular biology have shed light on the intricate balance of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors, offering new insights into potential interventions to prevent or mitigate the effects of ROP."}
