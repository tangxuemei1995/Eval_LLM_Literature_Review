{"Abstract": "Ultra-high field functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers unprecedented insights into human visual cognition by enabling detailed examination of cortical and subcortical structures. This study leverages the enhanced spatial resolution of ultra-high field fMRI to investigate the functional organization of cortical layers and columnar structures involved in visual processing. By capturing fine-grained neural activity patterns, we aim to elucidate the intricate mechanisms underlying visual perception and cognition. Our findings demonstrate the potential of ultra-high field imaging to advance our understanding of the visual system, providing a foundation for future research into the neural basis of cognitive functions and the development of novel neuroimaging techniques."}
