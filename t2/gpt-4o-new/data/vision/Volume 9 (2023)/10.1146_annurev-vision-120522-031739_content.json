{"Abstract": "The advent of deep neural networks (DNNs) has revolutionized the field of computer vision, offering unprecedented performance in object recognition tasks. This study investigates the adequacy of DNNs as behavioral models of human visual perception, particularly in the context of visual psychophysics. By comparing the performance of DNNs with human subjects across a range of object recognition tasks, we aim to assess the extent to which these computational models can replicate human perceptual processes. Our analysis reveals that while DNNs excel in recognizing objects under controlled conditions, discrepancies arise in scenarios involving occlusions, noise, and novel viewpoints, where human perception remains robust. Furthermore, we explore the underlying neural mechanisms and architectural differences that contribute to these variations. The findings suggest that although DNNs provide valuable insights into the computational aspects of vision, they fall short of capturing the full complexity of human visual perception. This highlights the need for integrating insights from cognitive neuroscience to enhance the fidelity of DNN-based models."}
