{"Abstract": "The study of visual fixations is pivotal in understanding human attention and perception. This research aims to advance the field by developing a comprehensive framework for predicting visual fixations, integrating insights from eye movements, saliency models, and information theory. We propose a unifying framework that consolidates existing models and introduces a novel taxonomy for categorizing fixation prediction approaches. Our methodology involves a rigorous model comparison, leveraging a diverse set of benchmarks to evaluate performance across different contexts and datasets. By employing transfer learning techniques, we enhance model adaptability and generalization, facilitating the application of fixation prediction models to varied visual environments. The study also explores the role of information theory in quantifying the efficiency and effectiveness of fixation predictions, providing a robust metric for model evaluation. Our findings suggest that a unified approach not only improves prediction accuracy but also offers a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of visual attention. This research contributes to the field by offering a standardized benchmarking protocol and a comprehensive taxonomy, paving the way for future advancements in fixation prediction models. The implications of this work extend to applications in computer vision, human-computer interaction, and cognitive neuroscience."}
