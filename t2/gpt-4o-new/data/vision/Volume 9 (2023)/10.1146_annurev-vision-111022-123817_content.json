{"Abstract": "The primate superior colliculus (SC) plays a pivotal role in the integration of visual information and the coordination of eye movements, essential for active vision and orienting behaviors. This review synthesizes current research on the visual functions of the SC, highlighting its involvement in processing visual stimuli and initiating saccadic eye movements. The SC receives input from various cortical and subcortical regions, enabling it to act as a hub for sensory-motor integration. Recent studies have elucidated the SC's role in attentional shifts and target selection, underscoring its importance in dynamic visual environments. Furthermore, the SC's layered structure facilitates distinct processing pathways, with superficial layers primarily involved in visual processing and deeper layers contributing to motor output. Understanding the SC's functions enhances our comprehension of primate vision and its evolutionary adaptations, offering insights into disorders affecting visual and motor systems. Future research directions include exploring SC plasticity and its interactions with cortical networks."}
