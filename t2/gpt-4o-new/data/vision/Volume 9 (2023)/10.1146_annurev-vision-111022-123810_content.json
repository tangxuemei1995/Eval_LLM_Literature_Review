{"Abstract": "Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that significantly impacts visual function, primarily through its effects on the retina. This review explores the physiological changes in retinal neurons in both human and rodent models, including mice and rats, to understand the mechanisms underlying visual dysfunction in diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy, a common complication, is characterized by alterations in retinal blood vessels and neuronal damage. The study highlights the role of hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in disrupting retinal physiology. Rodent models provide valuable insights into the progression of retinal changes, offering a platform for testing potential therapeutic interventions. Understanding the neuronal and vascular interactions in the diabetic retina is crucial for developing strategies to prevent or mitigate visual impairment in diabetic patients. This research underscores the importance of early detection and management of diabetes to preserve visual function."}
