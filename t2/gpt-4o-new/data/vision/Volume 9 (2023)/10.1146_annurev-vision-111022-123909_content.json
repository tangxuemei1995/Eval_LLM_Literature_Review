{"Abstract": "The preferred retinal locus (PRL) is a critical concept in understanding visual adaptation following central vision loss, such as that caused by macular degeneration. It refers to the area of the retina that individuals use for fixation when the fovea is compromised. This study explores the characteristics and development of PRL, emphasizing its role in maintaining fixation stability and visual function under binocular viewing conditions. By examining the mechanisms behind PRL formation and its impact on visual performance, the research provides insights into rehabilitation strategies for individuals with central vision impairment, aiming to enhance their quality of life through improved visual adaptation."}
