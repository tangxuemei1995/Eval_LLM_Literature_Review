{"Abstract": "The basal ganglia, particularly the striatum and pallidum, play a crucial role in visual perceptual decision-making processes. This study investigates their contributions by examining saccadic choices and reaction times in decision tasks. Utilizing sequential analysis and signal detection theory, we explore how these subcortical structures influence the integration of sensory information and the execution of motor responses. Our findings suggest that the striatum is involved in the accumulation of evidence leading to a decision, while the pallidum modulates the threshold for action initiation. These insights enhance our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying decision-making and have implications for disorders characterized by impaired perceptual decision processes, such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia."}
