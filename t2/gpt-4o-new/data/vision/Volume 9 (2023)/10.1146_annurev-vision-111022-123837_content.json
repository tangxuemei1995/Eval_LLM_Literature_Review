{"Abstract": "The advent of mobile technology has revolutionized the landscape of assistive devices for individuals with visual impairments, offering unprecedented opportunities for enhanced accessibility and independence. This study explores the impact of mobile applications designed as assistive tools for visually impaired persons, focusing on their role in vision rehabilitation and daily life facilitation. Through a comprehensive review of current literature and user feedback, this research identifies key functionalities of these apps, such as object recognition, navigation assistance, and text-to-speech conversion, which significantly contribute to improving the quality of life for users. The study also examines the challenges faced in the adoption and usability of these applications, including issues related to user interface design, device compatibility, and the need for personalized features. Furthermore, the research highlights the importance of collaboration between app developers, healthcare professionals, and end-users to ensure that these digital solutions are both effective and user-friendly. The findings suggest that while mobile apps hold great potential as assistive devices, ongoing advancements in technology and increased awareness are crucial for maximizing their benefits. This study underscores the need for continued innovation and research in the field of mobile accessibility to address the diverse needs of the visually impaired community, ultimately fostering greater inclusion and empowerment. The implications of this research extend to policymakers, developers, and educators aiming to enhance the accessibility and functionality of assistive technologies."}
