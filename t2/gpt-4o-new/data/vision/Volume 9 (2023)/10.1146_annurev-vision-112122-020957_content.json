{"Abstract": "Photoreceptor degenerative disorders, such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration, are leading causes of blindness, characterized by progressive loss of photoreceptors and subsequent retinal remodeling. This study explores strategies to suppress retinal remodeling as a means to mitigate vision loss. By focusing on synaptic plasticity within the retina, we aim to preserve the structural and functional integrity of retinal circuits. Our approach involves the modulation of molecular pathways that govern synaptic connectivity and neuroprotection. Preliminary findings suggest that targeted interventions can stabilize synaptic architecture and delay degenerative processes. This research underscores the potential of therapeutic strategies that go beyond photoreceptor preservation, offering a novel avenue for maintaining visual function in patients with degenerative retinal diseases. Further investigation is warranted to optimize these interventions and assess their long-term efficacy in clinical settings."}
