{"Abstract": "The study of neural coding in vision has revealed a dual role in both efficient information processing and predictive capabilities. This research explores the intersection of efficient coding and prediction within the visual system, employing the information bottleneck framework to elucidate underlying mechanisms. Efficient coding posits that neural systems optimize the representation of sensory inputs by reducing redundancy, thereby conserving metabolic resources. Concurrently, predictive coding suggests that the brain anticipates future sensory inputs, enhancing perceptual accuracy and decision-making. By integrating these paradigms, we propose a unified model that leverages the information bottleneck to balance the trade-off between compression and prediction. Our findings suggest that this dual coding strategy not only optimizes resource allocation but also enhances the system's adaptability to dynamic environments. This work advances our understanding of neural processing, offering insights into the fundamental principles governing sensory information management."}
