{"Abstract": "Nonvisual opsins, traditionally associated with ocular photoreception, are increasingly recognized for their roles in extraocular light sensing, influencing a range of physiological processes. This review explores the expanding functions of these photosensitive proteins beyond the eye, highlighting their involvement in regulating the circadian clock and metabolic pathways. Nonvisual opsins, such as melanopsin, neuropsin, and others, are expressed in various tissues, including the skin, brain, and adipose tissue, where they contribute to light-dependent physiological responses. These opsins mediate photic information that modulates circadian rhythms, thereby impacting sleep-wake cycles, hormonal regulation, and energy homeostasis. Furthermore, recent studies suggest a link between extraocular light perception and metabolic processes, offering insights into how light exposure can influence metabolic health. Understanding the mechanisms by which nonvisual opsins operate in these contexts could lead to novel therapeutic strategies for circadian and metabolic disorders. This review underscores the significance of nonvisual opsins in broadening our comprehension of light's systemic effects."}
