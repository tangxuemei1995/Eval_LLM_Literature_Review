{"Abstract": "The study of visual representations in the brain has advanced significantly through the use of neural decoding and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA). This research explores how these techniques can elucidate the complex neural dynamics underlying object representations. By decoding neural activity patterns, we can infer the representational structure of visual stimuli, providing insights into the internal representations that guide perception and cognition. This paper reviews recent advancements in decoding methodologies, highlighting their ability to capture the nuanced and dynamic nature of neural representations. We discuss how these approaches have been applied to understand the hierarchical organization of visual processing, from low-level feature detection to high-level object recognition. Furthermore, we examine the implications of these findings for theories of neural coding and the potential for developing more sophisticated models of brain function. By integrating insights from neural decoding with traditional neuroimaging techniques, this research contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of how the brain constructs and utilizes visual representations."}
