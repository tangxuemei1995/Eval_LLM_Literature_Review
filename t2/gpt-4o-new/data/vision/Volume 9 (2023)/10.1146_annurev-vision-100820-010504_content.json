{"Abstract": "Emerging pathogenic viral infections pose significant threats to ocular health, with viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and Ebola virus demonstrating notable ophthalmic manifestations. This review explores the mechanisms of viral persistence in ocular tissues and the resultant conditions, including uveitis. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the potential for systemic viral infections to impact eye health, necessitating a deeper understanding of viral pathogenesis in ocular contexts. Similarly, Ebola virus disease has been associated with severe uveitis, underscoring the need for vigilant monitoring and management of eye complications in viral outbreaks. This study emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in diagnosing and treating viral-induced eye diseases, aiming to mitigate long-term visual impairment."}
