{"Abstract": "Retinal degeneration, a leading cause of vision loss, presents a significant challenge for regenerative medicine. Stem cell-based therapies offer promising avenues for restoring retinal function, particularly through the replacement of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), photoreceptors, and ganglion cells. This review examines the critical factors influencing the success of these regenerative approaches, focusing on the role of pluripotent stem cells in generating functional retinal cells. Key challenges include the differentiation efficiency of stem cells into specific retinal cell types, integration and survival of transplanted cells, and the modulation of the immune microenvironment to prevent rejection. Advances in understanding the immune response and developing immunomodulatory strategies are crucial for improving the outcomes of stem cell therapies. This synthesis of current research highlights the potential of stem cell-based interventions in treating retinal degeneration and underscores the need for further studies to optimize these therapeutic strategies."}
