{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between perception and memory within the ventral visual stream and the medial temporal lobe, with a particular focus on the perirhinal cortex. The ventral visual stream is crucial for object recognition, while the medial temporal lobe, including the perirhinal cortex, plays a significant role in memory formation and retrieval. By integrating neuroimaging data and behavioral assessments, we examine how these regions interact to support cognitive processes. Our findings suggest that the perirhinal cortex acts as a critical interface, facilitating the encoding and retrieval of perceptual information into long-term memory. Furthermore, disruptions in this interaction may underlie certain memory disorders. This research enhances our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying perception and memory, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets for cognitive impairments. The study underscores the importance of the perirhinal cortex in bridging perceptual and mnemonic functions, highlighting its role in the seamless integration of sensory experiences into memory."}
