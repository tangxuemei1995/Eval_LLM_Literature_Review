{"Abstract": "Eye morphogenesis in vertebrates is a complex and highly coordinated process that involves the formation of the optic cup, retina, lens, and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). This study explores the intricate cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive the development of these structures. The optic cup, derived from the neural ectoderm, undergoes invagination to form a bilayered structure, giving rise to the neural retina and RPE. Concurrently, the lens placode, originating from the surface ectoderm, invaginates to form the lens vesicle, which subsequently differentiates into the mature lens. Key signaling pathways, including those mediated by fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), and Wnt, play crucial roles in coordinating these morphogenetic events. Understanding the interplay between these pathways provides insights into congenital eye disorders and potential regenerative therapies. This research underscores the importance of precise spatial and temporal regulation in vertebrate eye development."}
