{"Abstract": "Understanding the neuronal mechanisms underlying three-dimensional (3D) vision in nonhuman primates is crucial for elucidating the evolution and functionality of complex visual processing. This study investigates the neural representations that support 3D vision, focusing on stereopsis, perspective, depth perception, orientation, and motion. By employing advanced neuroimaging techniques and electrophysiological recordings, we identify specific brain regions and neuronal circuits involved in processing 3D visual information. Our findings reveal that neurons in the visual cortex exhibit specialized responses to binocular disparity, which is essential for stereopsis, and are finely tuned to detect depth cues and motion parallax. Additionally, we observe that these neurons integrate perspective and orientation information to construct a coherent 3D representation of the environment. These insights enhance our understanding of the neural basis of 3D vision and provide a foundation for further research into visual perception and its applications in artificial intelligence and robotics. This study underscores the complexity and sophistication of primate visual systems."}
