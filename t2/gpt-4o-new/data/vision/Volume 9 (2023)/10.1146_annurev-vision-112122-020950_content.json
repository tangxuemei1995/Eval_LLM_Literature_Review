{"Abstract": "The aging retina undergoes significant structural and functional changes, impacting visual acuity and overall ocular health. This study explores the molecular landscapes that underpin these alterations, focusing on the synaptic and neuronal components of the retina. As the retina ages, synaptic connections between photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and ganglion cells exhibit morphological and functional decline, contributing to impaired signal transmission. Neuronal populations, particularly retinal ganglion cells, experience a reduction in density and synaptic plasticity, which are critical for maintaining visual processing. Molecular analyses reveal age-associated shifts in gene expression and protein profiles, highlighting pathways involved in oxidative stress, inflammation, and cellular senescence. These molecular changes are implicated in the deterioration of synaptic integrity and neuronal function. Understanding the interplay between structural changes and molecular mechanisms in the aging retina is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies to mitigate age-related visual decline. This research underscores the importance of targeting synaptic and neuronal health to preserve retinal function in the aging population."}
