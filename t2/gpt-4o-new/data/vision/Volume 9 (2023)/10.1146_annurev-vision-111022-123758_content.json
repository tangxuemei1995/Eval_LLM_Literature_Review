{"Abstract": "This study explores the perceptual science underlying augmented reality (AR) and its implications for display systems. By integrating digital information with the physical world, AR enhances user interaction and perception. The research examines how visual perception is influenced by AR technologies, focusing on the alignment of virtual and real-world elements. Key factors such as depth perception, spatial awareness, and user interface design are analyzed to optimize AR experiences. The study also addresses challenges in achieving seamless integration and minimizing perceptual discrepancies. Findings suggest that advancements in display systems can significantly enhance the effectiveness of AR applications across various fields, including education, healthcare, and entertainment. This research contributes to the development of more intuitive and immersive AR environments, improving user engagement and satisfaction."}
