{"Abstract": "Long-read DNA sequencing has emerged as a transformative technology in genomics, offering unprecedented insights into complex genomic regions. Recent advances have significantly improved the accuracy and throughput of long-read platforms, enabling more comprehensive detection of structural variants and repetitive DNA sequences that are often missed by short-read technologies. This has profound implications for understanding genomic architecture and its role in disease, particularly in identifying pathogenic mutations that contribute to genetic disorders. Additionally, long-read sequencing facilitates the study of epigenetic modifications, providing a more complete picture of gene regulation and expression. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, including high error rates, cost, and the need for extensive computational resources for data analysis. Ongoing research is focused on overcoming these hurdles to fully realize the potential of long-read sequencing in clinical and research settings. This review highlights the recent technological improvements, applications, and the remaining challenges that need to be addressed to enhance the utility of long-read sequencing in genomics."}
