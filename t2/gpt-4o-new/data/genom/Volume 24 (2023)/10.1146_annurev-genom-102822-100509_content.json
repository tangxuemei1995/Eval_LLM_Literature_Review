{"Abstract": "The DECIPHER project aims to enhance genetic diagnosis by dynamically integrating genomic and clinical data, addressing the challenges of diagnosing rare diseases and genetic disorders. This study explores the potential of combining genotype and phenotype information to improve the accuracy of variant interpretation and establish robust genotypeâ€“phenotype correlations. By leveraging a comprehensive database of genomic variants and associated clinical features, DECIPHER facilitates the identification of pathogenic variants and their clinical significance. The integration of diverse data sources allows for a more nuanced understanding of genetic disorders, enabling personalized diagnostic approaches. Our findings demonstrate that this dynamic integration significantly improves diagnostic yield, particularly in cases with complex phenotypic presentations. Furthermore, the project underscores the importance of collaborative data sharing and the development of standardized protocols for variant interpretation. DECIPHER represents a pivotal step towards precision medicine, offering new insights into the genetic underpinnings of rare diseases and enhancing the overall efficacy of genetic diagnosis."}
