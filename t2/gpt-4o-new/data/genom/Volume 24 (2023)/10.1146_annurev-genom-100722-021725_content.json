{"Abstract": "The rapid advancements in genomics have revolutionized personalized medicine, yet they also present significant legal challenges. This paper explores the evolving landscape of liability and legal responsibilities in genomics, focusing on the duty to warn and data privacy concerns. As genomic data becomes increasingly integral to healthcare, the potential for liability arises from misinterpretation, unauthorized access, and failure to communicate genetic risks. The duty to warn, traditionally applied in clinical settings, now extends to genetic information, necessitating clear guidelines to balance patient confidentiality with the obligation to inform at-risk individuals. Additionally, the protection of genomic data privacy is paramount, given its sensitive nature and potential misuse. This study examines current legal frameworks and proposes strategies for healthcare providers and researchers to navigate these legal land mines, ensuring ethical and legal compliance while fostering innovation in genomics. The findings underscore the need for updated policies that address these emerging challenges."}
