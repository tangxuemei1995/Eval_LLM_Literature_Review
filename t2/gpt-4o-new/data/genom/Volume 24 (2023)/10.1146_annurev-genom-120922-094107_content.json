{"Abstract": "Skeletal dysplasia encompasses a diverse group of disorders characterized by abnormalities in bone and cartilage growth, often resulting in short or tall stature. Central to the pathogenesis of these conditions are the Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-β) and Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathways, which play crucial roles in skeletal development and homeostasis. This review synthesizes current research on the molecular mechanisms by which TGF-β and BMP pathways contribute to skeletal dysplasia. We explore how dysregulation of these pathways can lead to aberrant bone growth, highlighting specific genetic mutations and their phenotypic manifestations. Furthermore, we discuss potential therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways, aiming to correct or mitigate the growth abnormalities associated with skeletal dysplasia. Understanding the intricate balance of TGF-β and BMP signaling is essential for developing effective treatments for patients with stature-related skeletal dysplasias, offering hope for improved clinical outcomes."}
