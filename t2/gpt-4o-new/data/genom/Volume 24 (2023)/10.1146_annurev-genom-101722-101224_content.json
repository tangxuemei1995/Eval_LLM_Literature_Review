{"Abstract": "The study of RNA crossing cellular membranes has unveiled complex systems and mechanisms that facilitate the trafficking of extracellular RNA (exRNA) and cell surface glycoRNAs. This research explores the dynamic processes by which RNA molecules are transported across cellular barriers, emphasizing the role of glycoRNAs—RNAs modified with glycans—on cell surfaces. These glycoRNAs are implicated in cell communication and signaling, suggesting a sophisticated layer of regulatory control. The mechanisms of RNA trafficking involve various cellular machineries, including vesicular transport and membrane-bound receptors, which ensure the precise delivery and function of RNA molecules in extracellular environments. Understanding these processes provides insights into the physiological and pathological roles of exRNA and glycoRNAs, with potential implications for therapeutic strategies targeting RNA-based communication pathways. This review synthesizes current knowledge, highlighting the significance of RNA membrane crossing in cellular function and intercellular communication."}
