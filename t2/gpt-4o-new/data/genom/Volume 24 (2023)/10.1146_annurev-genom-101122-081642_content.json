{"Abstract": "The p-arms of human acrocentric chromosomes, which include chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22, are unique in their structure and function, primarily due to the presence of nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) that house ribosomal RNA genes. These regions are crucial for nucleolus formation and ribosome biogenesis. Unlike other chromosomal regions, the p-arms exhibit distinct patterns of heterochromatin organization and recombination. This study explores the molecular and genetic mechanisms that govern these differences, highlighting the role of NORs in chromosomal behavior and stability. The p-arms are also involved in Robertsonian translocations, a common chromosomal rearrangement that can lead to genetic disorders. Our findings suggest that the unique features of the p-arms are essential for maintaining genomic integrity and proper cellular function. Understanding these differences provides insights into chromosomal evolution and the etiology of chromosomal abnormalities, offering potential avenues for therapeutic intervention in related genetic conditions."}
