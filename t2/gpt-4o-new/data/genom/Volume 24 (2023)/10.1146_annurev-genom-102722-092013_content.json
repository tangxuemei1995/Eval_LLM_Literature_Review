{"Abstract": "Padlock probeâ€“based targeted in situ sequencing (ISS) is a powerful technique for spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT), enabling the precise localization of RNA molecules within tissue sections. This method employs padlock probes and rolling circle amplification (RCA) to achieve high sensitivity and specificity in detecting target transcripts. ISS facilitates the construction of spatial cell atlases and in situ cell typing, providing insights into cellular heterogeneity and tissue architecture. Recent advancements in ISS methodologies have expanded its applications in various biological and clinical research fields, offering a robust tool for understanding complex tissue environments and disease mechanisms at the molecular level."}
