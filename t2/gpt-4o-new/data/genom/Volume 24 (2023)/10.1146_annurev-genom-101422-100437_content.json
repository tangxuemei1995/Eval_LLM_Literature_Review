{"Abstract": "Single-cell expression quantitative trait loci (sc-eQTL) analysis has emerged as a powerful approach to unravel the complexities of gene regulation at the cellular level. By integrating single-cell sequencing technologies with eQTL mapping, researchers can now explore how genetic variants influence gene expression in specific cell types and states. This method provides unprecedented insights into the role of noncoding variants in modulating gene expression, which are often overlooked in bulk tissue analyses. The ability to dissect the heterogeneity of cell populations allows for a more precise understanding of the genetic architecture underlying complex traits and diseases. Recent advancements in computational tools and statistical models have further enhanced the resolution and accuracy of sc-eQTL studies, enabling the identification of cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms. This review highlights the methodological innovations in sc-eQTL mapping and discusses the implications of these findings for understanding gene regulation and the potential for personalized medicine applications."}
