{"Abstract": "The advent of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has significantly impacted data sharing practices within the scientific community, particularly in genomics research. This study examines the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) as a case study to explore the challenges and opportunities presented by GDPR in the context of open science. The HCA, a global initiative to map all human cells, relies heavily on the sharing of vast amounts of genomic data. Our analysis highlights how GDPR compliance necessitates robust data protection measures, influencing data accessibility and collaboration. We discuss the ethical considerations and technical strategies employed by the HCA to balance data protection with the imperative of open data sharing. Lessons from the HCA underscore the importance of developing standardized protocols and fostering international cooperation to navigate the complexities of GDPR. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on harmonizing data protection with the ethos of open science in genomics and beyond."}
