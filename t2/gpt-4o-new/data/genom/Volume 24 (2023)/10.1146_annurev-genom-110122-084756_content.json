{"Abstract": "Federated analysis has emerged as a pivotal approach for privacy-preserving data sharing, particularly in sensitive fields like genomics. This paper provides a comprehensive primer on the technical and legal frameworks underpinning federated analysis, emphasizing its role in safeguarding privacy while enabling collaborative research. By decentralizing data processing and analysis, federated systems mitigate privacy risks associated with centralized data storage, aligning with stringent regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The paper explores the technical architecture of federated systems, including data partitioning, model aggregation, and secure multi-party computation, alongside legal considerations that ensure compliance with privacy laws. Through case studies in genomics, the paper illustrates the practical applications and benefits of federated analysis, highlighting its potential to revolutionize data sharing practices by balancing the need for data utility with robust privacy protection."}
