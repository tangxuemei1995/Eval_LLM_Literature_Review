{"Abstract": "The axial length of the eye is a critical determinant of refractive errors, with deviations leading to conditions such as microphthalmia and high myopia. This study explores the genetic underpinnings that influence axial length variations from microphthalmia to high myopia in childhood. Utilizing a comprehensive genomic approach, we analyzed data from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole-exome sequencing to identify genetic variants associated with these conditions. Our findings reveal several novel loci and confirm previously reported genes implicated in ocular development and growth. Notably, we identified significant associations with genes involved in the regulation of eye size and shape, such as PAX6, which is crucial for eye morphogenesis, and MYOC, associated with ocular pressure regulation. Furthermore, we observed that certain genetic variants exhibit pleiotropic effects, influencing both microphthalmia and high myopia, suggesting a shared genetic architecture. These insights enhance our understanding of the genetic landscape governing axial length and provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Our study underscores the importance of early genetic screening in children at risk of developing severe refractive errors, paving the way for personalized medicine approaches in ophthalmology. Future research should focus on functional studies to elucidate the biological mechanisms by which these genetic determinants influence eye growth."}
