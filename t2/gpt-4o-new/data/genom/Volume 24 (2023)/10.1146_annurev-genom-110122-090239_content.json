{"Abstract": "The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a critical proteinaceous structure that facilitates homologous chromosome pairing and recombination during meiosis, a process essential for gametogenesis. Disruptions in the formation or function of the SC can lead to meiotic errors, resulting in infertility-related conditions such as azoospermia, primary ovarian failure, and recurrent pregnancy loss. This review synthesizes current research on the molecular architecture of the SC and its role in ensuring accurate chromosomal segregation. We explore genetic mutations and environmental factors that compromise SC integrity, leading to meiotic arrest or aneuploidy. Furthermore, we discuss recent advances in diagnostic techniques and potential therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring fertility in affected individuals. Understanding the intricate dynamics of the SC not only provides insights into the etiology of infertility but also opens avenues for novel fertility treatments. This research underscores the importance of the SC in reproductive health and its implications for clinical practice."}
