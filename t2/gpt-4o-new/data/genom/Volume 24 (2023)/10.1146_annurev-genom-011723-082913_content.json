{"Abstract": "The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression during neural crest cell development, with significant implications for both normal physiology and disease states. This study explores the involvement of key components of the SWI/SNF complex, including NF2 and Smarcb1, in the differentiation and function of Schwann cell precursors. Disruptions in these components are linked to the pathogenesis of rhabdoid tumors and schwannomas, highlighting their critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Our findings suggest that mutations or dysregulation of SWI/SNF complex members can lead to aberrant neural crest cell development, contributing to tumorigenesis. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes, this research provides insights into potential therapeutic targets for treating related diseases. The study underscores the importance of the SWI/SNF complex in neural crest biology and its potential as a focal point for understanding and intervening in neural crest-derived pathologies."}
