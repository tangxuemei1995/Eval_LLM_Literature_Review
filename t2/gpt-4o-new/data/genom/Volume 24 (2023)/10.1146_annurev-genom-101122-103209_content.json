{"Abstract": "The advent of large-scale and whole genome sequencing (WGS) has revolutionized genomic research, offering unprecedented insights into human health and disease. However, the return of results (RoR) from such studies, particularly secondary and incidental findings, presents complex ethical, legal, and practical challenges. This paper explores the evolving landscape of RoR in genomic research, emphasizing the need for a new normal that balances scientific advancement with participant rights and expectations. We examine current practices and policies, highlighting the variability in RoR approaches across different research contexts. The discussion includes the ethical implications of disclosing or withholding findings, the role of informed consent, and the impact of technological advancements on RoR processes. We propose a framework for RoR that incorporates stakeholder engagement, transparency, and adaptability to emerging genomic technologies. By addressing these challenges, the research community can enhance the ethical conduct of genomic studies and ensure that participants benefit from the knowledge generated by WGS."}
