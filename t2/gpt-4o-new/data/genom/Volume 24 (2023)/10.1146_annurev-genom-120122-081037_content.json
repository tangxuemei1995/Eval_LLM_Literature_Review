{"Abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hereditary hemoglobinopathy characterized by the presence of sickle-shaped red blood cells, leading to severe clinical complications. Recent advances in understanding the genetic modifiers of SCD have paved the way for innovative therapeutic strategies. This review explores the role of genetic modifiers in disease severity and the promising curative approaches, including gene therapy and gene editing. Gene therapy trials utilizing viral vectors have shown potential in correcting the defective hemoglobin gene, although concerns about genotoxicity remain. Gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR/Cas9, offer precise genome modifications, presenting a potential cure for SCD. However, challenges such as off-target effects and delivery mechanisms need to be addressed. This paper highlights the progress in genetic research and therapeutic interventions, emphasizing the need for continued exploration to achieve safe and effective cures for SCD."}
