{"Abstract": "The advent of genomic data has revolutionized the study of population relationships and history, providing unprecedented insights into demographic inference, admixture, and ancestry. This paper reviews contemporary methods for analyzing genomic data to assess population dynamics, focusing on the estimation of effective population size and the detection of historical admixture events. We explore the application of molecular clocks in dating population divergences and migrations, highlighting the integration of genomic data with computational models to reconstruct complex demographic histories. Key methodologies include coalescent theory, principal component analysis, and admixture mapping, each offering unique advantages in resolving population structure and historical relationships. The paper also discusses challenges such as the impact of selection, gene flow, and recombination on demographic inference. By synthesizing recent advancements, this review aims to provide a comprehensive framework for researchers to effectively utilize genomic data in understanding the intricate tapestry of human and non-human population histories."}
