{"Abstract": "Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), derived from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, represent a novel class of bioactive lipids with potential therapeutic applications in pain and itch management. This study explores the role of SPMs, including resolvins and neuroprotectins, in modulating neuroimmune interactions and their impact on nociceptive sensory neurons. By targeting transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, SPMs offer a unique mechanism for attenuating pain and itch, distinct from traditional anti-inflammatory drugs. The research highlights the ability of SPMs to promote resolution pharmacology, facilitating the return to homeostasis without immunosuppression. Through neuroimmune modulation, SPMs can effectively reduce the activation and sensitization of nociceptive pathways, offering a promising strategy for chronic pain and itch conditions. This review underscores the therapeutic potential of SPMs in clinical settings, advocating for further investigation into their mechanisms and applications in neuroimmune-related disorders."}
