{"Abstract": "Air pollution, particularly ultrafine particles and PM2.5, poses significant risks to neurological health across the life span. This review examines the impact of air pollution on neurodevelopmental disorders in children and neurodegenerative diseases in adults. Emerging evidence suggests that exposure to these pollutants can lead to brain metal dyshomeostasis, contributing to neurotoxicity. The mechanisms involve oxidative stress, inflammation, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier, which may exacerbate or initiate neurological conditions. Understanding these pathways is crucial for developing preventive strategies and public health policies to mitigate the adverse effects of air pollution on brain health."}
