{"Abstract": "Leukotrienes, derived from arachidonic acid, play a pivotal role in inflammatory responses and are implicated in various endemic diseases. Understanding the structures of leukotriene biosynthetic enzymes is crucial for the development of targeted therapeutics. This study reviews the structural biology of key enzymes involved in leukotriene synthesis, including 5-lipoxygenase and leukotriene A4 hydrolase, highlighting their active sites and conformational dynamics. Advances in structure-based drug design have facilitated the identification of novel inhibitors that can modulate leukotriene pathways, offering potential therapeutic strategies for conditions such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and cardiovascular diseases. By integrating structural insights with medicinal chemistry, this research aims to accelerate the development of effective anti-inflammatory agents, addressing unmet medical needs in managing chronic inflammatory disorders."}
