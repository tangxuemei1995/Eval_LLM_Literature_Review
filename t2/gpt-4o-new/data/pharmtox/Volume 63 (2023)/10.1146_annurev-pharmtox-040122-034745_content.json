{"Abstract": "cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, primarily recognized for their role in treating erectile dysfunction, have emerged as promising therapeutic agents for a variety of other clinical disorders. This review explores the expanding applications of PDE5 inhibitors beyond their traditional use, focusing on their potential in addressing endothelial dysfunction, providing cardioprotection, and managing metabolic disorders. The mechanisms by which PDE5 inhibitors exert beneficial effects in these conditions are linked to their ability to enhance nitric oxide signaling, improve vascular function, and modulate inflammatory pathways. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests their role in mitigating age-related pathologies and offering therapeutic benefits in certain cancer types. By examining current research and clinical trials, this paper highlights the multifaceted potential of PDE5 inhibitors, advocating for further investigation into their broader clinical applications and the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways."}
