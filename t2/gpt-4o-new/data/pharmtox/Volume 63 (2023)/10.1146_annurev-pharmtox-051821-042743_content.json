{"Abstract": "Resolution pharmacology represents a paradigm shift in therapeutic strategies, emphasizing the active resolution of inflammation rather than merely suppressing it. This approach leverages specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) and proteins such as annexin A1 to restore tissue homeostasis. Annexin A1 and its peptides play a pivotal role in modulating inflammatory responses, promoting the clearance of inflammatory cells, and enhancing tissue repair. Concurrently, SPMs, including resolvins, protectins, and maresins, orchestrate the resolution phase of inflammation by dampening pro-inflammatory signals and facilitating the return to homeostasis. This review highlights recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of annexin A1 and SPMs, underscoring their potential as innovative therapeutic agents. By targeting the resolution pathways, these mediators offer promising avenues for treating chronic inflammatory diseases, where traditional anti-inflammatory drugs fall short. Future research should focus on optimizing delivery systems and elucidating the long-term effects of these pro-resolving agents in clinical settings."}
