{"Abstract": "Neuropathic pain, a chronic condition resulting from nerve damage, presents a significant global health challenge due to its complex mechanisms and limited treatment options. This review explores the underlying biological processes, emphasizing the roles of immune cells and neurons in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain. Recent studies highlight the importance of sex differences and similarities in pain perception and response, suggesting that hormonal and genetic factors may influence the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Understanding these sex-specific mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted therapies. Current research is focused on novel therapeutic strategies, including modulation of immune responses and neuronal signaling pathways, to alleviate pain and improve quality of life for affected individuals. By integrating insights from immunology and neurobiology, this review aims to advance the development of personalized medicine approaches, addressing the diverse needs of patients suffering from neuropathic pain across different demographics."}
