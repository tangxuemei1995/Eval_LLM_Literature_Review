{"Abstract": "The G proteinâ€“coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) has emerged as a pivotal player in the non-genomic signaling pathways of estrogen, influencing a wide array of physiological processes. This review delves into the molecular pharmacology of GPER, highlighting its role in modulating cellular responses across various systems. In cancer, GPER's involvement in tumor progression and metastasis presents novel therapeutic targets. Cardiovascular research underscores GPER's protective effects against atherosclerosis and hypertension, while in the endocrine system, it mediates metabolic homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, GPER's influence on immune responses suggests potential in treating inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The receptor's diverse roles in metabolism, immunity, and disease pathogenesis underscore its therapeutic potential. This comprehensive analysis of GPER's molecular mechanisms and pharmacological applications aims to inform future research and clinical strategies, advancing the development of GPER-targeted therapies for a range of conditions."}
