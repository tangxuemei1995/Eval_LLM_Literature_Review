{"Abstract": "The global fight against HIV/AIDS has made significant strides with the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART), yet achieving universal access remains a formidable challenge. This paper outlines a comprehensive roadmap to attain universal antiretroviral treatment, aligning with the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets: 90% of people living with HIV knowing their status, 90% of diagnosed individuals receiving sustained ART, and 90% of those on ART achieving viral suppression. Key strategies include enhancing diagnostic capabilities, optimizing ART regimens for efficacy and tolerability, and addressing socio-economic barriers to access. The roadmap emphasizes the importance of health system strengthening, community engagement, and innovative financing mechanisms. Additionally, it highlights the role of reconstitution of immune function as a critical outcome of effective ART. By integrating these approaches, the roadmap aims to not only curb the HIV epidemic but also improve the quality of life for millions affected by the disease globally."}
