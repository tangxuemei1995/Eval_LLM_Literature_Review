{"Abstract": "Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), primarily eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are widely recognized for their potential benefits in cardiovascular health. This review examines the dualistic nature of LC-PUFAs, highlighting both their advantages and limitations in heart disease management. Numerous studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acids can reduce triglyceride levels, lower blood pressure, and exert anti-inflammatory effects, thereby mitigating several risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease. However, recent meta-analyses and clinical trials present mixed results, questioning the extent of their efficacy in reducing major cardiovascular events. Potential drawbacks include the risk of bleeding, particularly in individuals on anticoagulant therapy, and the variability in response among different populations. This paper underscores the need for personalized approaches in omega-3 supplementation and calls for further research to delineate optimal dosages and formulations to maximize cardiovascular benefits while minimizing adverse effects."}
