{"Abstract": "The chemical exposome encompasses the totality of environmental chemical exposures that individuals encounter throughout their lifetime, with significant implications during fetal development and early childhood. This review synthesizes current research on the chemical exposome, focusing on prenatal exposure to xenobiotics and natural contaminants. Human biomonitoring studies reveal that the placenta, while a partial barrier, allows the transfer of various chemicals, potentially affecting fetal development. The review highlights the critical windows of susceptibility during gestation and early childhood, where exposure to environmental chemicals can lead to adverse health outcomes. It also discusses methodological advancements in biomonitoring and analytical techniques that enhance our understanding of the exposome. By integrating data from epidemiological studies and mechanistic research, this review underscores the need for comprehensive strategies to mitigate exposure risks and protect vulnerable populations. Future research directions include refining exposure assessment methods and elucidating the complex interactions between chemical exposures and biological systems."}
