{"Abstract": "Obesity and its associated metabolic complications, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, represent a significant global health challenge. Recent advances in understanding the role of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) in metabolic regulation have opened new avenues for therapeutic interventions. FGFs, particularly FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23, have shown promise in modulating glucose and lipid metabolism, offering potential benefits for obesity-related conditions. This review explores the development of FGF-based pharmacotherapies, including recombinant proteins and agonistic antibodies, which aim to harness the metabolic regulatory properties of FGFs. These protein therapeutics have demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models and early-phase clinical trials, showing improvements in insulin sensitivity, weight reduction, and lipid profiles. However, challenges remain in optimizing their pharmacokinetics and minimizing adverse effects. Continued research is essential to fully elucidate the mechanisms of FGFs and to develop safe, effective treatments for obesity and its metabolic complications. This paper highlights the potential of FGF-based therapies as a novel approach in obesity management."}
