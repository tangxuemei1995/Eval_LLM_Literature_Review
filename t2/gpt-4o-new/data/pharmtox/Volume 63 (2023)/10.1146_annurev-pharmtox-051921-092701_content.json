{"Abstract": "The field of pharmacogenetics has significantly advanced our understanding of individual variability in response to antiplatelet therapy, particularly in the context of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). This review focuses on the role of pharmacogenomics in guiding antiplatelet therapy, with an emphasis on the CYP2C19 gene, which is crucial for the metabolism of clopidogrel, a commonly used antiplatelet drug. Variants in CYP2C19 can lead to altered drug metabolism, impacting therapeutic efficacy and safety. Precision medicine approaches, incorporating genetic testing, have the potential to optimize antiplatelet therapy by tailoring treatment to the genetic profile of the patient, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing adverse events. This paper discusses the current state of pharmacogenetic testing in clinical practice, the challenges in its implementation, and future directions for research. The integration of pharmacogenomics into clinical decision-making represents a promising step towards more personalized and effective antiplatelet therapy."}
