{"Abstract": "Synthetic cannabinoids, often marketed as 'Spice' or 'K2', represent a significant category of new psychoactive substances (NPS) that mimic the effects of Î”9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. These designer drugs are engineered to interact with the endocannabinoid system, often exhibiting higher potency and efficacy than natural cannabinoids. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the pharmacological and toxicological profiles of synthetic cannabinoids, highlighting their impact on public health. The rapid evolution of these compounds poses challenges for detection and regulation, contributing to their widespread abuse and association with severe adverse effects, including acute intoxication, psychosis, and substance use disorders. Understanding the mechanisms of action and the potential risks associated with synthetic cannabinoids is crucial for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies. This paper underscores the need for continued research and policy development to address the growing concerns surrounding these potent and unpredictable substances."}
