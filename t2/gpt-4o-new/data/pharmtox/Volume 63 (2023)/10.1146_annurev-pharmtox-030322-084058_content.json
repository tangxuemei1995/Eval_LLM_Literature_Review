{"Abstract": "The remote sensing and signaling theory posits that drug transporters play a crucial role in inter-organ communication, influencing pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. This study explores the involvement of organic anion transporters (OAT1, OAT3), organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP1B1, OATP1B3), and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRP2, MRP4) in this theory. These transporters, encoded by genes such as SLC22A6, SLC22A8, SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, ABCC2, and ABCC4, are integral to the movement of endogenous and exogenous compounds across cellular membranes. Additionally, the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2) is examined for its role in drug disposition and resistance. By analyzing the expression and function of these transporters, we aim to elucidate their contribution to the remote sensing and signaling network, which may impact drug efficacy and toxicity. This research underscores the importance of understanding transporter-mediated processes in drug development and personalized medicine, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for optimizing drug delivery and minimizing adverse effects."}
