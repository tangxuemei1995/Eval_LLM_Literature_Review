{"Abstract": "The integration of electronic health records (EHRs) with genomic data presents a transformative opportunity for drug discovery. This study explores the synergistic potential of EHRs and genomics, focusing on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) to identify novel drug targets. By leveraging Mendelian randomization, we aim to establish causal relationships between genetic variants and disease phenotypes, enhancing the precision of target validation. The vast phenotypic data available in EHRs, combined with genomic insights, allows for a comprehensive analysis of genetic predispositions and their clinical manifestations. This approach not only accelerates the identification of potential therapeutic targets but also facilitates the repurposing of existing drugs. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating multi-dimensional data sources to advance personalized medicine and improve drug efficacy and safety. This research highlights the critical role of interdisciplinary collaboration in harnessing the full potential of EHRs and genomics for innovative drug discovery."}
