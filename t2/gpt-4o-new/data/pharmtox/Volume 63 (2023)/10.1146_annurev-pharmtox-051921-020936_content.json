{"Abstract": "Arsenic, a ubiquitous environmental contaminant, presents a dualistic nature in its metabolism, significantly impacting human health. This study explores the intricate processes of arsenic speciation, focusing on its methylation and detoxification pathways. Arsenic metabolism involves the conversion of inorganic arsenic into various organic forms, with methylation playing a crucial role in modulating its toxicity. While methylation is traditionally viewed as a detoxification process, recent findings suggest that certain methylated arsenic species may exhibit heightened toxicity. This duality underscores the complexity of arsenic's impact on human health, necessitating a nuanced understanding of its metabolic pathways. By elucidating the mechanisms of arsenic metabolism, this research aims to inform risk assessment and therapeutic strategies, ultimately contributing to improved public health outcomes in arsenic-exposed populations."}
