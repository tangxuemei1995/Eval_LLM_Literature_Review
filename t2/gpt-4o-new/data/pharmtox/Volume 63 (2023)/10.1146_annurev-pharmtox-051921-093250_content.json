{"Abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia, significantly impacting functional outcomes and quality of life. This review explores the pathophysiological underpinnings of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, focusing on the roles of glutamate and dopamine neurotransmitter systems. Dysregulation of the NMDA receptor, a subtype of glutamate receptor, is implicated in the cognitive dysfunction observed in schizophrenia, with evidence suggesting that NMDA receptor hypofunction contributes to impaired synaptic plasticity and neurocognitive deficits. Mismatch negativity, an event-related potential reflecting automatic auditory processing, serves as a biomarker for NMDA receptor function and cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. Additionally, dopamine dysregulation, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, exacerbates cognitive deficits by disrupting executive function and working memory. Current treatment strategies targeting these pathways, including pharmacological agents modulating NMDA receptor activity and dopamine transmission, are discussed. Future research directions aim to develop more effective interventions to ameliorate cognitive deficits and improve patient outcomes."}
