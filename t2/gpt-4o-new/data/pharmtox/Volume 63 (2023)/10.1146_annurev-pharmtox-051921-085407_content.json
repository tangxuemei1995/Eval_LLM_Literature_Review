{"Abstract": "Lipoxins are endogenous lipid mediators that play a crucial role in the resolution phase of inflammation, promoting the return to tissue homeostasis and preventing chronic inflammatory diseases. This study explores the therapeutic potential of lipoxin mimetics, specifically AT-01-KG and AT-02-CT, in modulating inflammatory responses and reducing fibrosis. Through in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrate that these mimetics effectively enhance the resolution of inflammation by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production and promoting macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. Additionally, AT-01-KG and AT-02-CT were shown to attenuate fibrotic processes, suggesting their potential in treating fibrotic diseases. Our findings highlight the promise of lipoxin mimetics as novel therapeutic agents in managing chronic inflammation and fibrosis, offering a new avenue for the development of anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic therapies."}
