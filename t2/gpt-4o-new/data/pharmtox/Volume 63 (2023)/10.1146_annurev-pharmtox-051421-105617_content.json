{"Abstract": "Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have emerged as a prominent model organism in the fields of systems pharmacology and toxicology due to their scalability and relevance to human biology. This review highlights the advantages of zebrafish as an alternative in vivo model, emphasizing their genetic tractability, rapid development, and transparent embryos, which facilitate real-time observation of physiological processes. Zebrafish models offer a cost-effective and high-throughput platform for drug screening and toxicological assessments, bridging the gap between in vitro studies and mammalian models. Their genetic and physiological similarities to humans enable the study of complex biological pathways and disease mechanisms. Recent advancements in zebrafish research, including CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and high-resolution imaging techniques, have further solidified their role in mainstream pharmacological and toxicological research. This paper underscores the potential of zebrafish to revolutionize drug discovery and safety evaluation, promoting more ethical and efficient research methodologies."}
