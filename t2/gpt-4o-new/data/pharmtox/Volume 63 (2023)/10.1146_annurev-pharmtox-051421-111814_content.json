{"Abstract": "Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cardiac function and is implicated in the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure and arrhythmias. This review explores the potential of CaMKII as a therapeutic target, highlighting its involvement in calcium handling and signaling pathways that contribute to cardiac dysfunction. Dysregulation of CaMKII activity is associated with adverse cardiac remodeling and electrical instability, making it a promising candidate for therapeutic intervention. Recent advances in the development of selective CaMKII inhibitors offer new avenues for treatment, aiming to mitigate the progression of cardiovascular diseases by restoring normal calcium homeostasis and improving cardiac performance. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the therapeutic potential and safety of targeting CaMKII in clinical settings."}
