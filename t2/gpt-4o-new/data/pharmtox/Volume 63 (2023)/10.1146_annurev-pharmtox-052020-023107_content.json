{"Abstract": "Aspirin, a widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), has garnered significant attention for its potential role in cancer chemoprevention. This review explores recent pharmacological developments that elucidate aspirin's mechanisms in reducing cancer risk, focusing on its impact on cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes and the balance between thromboxane and prostacyclin. Aspirin's inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes leads to decreased production of prostaglandins, which are implicated in inflammation and tumorigenesis. The modulation of thromboxane and prostacyclin pathways further contributes to its antineoplastic effects, potentially reducing angiogenesis and metastasis. Emerging studies highlight aspirin's ability to influence molecular pathways beyond COX inhibition, including the modulation of immune responses and epigenetic alterations. These findings suggest a multifaceted role for aspirin in cancer prevention, with implications for personalized medicine approaches. However, the optimal dosage and duration for effective chemoprevention remain under investigation, necessitating further clinical trials. This review underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of aspirin's pharmacodynamics to maximize its therapeutic potential in oncology."}
