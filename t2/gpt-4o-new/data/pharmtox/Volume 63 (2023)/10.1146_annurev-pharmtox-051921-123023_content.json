{"Abstract": "Personalized therapeutics targeting KATP-dependent pathologies hold promise for conditions such as congenital hyperinsulinism, neonatal diabetes, and Cant√∫ syndrome. These disorders are linked to mutations in the KATP channel subunits, including Kir6.2, Kir6.1, SUR1, and SUR2, which regulate insulin secretion and vascular tone. Advances in genetic profiling and molecular biology have enabled the development of targeted therapies that address the specific mutations in these subunits. This review explores the current landscape of personalized medicine approaches, highlighting the potential of pharmacological agents and gene therapies tailored to individual genetic profiles. By focusing on the underlying molecular mechanisms, these strategies aim to improve clinical outcomes and reduce adverse effects, paving the way for more effective management of KATP-related diseases."}
