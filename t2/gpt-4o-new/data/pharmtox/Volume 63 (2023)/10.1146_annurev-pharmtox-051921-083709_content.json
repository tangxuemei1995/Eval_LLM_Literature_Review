{"Abstract": "This autobiographical exploration delves into the intricate chemistry and pharmacology of cannabinoids and endocannabinoids, focusing on key compounds such as anandamide, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and cannabidiol (CBD). The narrative traces the historical and scientific journey of these molecules, highlighting their discovery, structural elucidation, and the subsequent understanding of their roles within the endocannabinoid system. Emphasis is placed on the biochemical pathways and receptor interactions that underpin their physiological and therapeutic effects. Additionally, the study examines endocannabinoid-like compounds, expanding the scope of cannabinoid research and its implications for drug development. Through a personal lens, the author reflects on the challenges and breakthroughs encountered in this dynamic field, offering insights into the evolving landscape of cannabinoid science and its potential to revolutionize medical treatments. This work serves as both a scientific account and a personal testament to the transformative power of cannabinoid research."}
