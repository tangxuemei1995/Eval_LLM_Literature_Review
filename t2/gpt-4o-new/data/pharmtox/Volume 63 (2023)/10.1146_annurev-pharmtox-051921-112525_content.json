{"Abstract": "Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNDs), including postoperative delirium, are prevalent in the aging population, posing significant challenges to perioperative brain health. This review synthesizes current experimental models and identifies potential druggable targets to mitigate PNDs. Neuroinflammation emerges as a critical factor in the pathophysiology of these disorders, with animal models elucidating the underlying mechanisms. Cognitive assessment tools are essential for early detection and management, guiding the development of tailored care pathways. Recent advances in pharmacological interventions targeting neuroinflammatory pathways offer promising avenues for therapeutic strategies. This study underscores the importance of integrating experimental findings into clinical practice to enhance perioperative care and improve cognitive outcomes in elderly patients. Future research should focus on refining these models and exploring novel targets to optimize perioperative brain health."}
