{"Abstract": "Biased agonism at opioid receptors represents a promising avenue for developing analgesics with reduced side effects. This concept involves the preferential activation of specific signaling pathways by different ligands binding to the same receptor. In the context of opioid receptors, ligand bias typically refers to the differential activation of G protein versus β-arrestin pathways. Studies have shown that G protein-biased agonists can provide effective pain relief while minimizing adverse effects such as respiratory depression and constipation, which are often associated with β-arrestin pathway activation. Recent advances in structural biology and pharmacology have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying ligand bias, offering insights into receptor conformational changes and signaling dynamics. This review synthesizes current findings on opioid receptor biased agonism, highlighting the therapeutic potential and challenges in designing selective ligands that exploit this phenomenon for improved clinical outcomes."}
