{"Abstract": "Mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases (MKPs), a subset of dual specificity protein phosphatases, play a crucial role in the regulation of cell signaling pathways by deactivating mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Historically considered 'undruggable' due to their highly conserved active sites and the challenge of achieving specificity, recent advances have shifted this paradigm. This review explores the emerging strategies targeting MKPs, focusing on the identification of allosteric sites that offer new avenues for the development of selective small molecule inhibitors. These inhibitors have the potential to modulate MKP activity with high specificity, thereby influencing MAPK-driven cellular processes implicated in various diseases, including cancer and inflammatory disorders. The discovery of these allosteric sites, coupled with advances in computational modeling and high-throughput screening, has revitalized interest in MKPs as viable therapeutic targets. This progress underscores the potential of MKP inhibitors to become a new class of drugs, offering promising therapeutic benefits in disease modulation."}
