{"Abstract": "Lysosomal ion channels, including two-pore channels (TPCs), transient receptor potential mucolipin channels (TRPMLs), and TMEM175, play crucial roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating ion fluxes within lysosomes. These channels are integral to lysosomal functions such as autophagy, endocytosis, and lysosomal exocytosis, which are vital for cellular waste management and nutrient recycling. Dysregulation of lysosomal ion channels has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets. Recent advances in structural biology and pharmacology have provided insights into the mechanisms of these channels, paving the way for the development of small-molecule modulators. This review explores the physiological roles of lysosomal ion channels, their involvement in neurodegenerative pathologies, and evaluates their druggability. By understanding the molecular underpinnings of these channels, novel therapeutic strategies can be devised to modulate their activity, offering promising avenues for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders."}
