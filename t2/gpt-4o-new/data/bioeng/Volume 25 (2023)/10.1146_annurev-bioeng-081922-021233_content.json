{"Abstract": "Epitranscriptional regulation, a burgeoning field within molecular biology, explores the dynamic modifications of RNA molecules and their implications for gene expression. This review delves into the intersection of epitranscriptomics and cardiovascular bioengineering, highlighting the potential for novel therapeutic strategies. The epitranscriptome encompasses a variety of chemical modifications, such as methylation and acetylation, which can influence RNA stability, localization, and translation. In the context of cardiovascular health, these modifications play crucial roles in the regulation of genes involved in heart development, function, and disease. By integrating insights from RNA biology with engineering principles, researchers aim to develop innovative approaches to modulate gene expression in cardiovascular tissues. This synthesis of disciplines promises to advance our understanding of cardiovascular pathophysiology and foster the development of targeted interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes in cardiovascular diseases."}
