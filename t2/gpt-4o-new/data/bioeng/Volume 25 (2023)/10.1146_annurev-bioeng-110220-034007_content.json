{"Abstract": "The study of lipids at the single-cell level is crucial for understanding cellular heterogeneity and lipid-related diseases. This review explores advanced analytical techniques employed in single-cell biochemical assays of lipids, focusing on mass spectrometry, Raman imaging, capillary electrophoresis, and thin layer chromatography. Mass spectrometry offers high sensitivity and specificity, enabling detailed lipid profiling. Raman imaging provides non-destructive, label-free analysis, allowing for spatial distribution mapping of lipids within cells. Capillary electrophoresis, with its high-resolution separation capabilities, is effective for analyzing complex lipid mixtures in single cells. Thin layer chromatography, although less sensitive, remains a valuable tool for preliminary lipid separation and identification. The integration of these techniques enhances the understanding of lipidomics at the single-cell level, offering insights into cellular metabolism and disease mechanisms. Future advancements in these methodologies promise to further unravel the complexities of lipid function and regulation in individual cells."}
