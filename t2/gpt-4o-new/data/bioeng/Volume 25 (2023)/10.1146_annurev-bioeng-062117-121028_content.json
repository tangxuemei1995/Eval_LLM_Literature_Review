{"Abstract": "Dehydration is a critical health concern that can lead to severe complications if not promptly detected and managed. Traditional methods of assessing hydration status are often invasive, time-consuming, and not suitable for continuous monitoring. Recent advancements in wearable technology and noninvasive sensors offer promising alternatives for real-time hydration monitoring. This review examines the current state of noninvasive devices designed to detect dehydration, focusing on their technological capabilities, accuracy, and practicality in various settings. We explore the integration of biosensors, optical techniques, and machine learning algorithms in wearable devices that aim to provide continuous and reliable hydration status feedback. Despite significant progress, challenges remain in achieving widespread clinical adoption, including device calibration, user compliance, and data interpretation. Future research should address these limitations to enhance the efficacy and accessibility of noninvasive hydration monitoring solutions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and preventive healthcare strategies."}
