{"Abstract": "This study explores the role of neural plasticity in sensorimotor brainâ€“machine interfaces (BMIs), focusing on how sensory and motor learning processes adapt neural circuits. By examining the dynamic interactions between neural plasticity and BMI performance, we identify key mechanisms that facilitate adaptation and learning in neural circuits. Our findings suggest that targeted modulation of plasticity can enhance BMI efficiency, offering insights into optimizing sensory and motor integration. This research advances our understanding of neural adaptation in BMIs, with implications for developing more effective neuroprosthetic devices and rehabilitation strategies for individuals with motor impairments."}
