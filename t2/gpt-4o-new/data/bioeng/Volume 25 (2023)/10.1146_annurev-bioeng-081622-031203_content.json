{"Abstract": "Hemolysis, the rupture of red blood cells, releases hemoglobin, heme, and iron into the bloodstream, leading to oxidative stress and tissue damage. This study explores the engineering of novel therapeutics aimed at detoxifying these potentially harmful molecules. By enhancing the natural scavenging systems, such as haptoglobin and hemopexin, these therapeutics aim to mitigate the deleterious effects associated with free hemoglobin and heme. The research focuses on the biochemical interactions and the development of synthetic analogs or recombinant proteins that can efficiently bind and neutralize hemoglobin, heme, and iron. Preliminary results indicate promising efficacy in reducing oxidative stress markers and improving clinical outcomes in hemolytic conditions. This approach holds potential for advancing treatment strategies for diseases characterized by excessive hemolysis, offering a targeted method to alleviate associated complications."}
