{"Abstract": "The study explores the development of engineered compounds designed to modulate ice nucleation and recrystallization processes, crucial for applications in cryopreservation and climate science. By mimicking the properties of natural antifreeze (glyco)proteins, these compounds exhibit significant thermal hysteresis, effectively lowering the freezing point and inhibiting ice growth. The research highlights the synthesis and characterization of these compounds, demonstrating their ability to control ice crystal formation and growth. Experimental results indicate a promising potential for these engineered molecules to enhance the stability of frozen biological materials and improve the efficiency of de-icing technologies. This work paves the way for innovative solutions in managing ice-related challenges across various fields."}
