{"Abstract": "The integration of sex as a biological variable in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine is crucial for advancing precision medicine. This study explores the impact of sexual dimorphism on tissue models and stem cell behavior, highlighting the necessity of considering sex differences in research and clinical applications. By examining sex-specific characteristics, we aim to enhance the efficacy and safety of regenerative therapies. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating sex-based analyses to better understand cellular responses and tissue regeneration processes. This approach promises to refine therapeutic strategies, ensuring they are tailored to the unique biological needs of both sexes, ultimately improving patient outcomes in regenerative medicine."}
