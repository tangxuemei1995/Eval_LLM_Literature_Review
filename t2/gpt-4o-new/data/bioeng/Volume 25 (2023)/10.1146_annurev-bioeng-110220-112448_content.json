{"Abstract": "The integration of bioelectronic sensor nodes into the Internet of Bodies (IoB) represents a transformative advancement in healthcare and personal monitoring. These sensor nodes, leveraging the principles of the Internet of Things (IoT), are designed to continuously monitor physiological parameters, enabling real-time health analytics and personalized medicine. This paper explores the architecture of bioelectronic sensor nodes, focusing on their sensing capabilities, in-sensor analytics, and the computational frameworks that support data processing and communication. Key challenges such as secure data transmission, energy-efficient powering solutions, and the protection of sensitive health information are addressed. The study highlights recent innovations in low-power electronics and energy harvesting techniques that enhance the autonomy and longevity of these devices. Furthermore, the paper discusses the implications of integrating these nodes into broader IoB networks, emphasizing the need for robust security protocols to safeguard against potential cyber threats. By advancing the development of bioelectronic sensor nodes, this research contributes to the realization of a more interconnected and responsive healthcare ecosystem."}
