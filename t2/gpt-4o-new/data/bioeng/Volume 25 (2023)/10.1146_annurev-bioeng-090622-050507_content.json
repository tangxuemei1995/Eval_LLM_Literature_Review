{"Abstract": "The development of penetrating neural electrodes has significantly advanced the field of electrophysiology, enabling precise interfacing with neural tissue for both research and clinical applications. This paper reviews recent advancements in electrode technology aimed at achieving large-scale neural recordings and enhancing the longevity of implants. Innovations in materials science, such as the use of biocompatible and flexible substrates, have been pivotal in reducing tissue response and improving chronic stability. Additionally, the integration of microfabrication techniques has facilitated the production of high-density electrode arrays, allowing for comprehensive mapping of neural circuits. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in maintaining electrode functionality over extended periods due to biological and mechanical factors. This review highlights current strategies to address these issues, including surface modifications and novel electrode designs, and discusses future directions for the development of durable, large-scale neural interfaces that can withstand the demands of chronic implantation."}
