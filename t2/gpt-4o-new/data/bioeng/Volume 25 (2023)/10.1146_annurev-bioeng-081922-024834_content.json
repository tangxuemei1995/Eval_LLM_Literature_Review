{"Abstract": "This paper explores the integration of human- and equity-centered approaches in the design of health technologies, emphasizing the importance of contextual and community engagement. Traditional health technology design often overlooks the diverse needs and contexts of end-users, leading to inequitable access and outcomes. By incorporating human-centered design principles, developers can create more inclusive and effective solutions that address the specific needs of diverse populations. Equity-centered engineering further ensures that these technologies do not perpetuate existing disparities but instead promote fairness and accessibility. The paper highlights the role of contextual investigation and stakeholder engagement in understanding the unique challenges faced by different communities. Through case studies and theoretical analysis, the research underscores the necessity of involving a broad range of stakeholders, including marginalized groups, in the design process. This approach not only enhances the relevance and usability of health technologies but also fosters trust and collaboration between developers and communities."}
