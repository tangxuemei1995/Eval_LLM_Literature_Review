{"Abstract": "Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) has emerged as a promising modality for the non-invasive characterization of bone, offering high-resolution insights into bone structure and composition. This review provides an overview of the principles of PAI, highlighting its integration with quantitative ultrasound and spectral unmixing techniques to enhance bone imaging. Applications in medical diagnostics, particularly in assessing bone health and detecting pathologies such as osteoporosis, are discussed. The synergy between PAI and quantitative ultrasound allows for improved contrast and depth penetration, while spectral unmixing facilitates the differentiation of bone components. Current challenges, including the need for standardized protocols and advanced data processing algorithms, are addressed. The outlook for PAI in bone imaging is optimistic, with potential advancements in clinical applications and personalized medicine on the horizon."}
