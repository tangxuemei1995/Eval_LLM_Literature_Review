{"Abstract": "Neurotechnology has emerged as a promising frontier in the management of chronic pain, offering innovative solutions that target the nervous system directly. This review explores the efficacy and mechanisms of various neurotechnological interventions, including deep brain stimulation (DBS), spinal cord stimulation (SCS), and transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS). These modalities aim to modulate pain pathways by influencing neural activity at different levels of the nervous system. DBS targets central pain processing centers, while SCS and TENS focus on the spinal cord and peripheral nervous system, respectively. Recent advancements in these technologies have shown potential in reducing pain intensity and improving quality of life for patients with refractory chronic pain conditions. The integration of neurotechnology into pain management protocols represents a significant shift towards personalized medicine, emphasizing the need for further research to optimize treatment parameters and understand long-term outcomes. This paper highlights current challenges and future directions in the field."}
