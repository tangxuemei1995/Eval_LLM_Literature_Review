{"Abstract": "The pursuit of anti-aging strategies has gained significant momentum, driven by advances in understanding the biological mechanisms underlying aging and senescence. This review explores current trends in anti-aging research, focusing on the manipulation of biological clocks, cellular rejuvenation, and the treatment of age-related diseases. Recent studies have highlighted the role of genetic and epigenetic factors in regulating the aging process, offering potential targets for intervention. Innovative approaches, such as senolytics and telomere extension, aim to delay or reverse cellular senescence, thereby promoting longevity and healthspan. Additionally, insights from progeria, a model of accelerated aging, have provided valuable information on the molecular pathways involved in aging. The integration of these strategies holds promise for developing effective anti-aging therapies. However, challenges remain in translating these findings into clinical applications. This review underscores the importance of continued research to unravel the complexities of aging and develop comprehensive strategies for human rejuvenation."}
