{"Abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into healthcare has the potential to revolutionize personalized medicine by predicting health deterioration and understanding disease pathways. This study explores the development of predictive models that utilize time series data to analyze digital health pathways and disease trajectories. By leveraging large datasets, these models can identify patterns and early indicators of disease progression, enabling timely interventions tailored to individual patients. The research focuses on the application of advanced ML algorithms to enhance the accuracy and reliability of predictions, thereby improving patient outcomes. The findings suggest that AI-driven models can significantly contribute to the personalization of treatment plans, offering a more nuanced understanding of disease mechanisms. This approach not only facilitates early diagnosis but also supports the design of targeted therapies, ultimately advancing the field of digital health. The study underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in harnessing AI for transformative healthcare solutions."}
