{"Abstract": "Label-free optical metabolic imaging has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating cellular and tissue metabolism without the need for exogenous labels. This technique leverages the intrinsic autofluorescence properties of metabolic cofactors such as NADH and FAD, which are key indicators of cellular redox states and metabolic pathways like glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. By employing multiphoton microscopy and two-photon excited fluorescence, researchers can achieve high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging of live cells and tissues. Fluorescence lifetime imaging further enhances this approach by providing quantitative insights into the microenvironment and binding states of these cofactors. This method allows for real-time monitoring of metabolic changes, offering significant advantages in studying disease progression, drug response, and cellular heterogeneity. The non-invasive nature of label-free optical metabolic imaging makes it particularly suitable for longitudinal studies and clinical applications, paving the way for advancements in personalized medicine and therapeutic interventions. This review highlights recent developments and applications of this technology in biomedical research."}
