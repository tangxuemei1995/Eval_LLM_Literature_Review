{"Abstract": "This study investigates the determinants of social cognitive aging, focusing on the interplay between social resources, context, motivation, and cognitive effort. By examining these factors, we aim to predict resilience and risk in cognitive aging. Social resources, such as support networks and community engagement, are hypothesized to buffer against cognitive decline, while contextual factors, including socioeconomic status and cultural influences, may modulate cognitive trajectories. Motivation and cognitive effort are explored as intrinsic factors that drive engagement in cognitively demanding activities, potentially enhancing cognitive resilience. The study employs an ecologically valid approach, utilizing real-world settings and longitudinal data to capture the dynamic nature of cognitive aging. Findings are expected to elucidate the complex interactions between these determinants, offering insights into strategies for promoting cognitive health in aging populations. This research underscores the importance of a holistic perspective in understanding and supporting cognitive aging."}
