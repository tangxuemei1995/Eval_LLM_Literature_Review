{"Abstract": "This study explores the role of psychosocial and integrative oncology interventions across the cancer care continuum, focusing on their efficacy in managing anxiety, depression, and distress. It examines cognitive-behavioral and acceptance-based therapies, alongside mindfulness and mind-body approaches, as pivotal in enhancing patient well-being. The research highlights the emerging potential of psychedelic therapy in alleviating psychological distress in oncology settings. By integrating these diverse therapeutic modalities, the study underscores the importance of a holistic approach to cancer care, addressing both psychological and physiological needs. The findings suggest that tailored interventions can significantly improve quality of life for patients, advocating for their inclusion in standard oncology care practices to support patients throughout their disease trajectory."}
