{"Abstract": "The development of color perception and cognition is a complex process that begins in infancy and continues through childhood. This study explores the stages of color perception development, examining how infants initially perceive colors and how this ability evolves into more sophisticated cognitive processes. Utilizing a combination of longitudinal studies and cross-sectional analyses, the research highlights the role of both biological maturation and environmental influences in shaping color cognition. Key findings suggest that while infants can distinguish between basic colors, the ability to categorize and name colors develops later, influenced by language acquisition and cultural factors. The study also investigates the neural mechanisms underlying these processes, providing insights into how early visual experiences contribute to cognitive development. By understanding the trajectory of color perception and cognition, this research offers valuable implications for educational strategies and interventions aimed at enhancing cognitive development in early childhood."}
