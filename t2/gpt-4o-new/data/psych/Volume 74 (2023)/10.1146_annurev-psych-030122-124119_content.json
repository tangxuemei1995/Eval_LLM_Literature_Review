{"Abstract": "Cancer patients and survivors often face significant psychological and physiological stressors that can adversely affect their health outcomes. This study explores the efficacy of stress management interventions, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), in facilitating adaptation and improving health outcomes in this population. By examining a range of cancer-related stressors, the research highlights the mechanisms through which psychological and physiological adaptations occur. The findings suggest that targeted stress management interventions can significantly enhance coping strategies, reduce anxiety and depression, and improve overall quality of life. Furthermore, these interventions may contribute to better physiological outcomes, such as immune function and treatment adherence. The study underscores the importance of integrating stress management into cancer care to optimize health outcomes. Future research should focus on tailoring interventions to individual needs and exploring the long-term benefits of such programs in diverse cancer populations."}
