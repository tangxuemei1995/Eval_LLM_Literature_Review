{"Abstract": "Self-compassion, a construct rooted in Buddhist philosophy, has gained significant attention in psychological research for its potential to enhance well-being and resilience. This paper explores the theoretical underpinnings of self-compassion, distinguishing it from related constructs such as self-esteem and self-pity. Methodologically, the study reviews various measures of self-compassion, emphasizing the Self-Compassion Scale as a reliable tool for assessment. Empirical research highlights the role of self-compassion in promoting mental health, reducing anxiety and depression, and fostering adaptive coping strategies. The integration of mindfulness practices is discussed as a critical component in cultivating self-compassion, enhancing individuals' ability to respond to personal failures with kindness and understanding. Intervention studies demonstrate the efficacy of self-compassion training programs in diverse populations, suggesting practical applications for clinical and educational settings. This comprehensive review underscores the importance of self-compassion as a vital resource for psychological resilience and overall well-being."}
