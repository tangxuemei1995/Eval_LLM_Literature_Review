{"Abstract": "This study proposes a comprehensive socioecological-genetic framework to explore the intricate interplay between culture and personality. By integrating socioecological and genetic perspectives, the framework examines how cultural and personality traits are shaped by both environmental and genetic factors. It highlights the dynamic nature of cultural and personality changes, emphasizing the role of socioecological contexts and genetic predispositions. The research underscores the importance of genes × environment interactions in understanding the nature–nurture debate, offering insights into how cultural shifts influence personality development and vice versa. This framework provides a novel lens for examining the co-evolution of culture and personality, contributing to a deeper understanding of their roots, trends, and mutual influences in shaping human behavior."}
