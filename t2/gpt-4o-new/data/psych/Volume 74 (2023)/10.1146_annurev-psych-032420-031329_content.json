{"Abstract": "Conspiracy theories, often characterized by their speculative nature and resistance to falsification, have become a pervasive element in contemporary discourse. This study aims to provide a comprehensive definition of conspiracy theories, examining their psychological and sociocultural correlates, potential consequences, and modes of communication. By synthesizing existing literature, we identify key predictors of conspiracy beliefs, including cognitive biases, personality traits, and social influences. The consequences of these beliefs are explored, highlighting their impact on individual behavior, societal trust, and democratic processes. Furthermore, the study investigates the role of digital media in the dissemination and reinforcement of conspiracy theories, emphasizing the importance of understanding communication dynamics in the digital age. Through a definitional approach, this research seeks to clarify the complex nature of conspiracy theories, offering insights into their persistence and influence. The findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to mitigate the negative effects of conspiracy beliefs and promote critical thinking in public discourse."}
