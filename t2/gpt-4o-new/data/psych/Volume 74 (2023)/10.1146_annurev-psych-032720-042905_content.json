{"Abstract": "The psychology of climate change is a burgeoning field that explores the cognitive, emotional, and social dimensions influencing public perception and action regarding climate change. This study examines the interplay between individual values, climate change beliefs, and the acceptability of climate action, highlighting the psychological barriers and motivators for systemic change. By analyzing how values shape beliefs and attitudes towards climate change, the research identifies key psychological factors that either hinder or facilitate proactive climate behaviors. The findings suggest that aligning climate action with core personal and cultural values can enhance its acceptability and effectiveness. Furthermore, the study underscores the importance of addressing cognitive biases and emotional responses to foster a more informed and engaged public. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the psychological underpinnings of climate change perceptions and offers insights into designing interventions that promote sustainable behavior and support systemic change."}
