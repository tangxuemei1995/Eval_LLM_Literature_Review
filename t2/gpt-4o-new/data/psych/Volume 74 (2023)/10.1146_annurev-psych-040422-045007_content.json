{"Abstract": "Careless responding in survey data poses significant challenges to the validity and reliability of research findings. This paper explores strategies for preventing, identifying, and addressing insufficient effort responding (IER) in survey methodology. We review current literature on the prevalence and impact of invalid responding, including random and lazy respondent behaviors. Best practices for survey design are discussed, emphasizing the importance of clear instructions, attention checks, and response time analysis to mitigate careless responses. Additionally, we propose a framework for identifying IER through statistical techniques and data screening methods. By implementing these strategies, researchers can enhance data quality and ensure more accurate and meaningful results in survey-based studies."}
