{"Abstract": "This study explores psychological resilience through the lens of affect-regulation, proposing a comprehensive framework that integrates emotion regulation strategies as pivotal mechanisms in fostering resilience. Resilience, the capacity to adapt positively in the face of adversity, is increasingly recognized as a dynamic process influenced by individual differences in stress and coping mechanisms. By examining the interplay between emotion and affect regulation, this research highlights how adaptive regulation strategies can mitigate the impact of stressors, thereby enhancing psychological health. The framework posits that effective emotion regulation not only buffers against negative emotional responses but also promotes positive affective states, facilitating recovery and growth following adverse experiences. Empirical evidence is drawn from interdisciplinary studies, underscoring the importance of tailored interventions that enhance emotion regulation skills to bolster resilience. This approach offers valuable insights for developing therapeutic practices aimed at improving mental health outcomes in diverse populations."}
