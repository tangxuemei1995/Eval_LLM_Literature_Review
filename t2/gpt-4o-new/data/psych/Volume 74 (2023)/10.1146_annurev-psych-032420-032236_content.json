{"Abstract": "Self-continuity, the perception of a coherent and consistent identity over time, plays a crucial role in shaping attitudes, behaviors, and psychological health. This study explores the multifaceted nature of self-continuity, examining its influence across different cultural contexts and its interaction with the collective self. By integrating cross-cultural perspectives, the research highlights how cultural norms and values impact the development and maintenance of self-continuity. The findings suggest that a strong sense of self-continuity is associated with positive psychological outcomes, including enhanced well-being and resilience. Furthermore, the study investigates the mechanisms through which self-continuity influences behavior, revealing that individuals with a stable sense of identity are more likely to engage in behaviors consistent with their long-term goals and values. The research underscores the importance of fostering self-continuity in diverse cultural settings to promote psychological health and adaptive behavior, offering insights for interventions aimed at enhancing individual and collective well-being."}
