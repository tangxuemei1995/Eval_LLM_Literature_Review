{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between vision and action, emphasizing the roles of consciousness and attention in mediating this dynamic interplay. By re-evaluating traditional models, we propose a framework that integrates perceptual processes with motor responses, highlighting how attentional mechanisms modulate conscious awareness and influence decision-making. Through a synthesis of recent empirical findings and theoretical advancements, we argue that vision and action are not merely sequential processes but are deeply interconnected, with consciousness serving as a pivotal mediator. This rethinking challenges conventional paradigms and suggests new directions for research in cognitive neuroscience, with implications for understanding disorders of perception and action, and for developing interventions that enhance cognitive and motor functions."}
