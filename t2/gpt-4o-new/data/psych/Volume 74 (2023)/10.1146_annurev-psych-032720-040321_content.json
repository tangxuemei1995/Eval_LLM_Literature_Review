{"Abstract": "Pride, a complex self-conscious emotion, plays a pivotal role in the attainment and maintenance of social rank. This study explores the dual pathways through which pride influences social hierarchy: prestige and dominance. Prestige, associated with admiration and respect, is linked to authentic pride, characterized by confidence and accomplishment. In contrast, dominance, often related to fear and control, is connected to hubristic pride, marked by arrogance and egotism. By examining the psychological and social mechanisms underlying these pathways, the research highlights how pride can both positively and negatively impact social status. The findings suggest that while authentic pride fosters cooperative and prosocial behaviors conducive to prestige, hubristic pride may lead to aggressive and manipulative tactics for dominance. Understanding these dynamics offers insights into the emotional foundations of social rank and the complex interplay between individual emotions and social structures."}
