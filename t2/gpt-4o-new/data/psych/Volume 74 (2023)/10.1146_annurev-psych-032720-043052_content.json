{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of gender inclusion and person-environment fit within the STEM fields, focusing on how stereotypes and cultural norms impact diversity and inclusion efforts. Despite increased awareness and initiatives aimed at promoting gender diversity, women remain underrepresented in science and technology sectors. This research examines the role of gender stereotypes in shaping perceptions of fit and belonging, which are critical for career satisfaction and retention. By analyzing qualitative and quantitative data from various STEM environments, the study identifies key barriers to gender inclusion and proposes strategies to enhance person-environment fit for women. The findings suggest that addressing implicit biases and fostering inclusive cultures can significantly improve gender diversity in STEM. This research contributes to the broader discourse on diversity and inclusion by highlighting the importance of aligning organizational practices with the diverse needs of individuals, ultimately promoting a more equitable and innovative STEM workforce."}
