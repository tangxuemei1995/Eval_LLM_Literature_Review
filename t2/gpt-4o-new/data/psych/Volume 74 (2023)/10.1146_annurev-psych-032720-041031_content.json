{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate mechanisms underlying human object vision, emphasizing the role of the visual cortex in object recognition. By examining the parallels between human visual processing and deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), we aim to elucidate how object representations are formed and utilized in both biological and artificial systems. Our research integrates behavioral experiments with computational modeling to assess the fidelity of DCNNs in mimicking human object recognition capabilities. Findings suggest that while DCNNs capture certain aspects of human visual processing, discrepancies remain in the complexity and flexibility of object representations. This work advances our understanding of visual cognition and informs the development of more sophisticated artificial vision systems, bridging the gap between human and machine perception."}
