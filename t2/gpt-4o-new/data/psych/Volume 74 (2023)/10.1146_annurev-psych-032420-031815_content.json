{"Abstract": "Evaluative conditioning (EC) is a psychological phenomenon where the valence of a stimulus is altered through its association with another stimulus. This process plays a crucial role in attitude formation, influencing preferences and aversions. Historically, EC has been understood through associative learning theories, which emphasize the automatic formation of links between stimuli. However, recent research suggests that propositional processes, involving conscious and deliberate reasoning, also contribute to EC. This dual-process perspective has broadened the understanding of how attitudes are formed and changed. Despite significant advancements, challenges remain in establishing the external validity of EC findings, particularly in real-world settings. Future research should focus on integrating associative and propositional models to better predict EC outcomes and explore the boundary conditions under which EC operates. Additionally, enhancing methodological approaches to improve the ecological validity of EC studies will be essential for translating laboratory findings into practical applications in fields such as marketing and public health."}
