{"Abstract": "The discovery of interstellar interlopers, such as 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, has opened new avenues for understanding the dynamics and composition of objects originating outside our solar system. This study explores the characteristics of these interstellar comets, focusing on their trajectories, physical properties, and potential origins within protoplanetary disks. By analyzing observational data and employing advanced modeling techniques, we aim to elucidate the processes that eject these bodies from their parent systems and their subsequent journey through interstellar space. Our findings suggest that interstellar interlopers provide unique insights into the diversity of planetary formation environments and the chemical makeup of distant protoplanetary disks. This research underscores the importance of continued observation and study of these rare visitors to enhance our understanding of the broader galactic context of planetary system formation."}
