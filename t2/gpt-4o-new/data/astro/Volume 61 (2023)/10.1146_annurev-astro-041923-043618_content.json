{"Abstract": "Hydrodynamical simulations have become a cornerstone in understanding galaxy formation and evolution, offering insights into the complex interplay between gas dynamics, star formation, and feedback processes. These simulations have successfully reproduced key properties of galaxy populations, such as the stellar mass function and the distribution of galaxy halos. However, significant challenges remain, particularly in accurately modeling the baryonic processes that govern gas accretion and star formation within galaxies. Discrepancies between simulated and observed galaxy morphologies and the role of feedback mechanisms in regulating galaxy growth highlight areas for further refinement. This review synthesizes the enduring successes of current hydrodynamical models while identifying outstanding challenges that must be addressed to enhance the predictive power of simulations in the context of galaxy formation theories."}
