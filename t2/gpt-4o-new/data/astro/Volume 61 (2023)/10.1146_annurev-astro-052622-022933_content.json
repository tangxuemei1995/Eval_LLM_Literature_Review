{"Abstract": "Circumbinary accretion, a process where material from a surrounding disk is accreted onto a binary system, plays a pivotal role in the evolution of both stellar and black hole binaries. This study explores the dynamics of circumbinary accretion across a range of astrophysical contexts, from binary stars to massive binary black holes. Utilizing advanced hydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the influence of binary mass ratios, orbital eccentricities, and disk properties on accretion rates and disk morphology. Our findings reveal that circumbinary disks exhibit complex structures, including spiral arms and gaps, which significantly affect the accretion flow onto the binary components. In the context of star formation, these processes are crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of binary star systems and their associated protoplanetary disks, which may host exoplanets. For massive binary black holes, circumbinary accretion is a key mechanism influencing their coalescence and the emission of gravitational waves, with implications for the detection of such events by observatories like LIGO and Virgo. Additionally, the study highlights the potential for circumbinary accretion to drive the growth of supermassive black holes in galactic centers. By bridging the gap between stellar and black hole binaries, this research provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the universal principles governing circumbinary accretion, offering insights into the complex interplay between binary dynamics and accretion processes across different astrophysical environments."}
