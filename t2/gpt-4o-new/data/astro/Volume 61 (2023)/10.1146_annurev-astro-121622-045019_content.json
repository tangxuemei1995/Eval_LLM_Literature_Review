{"Abstract": "Optical/infrared interferometry has emerged as a transformative technique in astronomical observations, offering unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. Recent advancements in instrumentation have significantly enhanced the capabilities of interferometric arrays, enabling detailed studies of a wide range of astrophysical phenomena. This paper reviews the latest developments in interferometric technology and their applications to key astronomical targets. In the Galactic Center, interferometry has provided insights into the dynamics and properties of the supermassive black hole and its surrounding environment. The technique has also been instrumental in the characterization of exoplanets, allowing for the direct imaging and atmospheric analysis of these distant worlds. In the realm of active galactic nuclei, interferometry has contributed to our understanding of the structure and kinematics of the central regions, shedding light on the processes driving their immense energy output. Furthermore, studies of young stellar objects have benefited from interferometric observations, revealing the complex interactions and formation processes within protostellar disks. The paper also discusses the application of interferometry to stellar astrophysics, where it has been used to resolve surface features and measure fundamental parameters of stars with high precision. These advancements underscore the critical role of optical/infrared interferometry in expanding our understanding of the universe, paving the way for future discoveries."}
