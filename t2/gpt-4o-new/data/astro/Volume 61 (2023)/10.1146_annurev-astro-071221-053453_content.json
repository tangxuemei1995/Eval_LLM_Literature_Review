{"Abstract": "The formation and evolution of the first stars, known as Population III stars, represent a pivotal epoch in cosmic history, marking the transition from the primordial Universe to one enriched with heavy elements. This study delves into the complex processes that governed the birth of these stars, which formed from pristine gas clouds in the high-redshift Universe. Utilizing advanced cosmological simulations and observational data, we explore the conditions necessary for the formation of Population III stars, including the role of dark matter halos and the cooling mechanisms of primordial gas. We also examine the properties of these stars, which are hypothesized to be massive, short-lived, and influential in the reionization of the Universe. Furthermore, the transition to Population II stars, which formed from gas enriched by the first supernovae, is analyzed to understand the chemical evolution and the subsequent star formation processes. The impact of these early stellar populations on galactic archeology is significant, as they provide insights into the initial mass function, nucleosynthesis, and the early stages of galaxy formation. By integrating theoretical models with high-redshift observations, this research enhances our understanding of the first stars' role in shaping the Universe's structure and composition, offering a comprehensive view of their legacy in the cosmic timeline."}
