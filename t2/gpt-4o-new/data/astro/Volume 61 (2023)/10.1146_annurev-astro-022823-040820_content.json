{"Abstract": "Protoplanetary disks, the birthplaces of planets, are rich in chemical complexity, playing a crucial role in the formation and evolution of planetary systems. This study delves into the intricate chemistry of protoplanetary disks, focusing on the processes that govern the synthesis and distribution of organic and inorganic molecules. Utilizing advanced observational techniques and theoretical models, we explore the influence of disk temperature, density, and radiation fields on chemical reactions. Our findings highlight the significance of astrochemical pathways in the formation of prebiotic molecules, which may seed nascent planets with the building blocks of life. We also examine the impact of stellar and disk dynamics on the spatial and temporal variation of chemical species. By integrating data from recent missions and telescopes, such as ALMA and JWST, this research provides new insights into the initial conditions for planet formation. The results underscore the importance of understanding protoplanetary disk chemistry to unravel the origins of planetary systems and the potential for habitability beyond our solar system."}
