{"Abstract": "The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a pivotal role in the lifecycle of galaxies, acting as a reservoir for gas that fuels star formation and a sink for feedback processes. This study delves into the key physical processes governing the CGM, with a focus on the interplay between galactic halos and the intergalactic medium. Utilizing advanced hydrodynamic simulations, we explore the dynamics of gas accretion, cooling, and feedback mechanisms that shape the CGM's structure and evolution. Our findings highlight the significance of plasma physics in understanding the thermal and ionization states of the CGM, which are crucial for interpreting observational data. We also examine the impact of cosmological parameters on the CGM, providing insights into how variations in dark matter and dark energy influence its properties. Theoretical models are compared against recent observational data, revealing a complex interaction between inflows and outflows that regulate the mass and metallicity of the CGM. This research underscores the importance of multi-scale simulations in capturing the intricate processes at play, offering a comprehensive framework for future studies. By advancing our understanding of the CGM, this work contributes to a broader comprehension of galaxy formation and evolution, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches that consider both local and cosmological influences."}
