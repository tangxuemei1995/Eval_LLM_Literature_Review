{"Abstract": "The ubiquitinâ€“proteasome system (UPS) is a critical regulatory mechanism in plants, orchestrating protein degradation and maintaining proteostasis. This system plays a pivotal role in plant immunity by modulating the stability and activity of key immune components. Pathogens, however, have evolved sophisticated strategies to manipulate the UPS, deploying effectors that hijack ubiquitination processes to suppress host defenses and promote infection. This review explores the intricate interactions between plant UPS and microbial effectors, highlighting recent advances in understanding how pathogens exploit ubiquitination to undermine plant immune responses. By dissecting these molecular interactions, we can identify potential targets for enhancing plant resistance. Understanding the dual role of the UPS in maintaining cellular homeostasis and mediating immune responses offers promising avenues for developing novel strategies to bolster plant defense against pathogenic threats."}
