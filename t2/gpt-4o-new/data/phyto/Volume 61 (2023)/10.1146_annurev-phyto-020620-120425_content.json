{"Abstract": "The reemergence of phycopathology highlights the intersection of algal biology, ecology, and biosecurity, emphasizing the importance of understanding algal diseases in aquaculture and natural ecosystems. This study explores the dynamics of algal parasitology, focusing on the ecological impacts and biosecurity challenges posed by pathogenic interactions. By examining case studies in algal aquaculture, the research identifies key factors influencing disease outbreaks and their ecological consequences. The findings underscore the need for integrated management strategies to mitigate risks and enhance the resilience of algal systems. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of algal ecology and the development of sustainable practices in algal cultivation."}
