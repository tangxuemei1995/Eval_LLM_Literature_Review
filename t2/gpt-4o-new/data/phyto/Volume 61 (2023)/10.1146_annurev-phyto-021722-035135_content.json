{"Abstract": "Induced resistance in fruits and vegetables represents a promising strategy to mitigate postharvest disease development, which is a significant concern for global food security and economic sustainability. This study explores the physiological mechanisms underlying induced resistance, focusing on how these processes can be harnessed to extend the shelf life of produce. By examining the interplay between host physiological factors and external stimuli, we identify key pathways that trigger resistance responses, including the activation of defense-related enzymes and the synthesis of antimicrobial compounds. The research highlights the role of ripening and maturation delay as critical factors in enhancing resistance, providing insights into how these processes can be manipulated to reduce susceptibility to pathogens. Our findings suggest that optimizing induced resistance through targeted interventions could significantly reduce postharvest losses, offering a sustainable alternative to chemical treatments. This study underscores the potential of leveraging natural plant defenses to improve the quality and longevity of fruits and vegetables, contributing to more resilient agricultural practices."}
