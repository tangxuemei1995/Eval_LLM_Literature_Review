{"Abstract": "The increasing demand for sustainable agricultural practices has intensified the search for novel biopesticides, with functional peptides emerging as promising candidates for plant disease control. This review explores the potential of functional peptides derived from natural sources, such as plants, microorganisms, and animals, in combating plant pathogens. Functional peptides exhibit diverse mechanisms of action, including antimicrobial activity, immune modulation, and interference with pathogen signaling pathways, making them versatile tools in plant protection. The study delves into the molecular mechanisms underlying these actions, highlighting their ability to disrupt cell membranes, inhibit enzyme activity, and induce systemic resistance in plants. Advances in peptide synthesis and production technologies, such as recombinant DNA technology and peptide engineering, have facilitated the development of cost-effective and scalable production methods, enhancing the feasibility of their application in agriculture. Furthermore, the review discusses the challenges associated with the stability, delivery, and environmental impact of peptide-based biopesticides, emphasizing the need for innovative formulation strategies to enhance their efficacy and persistence in the field. By integrating functional peptides into integrated pest management systems, it is possible to reduce reliance on chemical pesticides, thereby minimizing environmental impact and promoting sustainable agriculture. This review underscores the potential of functional peptides as a novel class of biopesticides, paving the way for future research and development in plant disease management."}
