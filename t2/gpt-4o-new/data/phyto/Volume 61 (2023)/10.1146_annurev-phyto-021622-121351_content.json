{"Abstract": "Kitaviruses represent a unique group of plant viruses that deviate from the typical systemic infection patterns observed in most plant viruses, instead causing localized, nonsystemic diseases. This review focuses on the genera Cilevirus, Higrevirus, and Blunervirus, which are primarily transmitted by Brevipalpus mites. These viruses are responsible for economically significant diseases such as citrus leprosis, characterized by localized lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits, leading to substantial yield losses. The study of kitaviruses provides insights into the complex interactions between plant hosts, vector mites, and viral pathogens. Recent advances in molecular biology have shed light on the genomic organization and replication strategies of these viruses, revealing similarities with negeviruses, a group of insect-infecting viruses. Understanding the transmission dynamics and host-virus interactions of kitaviruses is crucial for developing effective management strategies. This review highlights the need for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying the atypical infection patterns of kitaviruses and their evolutionary relationship with other plant and insect viruses."}
