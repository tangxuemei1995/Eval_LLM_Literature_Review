{"Abstract": "The Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus (ToBRFV), a member of the Tobamovirus genus, has emerged as a significant threat to global agriculture, particularly affecting tomato and pepper crops. This pandemic has highlighted the vulnerability of these essential crops to viral pathogens, necessitating urgent research and intervention strategies. The virus is primarily seed-borne, facilitating its rapid spread across international borders, and is characterized by its ability to overcome existing genetic resistances in tomato varieties. Effective management of ToBRFV requires a multifaceted approach, including stringent seed hygiene protocols to prevent initial infection and the development of resistant cultivars through advanced breeding techniques. Additionally, the implementation of comprehensive biosecurity measures in agricultural practices is crucial to mitigate the spread of the virus. This review synthesizes current knowledge on ToBRFV, emphasizing the need for coordinated global efforts to enhance resistance breeding, improve diagnostic tools, and establish robust quarantine measures to safeguard the future of tomato and pepper production."}
