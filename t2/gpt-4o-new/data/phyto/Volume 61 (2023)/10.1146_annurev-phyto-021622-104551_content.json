{"Abstract": "Ralstonia solanacearum, a notorious plant pathogen, is responsible for bacterial wilt disease, affecting a wide range of crops globally. This pathogen employs a sophisticated arsenal of virulence strategies, including the secretion of effector proteins and the manipulation of host plant defenses, to establish infection. The evolution of R. solanacearum is shaped by its interactions with diverse plant hosts and environmental conditions, leading to significant genetic diversity and adaptability. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing effective resistance strategies. Recent advances in biological control and the role of plant-associated microbiota offer promising avenues for managing this pathogen. This review synthesizes current knowledge on R. solanacearum's virulence tactics and explores innovative approaches for enhancing plant resistance, aiming to mitigate the impact of this devastating disease on global agriculture."}
