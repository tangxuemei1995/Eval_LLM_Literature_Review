{"Abstract": "Microbiomes, complex communities of microorganisms, play crucial roles in ecosystem functioning and health. Understanding their organization and function requires advanced analytical approaches. This study explores the power of network analyses, focusing on coassociation and co-occurrence patterns, to unravel the intricate relationships within plant and soil microbiomes. By examining network structures, we identify key modules that reveal functional and organizational insights, highlighting the interconnectedness of microbial communities. Our findings demonstrate that network-based approaches provide a more comprehensive understanding of microbial ecology, surpassing traditional methods. This research underscores the importance of considering the microbiome as a holistic entity, where the interactions and network structures are more than the sum of individual components, offering new perspectives for ecological studies and applications in agriculture and environmental management."}
