{"Abstract": "Phytophthora capsici, a notorious oomycete plant pathogen, continues to pose significant threats to vegetable crops worldwide, a century after its initial description. This review synthesizes recent advancements in understanding the fundamental biology of P. capsici, highlighting its complex life cycle, genetic diversity, and mechanisms of pathogenicity. The pathogen's ability to rapidly adapt and develop resistance to fungicides underscores the urgency for innovative management strategies. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular basis of fungicide resistance, offering insights into potential targets for novel control measures. Integrated disease management approaches, combining cultural practices, resistant cultivars, and judicious fungicide use, are emphasized as sustainable solutions. Advances in genomic and transcriptomic technologies have furthered our understanding of host-pathogen interactions, paving the way for the development of resistant crop varieties. This review underscores the need for continued research and collaboration to mitigate the impact of P. capsici on global agriculture."}
