{"Abstract": "The intricate relationship between crops and their associated microbiota plays a crucial role in plant health, growth, and productivity. This study explores the potential of engineering crop microbiota through host genetics, focusing on the rhizosphere and root-associated microbial communities. By examining the genetic basis of plant-microbiota interactions, we aim to identify key genetic traits that influence microbial community composition and function. The domestication of crops has historically altered these interactions, often reducing microbial diversity and resilience. Through advanced plant breeding techniques, it is possible to reintroduce or enhance beneficial microbial associations that have been lost or diminished. This research highlights the importance of understanding the genetic determinants of microbiota assembly and function in the context of crop improvement. By leveraging genetic insights, we can develop crops that are better equipped to harness the benefits of their microbiota, leading to improved nutrient uptake, disease resistance, and stress tolerance. Ultimately, this approach offers a sustainable pathway to enhance agricultural productivity and resilience in the face of global challenges such as climate change and food security. The findings underscore the potential of integrating host genetics with microbiome management in modern plant breeding programs."}
