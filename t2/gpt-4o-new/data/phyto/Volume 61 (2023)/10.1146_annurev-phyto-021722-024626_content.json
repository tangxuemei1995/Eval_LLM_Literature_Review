{"Abstract": "The global forest health crisis, exacerbated by biological invasions and climate change, presents a significant public-good social dilemma requiring urgent international collective action. Forests, vital for biodiversity conservation and climate regulation, are increasingly threatened by invasive species and anthropogenic pressures. This paper explores the intersection of natural resource policy and global change, highlighting the need for coordinated international efforts to address these challenges. Current policies often fall short due to fragmented governance and lack of global cooperation, leading to ineffective management of forest ecosystems. By examining case studies and policy frameworks, this study underscores the importance of integrating scientific research with policy-making to enhance forest resilience. It advocates for a unified global strategy that prioritizes biodiversity conservation and sustainable resource management, emphasizing the role of international collaboration in mitigating the impacts of climate change and biological invasions on forest health."}
