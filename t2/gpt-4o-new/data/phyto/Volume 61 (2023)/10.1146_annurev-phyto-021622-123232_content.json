{"Abstract": "Pathogens have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to subvert plant immune responses, often targeting the host's membrane trafficking pathways. This review explores how microbial effectors manipulate plant endomembrane systems, including autophagy and protein secretion, to facilitate infection. By hijacking these pathways, pathogens can suppress immune signaling and promote the formation of specialized structures like haustoria, which are crucial for nutrient acquisition. Understanding the interplay between pathogen effectors and plant membrane trafficking is essential for developing strategies to enhance plant resistance. Recent advances in molecular techniques have shed light on the dynamic interactions between host and pathogen, revealing potential targets for intervention. This research underscores the complexity of plant-pathogen interactions and the critical role of membrane trafficking in plant immunity."}
