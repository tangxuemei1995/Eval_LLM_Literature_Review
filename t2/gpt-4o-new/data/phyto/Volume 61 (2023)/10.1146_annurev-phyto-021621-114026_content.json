{"Abstract": "The intricate interplay between plant-pathogenic bacteria and their host plants is a dynamic battlefield where communication is key. Recent research has illuminated the role of host-derived metabolites as pivotal signals that modulate bacterial virulence. These metabolites act as inter-kingdom messengers, influencing the expression of bacterial effectors and the activity of the type III secretion system, a critical virulence mechanism. By deciphering these metabolic signals, bacteria can fine-tune their pathogenic strategies, either enhancing or suppressing virulence in response to the host's immune status. This review synthesizes current findings on the molecular mechanisms underlying this metabolic signaling, highlighting its impact on bacterial adaptability and pathogenicity. Understanding these processes opens new avenues for developing innovative strategies to bolster plant immunity and mitigate bacterial infections, offering potential for sustainable agricultural practices. The study underscores the complexity of host-pathogen interactions and the sophisticated communication networks that govern them."}
