{"Abstract": "The intricate dance of coevolution between viruses and their plant hosts is a dynamic process that has shaped the genetic landscape of both parties over millennia. This study delves into the coevolutionary interactions within geographic centers of plant diversity, with a focus on the Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) and its host plants. By examining these interactions, we aim to understand how historical and environmental factors, such as plate tectonics, have influenced the distribution and evolution of host resistance and viral pathogenicity. Our research highlights the significance of crop centers of diversity as hotspots for host–pathogen coevolution, where diverse genetic resources provide a reservoir for resistance traits. Through a combination of phylogenetic analysis and ecological modeling, we explore the evolutionary trajectories of both viruses and host plants, revealing patterns of adaptation and counter-adaptation. The findings underscore the importance of preserving these centers of diversity, not only for their ecological value but also for their potential to inform sustainable agricultural practices. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of host–microbe interactions and offers insights into the development of resilient crop varieties in the face of emerging viral threats."}
