{"Abstract": "The global agricultural landscape is undergoing significant transitions, necessitating innovative approaches to pest management, particularly for nematodes, which pose substantial threats to crop productivity. This study explores the multifaceted strategies of Integrated Nematode Management (INM) in the context of evolving constraints, policies, and technological advancements. Emphasizing the role of the microbiome and genetic insights, the research highlights genome editing as a promising tool for enhancing root health and nematode resistance. The integration of remote sensing technologies offers novel opportunities for real-time monitoring and precise management of nematode populations. Policy frameworks are examined to identify barriers and enablers for the adoption of these advanced processes. By synthesizing current knowledge and future prospects, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of INM strategies that align with sustainable agricultural practices, ensuring food security in a rapidly changing world. The findings underscore the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in addressing the complex challenges of nematode management."}
