{"Abstract": "Downy mildew, caused by oomycetes, poses significant threats to global agriculture, necessitating advanced genomic insights for effective management. This study leverages telomere-to-telomere genome assemblies to unravel the complex biology and evolutionary dynamics of these pathogens. By focusing on effector proteins, which play crucial roles in host-pathogen interactions, we elucidate mechanisms of pathogenicity and host specificity. Our findings highlight the role of heterokaryosis in promoting genetic diversity and somatic adaptation, enabling rapid responses to environmental pressures and host defenses. This genomic perspective also enhances biosurveillance capabilities, facilitating early detection and monitoring of pathogen populations. Through comprehensive genomic analyses, we provide a framework for understanding the evolutionary trajectories of downy mildew pathogens, offering potential targets for novel control strategies. This research underscores the importance of integrating genomic data into plant pathology, paving the way for innovative approaches to mitigate the impact of oomycete-induced diseases on agriculture."}
