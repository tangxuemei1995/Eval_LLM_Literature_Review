{"Abstract": "The global trade of ornamental plants is a significant economic activity, yet it poses challenges due to the spread of viral and bacterial diseases. This study examines the local effects of such pathogens on flower production, focusing on the economic and ecological impacts. Viral and bacterial infections can lead to substantial losses in ornamental plant quality and yield, affecting both producers and consumers. The research highlights the role of international trade in facilitating the spread of these diseases, emphasizing the need for stringent regulatory measures. By analyzing case studies and current regulatory frameworks, the study identifies gaps in existing policies and suggests improvements to mitigate disease transmission. The findings underscore the importance of international cooperation and the implementation of advanced diagnostic tools to safeguard the ornamental plant industry. This research contributes to a better understanding of the complex interplay between global trade and local agricultural health, offering insights for policymakers and stakeholders."}
