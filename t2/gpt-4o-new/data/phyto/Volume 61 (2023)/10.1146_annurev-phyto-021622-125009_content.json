{"Abstract": "Agrobacterium species, renowned for their role as phytopathogens, offer a unique perspective on the interplay between virulence and ecological adaptation through the lens of evolutionary genomics. This study delves into the genomic architecture of Agrobacteria, emphasizing the role of plasmids in facilitating horizontal gene transfer and enhancing pathogenicity. By analyzing genomic sequences, we identify key virulence factors and trace their evolutionary trajectories, revealing insights into the mechanisms driving host specificity and adaptation. The research highlights the dynamic nature of Agrobacterial genomes, shaped by ecological pressures and evolutionary forces, which contribute to their success as plant pathogens. Furthermore, the study explores the ecological niches occupied by Agrobacteria, examining how environmental factors influence genomic diversity and virulence. This comprehensive genomic analysis not only advances our understanding of Agrobacterial evolution but also provides a framework for developing strategies to mitigate their impact on agriculture."}
