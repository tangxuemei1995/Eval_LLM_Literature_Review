{"Abstract": "This study explores the unique biological and evolutionary adaptations of female masculinization in talpid moles and spotted hyenas, focusing on their reproductive and behavioral traits. Both species exhibit remarkable female characteristics, such as the presence of ovotestes in moles and the development of a pseudopenis in hyenas, which are linked to elevated androgen levels. These adaptations are hypothesized to confer advantages in social dominance and reproductive success, facilitating aggressive behavior that is typically associated with males. The research delves into the genetic and hormonal mechanisms underlying these traits, examining how they have evolved in response to environmental pressures and social structures. By comparing these two distinct species, the study provides insights into the convergent evolution of female masculinization and its implications for understanding sexual dimorphism and adaptive strategies in mammals. This work contributes to a broader understanding of the evolutionary biology of gender and reproductive strategies."}
