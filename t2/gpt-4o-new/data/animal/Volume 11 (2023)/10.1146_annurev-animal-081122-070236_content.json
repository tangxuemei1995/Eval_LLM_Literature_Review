{"Abstract": "The therapeutic potential of cannabidiol (CBD) in veterinary medicine, particularly for dogs and cats, is gaining attention due to its anxiolytic, anti-inflammatory, and anticonvulsant properties. This review examines the pharmacokinetics of CBD in these species, highlighting its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Current studies suggest that CBD may effectively manage anxiety and inflammation, with promising results in reducing seizure frequency in epileptic animals. However, the pharmacokinetic profile varies significantly between dogs and cats, necessitating species-specific dosing regimens. Regulatory challenges persist, as the legal status of CBD products for pets remains ambiguous in many regions. Further research is needed to establish standardized dosing guidelines and to fully understand the long-term effects of CBD use in companion animals. This paper underscores the importance of rigorous scientific validation to ensure the safe and effective integration of CBD into veterinary practice."}
