{"Abstract": "Insect populations worldwide are experiencing unprecedented declines, posing significant threats to biodiversity and ecosystem services. Population genomics offers a powerful framework for understanding the genetic underpinnings of these declines and informing conservation strategies. This study explores the application of conservation genomics to insect populations, focusing on genome assembly, genetic adaptation, and the role of deleterious mutations. By leveraging high-throughput sequencing technologies, we can assemble comprehensive insect genomes, providing insights into genetic diversity and population structure. These genomic resources enable the identification of adaptive genetic variation that may confer resilience to environmental changes, such as climate change and habitat loss. Furthermore, the study examines the accumulation of deleterious mutations in small, isolated populations, which can exacerbate extinction risks. Through comparative genomics, we can assess the genetic health of insect populations and identify conservation priorities. The integration of genomic data with ecological and environmental information allows for the development of targeted conservation strategies, such as assisted gene flow and habitat restoration. This research underscores the importance of population genomics in addressing the challenges of insect conservation, highlighting the need for collaborative efforts to preserve insect biodiversity and maintain ecosystem functionality. Ultimately, this approach aims to mitigate the impacts of insect declines and promote sustainable conservation practices."}
