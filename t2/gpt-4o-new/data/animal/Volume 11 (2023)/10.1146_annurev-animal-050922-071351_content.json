{"Abstract": "The evolution of vertebrate hormones and their receptors is a pivotal aspect of understanding vertebrate physiology and adaptation. This study delves into the genomic data of non-osteichthyan species, particularly cartilaginous fishes and cyclostomes, to trace the evolutionary trajectories of key hormones such as leptin, oxytocin, vasopressin, prolactin, and ghrelin. By analyzing these ancient lineages, we uncover the molecular innovations and diversifications that predate the osteichthyan lineage, offering insights into the ancestral roles and regulatory mechanisms of these hormones. Our findings suggest that the hormonal systems in these early vertebrates exhibit both conserved and unique features, reflecting their ecological niches and evolutionary pressures. This research not only enhances our understanding of vertebrate endocrinology but also provides a framework for exploring the functional evolution of hormone-receptor interactions across diverse vertebrate taxa."}
