{"Abstract": "Deleterious mutations, which can accumulate in natural populations, pose significant challenges for conservation biology. This study explores the implications of genetic load and inbreeding depression on the viability of small and isolated populations. Using advanced simulation models, we assess the impact of deleterious variation on population fitness and survival. Our findings indicate that genetic load can exacerbate the effects of inbreeding depression, leading to reduced reproductive success and increased extinction risk. The simulations highlight the importance of maintaining genetic diversity to mitigate these effects. Conservation strategies should prioritize genetic monitoring and management to minimize the accumulation of harmful mutations. This research underscores the need for integrated approaches that combine genetic data with ecological and demographic factors to enhance the resilience of endangered species. Our results provide critical insights for developing effective conservation policies aimed at preserving biodiversity in the face of genetic challenges."}
