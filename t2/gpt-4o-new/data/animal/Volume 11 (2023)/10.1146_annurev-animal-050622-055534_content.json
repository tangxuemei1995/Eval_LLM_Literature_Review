{"Abstract": "The study of genetic risk factors in Canis lupus familiaris offers significant insights into both monogenic and complex diseases, enhancing our understanding of veterinary and human medicine. Utilizing advanced genomic technologies, this research identifies specific genetic variants associated with canine diseases, providing a foundation for precision medicine in veterinary practice. The findings underscore the importance of dogs as a model for human diseases, aligning with the One Health initiative that emphasizes interconnected health of humans, animals, and ecosystems. By elucidating genetic predispositions, this study contributes to improved diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic strategies, ultimately advancing the field of veterinary medicine and offering translational benefits to human health."}
