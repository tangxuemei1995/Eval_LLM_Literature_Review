{"Abstract": "In a rapidly changing world, zoos and aquariums play a pivotal role in biodiversity conservation and environmental education. This study examines their contributions to captive breeding and species reintroduction programs, which are crucial for preserving endangered species. By providing controlled environments, these institutions facilitate scientific research that enhances our understanding of animal behavior, genetics, and ecology. Furthermore, zoos and aquariums serve as educational platforms, raising public awareness about environmental issues and promoting conservation efforts. However, the ethical considerations of animal welfare remain a significant concern, necessitating ongoing evaluation and improvement of living conditions. This research underscores the importance of balancing conservation goals with ethical responsibilities, highlighting the need for zoos and aquariums to adapt and innovate in response to global environmental challenges."}
