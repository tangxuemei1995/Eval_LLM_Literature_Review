{"Abstract": "This review explores the integration of Indigenous perspectives within the field of animal biosciences, emphasizing the contributions of American Indian and Native American knowledge systems. By examining the intersection of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and contemporary scientific practices, the study highlights the potential for a more holistic approach to animal health and management. The One Health framework, which recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, serves as a pivotal concept in bridging these diverse knowledge systems. Indigenous perspectives offer valuable insights into sustainable practices and biodiversity conservation, challenging conventional methodologies in animal sciences. This review underscores the importance of respecting and incorporating Indigenous knowledge to enhance scientific understanding and address global challenges in animal health. The findings advocate for collaborative efforts between Indigenous communities and scientific researchers to foster innovation and resilience in the face of ecological and health-related challenges."}
