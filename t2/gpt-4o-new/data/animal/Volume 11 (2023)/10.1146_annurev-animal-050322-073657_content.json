{"Abstract": "Biologging and biotelemetry have revolutionized the study of marine animals, offering unprecedented insights into their movement ecology, field physiology, and interactions within their ecosystems. These technologies enable researchers to track the spatial and temporal patterns of marine species, shedding light on predatorâ€“prey dynamics and social interactions that are otherwise challenging to observe. By providing detailed data on the physiological responses of marine animals to environmental changes, biologging and biotelemetry facilitate a deeper understanding of how these species adapt to natural and anthropogenic stressors. This research is crucial for assessing the impacts of human activities, such as climate change and pollution, on marine biodiversity. The integration of these tools into marine research not only enhances our knowledge of marine life but also informs conservation strategies aimed at mitigating the effects of human-induced pressures on ocean ecosystems. This paper reviews recent advancements and applications of these technologies in marine research."}
