{"Abstract": "The emergence of human-infecting coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, underscores the critical need to understand zoonotic reservoirs and cross-species transmission dynamics. This study reviews the role of animal models in elucidating the mechanisms of coronavirus spillover from wildlife to humans. We explore the genetic recombination events that facilitate viral adaptation and highlight the importance of identifying and monitoring potential zoonotic reservoirs, including bats and intermediate hosts like camels and civets. The review emphasizes the utility of animal models in simulating human disease, providing insights into viral pathogenesis, immune response, and transmission pathways. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of cross-species transmission for public health surveillance and the development of preventive strategies. By integrating data from virology, ecology, and epidemiology, this research aims to enhance our understanding of the factors driving coronavirus emergence and inform the design of effective surveillance systems. Ultimately, this work contributes to the global effort to predict and mitigate future zoonotic outbreaks, safeguarding human health against emerging infectious diseases."}
