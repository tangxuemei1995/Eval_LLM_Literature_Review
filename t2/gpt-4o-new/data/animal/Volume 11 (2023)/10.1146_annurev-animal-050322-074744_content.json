{"Abstract": "The naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) has emerged as a remarkable model for studying healthy aging due to its exceptional longevity and resistance to age-related diseases, such as cancer. This eusocial rodent, native to East Africa, exhibits a lifespan significantly longer than that of other rodents, often exceeding 30 years. Key factors contributing to its longevity include unique cellular mechanisms that enhance genomic stability, efficient protein homeostasis, and a robust antioxidant defense system. Additionally, the naked mole-rat's ability to thrive in low-oxygen environments (hypoxia) and its complex social structure provide insights into the interplay between environmental adaptation and sociality in promoting healthspan. Understanding these mechanisms offers potential translational applications for human aging and age-related diseases. This review synthesizes current research on the biological and environmental factors underpinning the naked mole-rat's resistance to aging, highlighting its potential as a model organism for developing interventions to promote healthy aging in humans."}
