{"Abstract": "Domestic animals play a crucial role in the epidemiology of zoonotic viral diseases, acting as potential reservoir hosts that facilitate the transmission of pathogens to humans. This study explores the dynamics of emerging and endemic viral zoonoses within domestic animal populations, emphasizing their significance in the context of global health threats and pandemics. By integrating the One Health approach, which considers the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, this research highlights the necessity of monitoring domestic animals for early detection and control of zoonotic viruses. The findings underscore the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in identifying and mitigating the risks posed by these animals as reservoirs, ultimately contributing to the development of effective strategies for preventing future outbreaks. This work calls for enhanced surveillance and research efforts to better understand the complex interactions between domestic animals and zoonotic viral pathogens."}
