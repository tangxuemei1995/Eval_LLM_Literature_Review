{"Abstract": "The persistence of recessive lethal alleles in natural populations poses intriguing questions about the underlying evolutionary mechanisms. This study explores the roles of mutation–selection balance, heterozygote advantage, and linked selection in maintaining such genetic variation. Mutation–selection balance suggests that recurrent mutations introduce lethal alleles, which are then purged by selection. However, heterozygote advantage, where heterozygotes exhibit superior fitness, may also contribute to the retention of these alleles. Additionally, associative overdominance, a form of linked selection, can preserve lethal alleles when they are in linkage disequilibrium with beneficial alleles, potentially forming supergenes. By integrating theoretical models with empirical data, this research elucidates the complex interplay of these mechanisms, highlighting their relative contributions to genetic diversity. The findings underscore the importance of considering multiple evolutionary forces in understanding the maintenance of deleterious alleles, offering insights into broader questions of genetic variation and adaptation in natural populations."}
