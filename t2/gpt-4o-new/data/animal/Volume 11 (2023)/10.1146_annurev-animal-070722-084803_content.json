{"Abstract": "The increasing prevalence of wildlife poaching necessitates robust forensic methodologies to support legal proceedings. This study explores the integration of forensic science in the courtroom, focusing on the use of DNA evidence to identify animal victims and link them to criminal activities. By examining case studies where DNA analysis has been pivotal, we highlight the challenges and advancements in wildlife crime investigations. The research underscores the importance of developing standardized protocols for collecting and analyzing biological samples from poached animals. Furthermore, it discusses the role of forensic evidence in securing convictions and deterring future crimes. The findings advocate for enhanced collaboration between scientists, law enforcement, and legal professionals to strengthen the judicial process in wildlife crime cases, ultimately contributing to the conservation of endangered species and the protection of biodiversity."}
