{"Abstract": "Cephalopods, renowned for their complex nervous systems and behavioral sophistication, exhibit extensive RNA editing, particularly in neural tissues. This study investigates the role of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes in the recoding of the neural proteome in cephalopods. By analyzing transcriptomes from various cephalopod species, we identified a high prevalence of RNA editing events, suggesting a significant contribution to proteomic diversity. These editing events predominantly occur in coding regions, leading to amino acid substitutions that may enhance neural function and adaptability. Our findings highlight the evolutionary significance of RNA editing as a mechanism for rapid adaptation in cephalopods, potentially underpinning their cognitive and behavioral complexity. This extensive recoding of the neural proteome through RNA editing underscores the importance of post-transcriptional modifications in the evolution of complex traits, offering insights into the molecular underpinnings of cephalopod intelligence and adaptability."}
