{"Abstract": "Single-cell multiomics is an emerging field that integrates diverse omics data at the single-cell level, offering unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity and function. This approach combines next-generation sequencing technologies with advanced computational methods to simultaneously analyze genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic data from individual cells. The integration of multimodal data provides a comprehensive view of cellular states and dynamics, enabling the identification of novel cell types and the elucidation of complex biological processes. Recent advancements in computational tools have facilitated the effective integration and interpretation of multiomics data, addressing challenges such as data sparsity and noise. This review highlights the latest developments in single-cell multiomics technologies and computational strategies, emphasizing their applications in understanding disease mechanisms, developmental biology, and tissue architecture. As the field progresses, single-cell multiomics is poised to revolutionize personalized medicine and therapeutic interventions by providing a detailed molecular map of cellular diversity and interactions."}
