{"Abstract": "Breast cancer remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among women worldwide, necessitating improved methods for risk assessment and personalized treatment strategies. This study explores the integration of molecular and radiomic features to enhance risk stratification in breast cancer patients. We focus on the combination of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and polygenic risk scores (PRS) with advanced radiomic analysis derived from imaging modalities such as MRI and mammography. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we assess the predictive power of these combined features in identifying high-risk individuals. Our findings suggest that the integration of SNPs and PRS with radiomic data significantly improves the accuracy of risk prediction models compared to traditional methods. This approach not only facilitates early detection but also aids in tailoring personalized treatment plans, potentially improving patient outcomes. The study underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in cancer research, highlighting the potential of combining genetic and imaging data to refine risk assessment and enhance clinical decision-making in breast cancer management."}
