{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has highlighted the critical role of human genomics in understanding disease susceptibility and severity. This study investigates the contributions of both rare and common genetic variants to the development of COVID-19 pneumonia. Utilizing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and sequencing data, we identify genetic loci associated with increased risk of severe respiratory complications. Our findings emphasize the significance of inborn errors of immunity, particularly those affecting type I interferon pathways, in predisposing individuals to severe COVID-19 outcomes. Rare variants in genes involved in immune response modulation were found to have a substantial impact, while common variants provided insights into population-level susceptibility. This research underscores the importance of integrating genetic data to unravel the complex interplay between host genetics and viral pathogenesis, offering potential avenues for personalized therapeutic strategies and informing public health interventions aimed at mitigating the impact of future pandemics."}
