{"Abstract": "The development of broad-spectrum vaccines against rapidly mutating viruses such as influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and HIV remains a formidable challenge in the field of immunology. These viruses exhibit high mutation rates, enabling them to evade immune responses and rendering traditional vaccine approaches less effective. Recent advances in understanding viral evolution and immune system interactions have spurred innovative strategies aimed at achieving broad-spectrum immunity. Central to these efforts is the identification and utilization of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that target conserved viral epitopes, offering potential cross-protection against diverse viral strains. Additionally, novel vaccine platforms, including mRNA and vector-based technologies, are being explored to enhance the breadth and durability of immune responses. Despite these advancements, significant hurdles remain, including the need for comprehensive epitope mapping and the optimization of vaccine delivery systems to elicit robust and long-lasting immunity. This review synthesizes current progress and ongoing challenges in the quest for universal vaccines, highlighting the critical role of interdisciplinary research in overcoming the complexities posed by rapidly mutating viruses. Continued innovation and collaboration are essential to achieving the goal of broad-spectrum vaccines, which hold promise for mitigating future pandemics."}
