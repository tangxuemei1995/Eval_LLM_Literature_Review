{"Abstract": "The integration of diversity in precision medicine is crucial for enhancing the generalizability of genetic associations across different ancestry groups, thereby improving the identification of disease susceptibility variants. This study examines the role of diverse cohorts and consortia in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to ensure that polygenic risk scores (PRS) are applicable to a broad range of populations. Historically, the underrepresentation of non-European ancestry groups in genetic research has led to biased risk predictions and limited the effectiveness of precision medicine. By incorporating diverse genetic data, researchers can better understand the genetic architecture of diseases and develop more accurate PRS. This approach not only enhances the predictive power of genetic tests but also ensures equitable healthcare outcomes across populations. The findings underscore the necessity of fostering diversity in genetic research to achieve the full potential of precision medicine. Future efforts should focus on expanding diverse genomic databases and fostering international collaborations to address the disparities in genetic research and healthcare delivery."}
