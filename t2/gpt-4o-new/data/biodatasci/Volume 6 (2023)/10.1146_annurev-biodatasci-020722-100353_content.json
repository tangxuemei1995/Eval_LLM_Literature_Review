{"Abstract": "This study explores the integration of statistical learning methods in neuroimaging data analysis, emphasizing applications in understanding causal pathways and heterogeneity in brain function. By leveraging advanced image processing techniques, we aim to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of neuroimaging studies. The research focuses on population-based statistical analysis to identify patterns and variations across diverse cohorts, facilitating personalized insights into neurological conditions. We discuss the implications of study design in capturing complex neural dynamics and propose methodologies to address challenges in data heterogeneity. Our findings underscore the potential of statistical learning to revolutionize neuroimaging, offering robust frameworks for elucidating brain-behavior relationships and informing clinical interventions."}
