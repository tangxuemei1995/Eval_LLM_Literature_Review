{"Abstract": "Single-cell proteomics has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding cellular heterogeneity and function. This review explores computational methods tailored for single-cell proteomics, focusing on mass cytometry and spatial proteomics. We discuss advanced data analysis techniques, including clustering algorithms that identify distinct cell populations and trajectory inference methods that map cellular differentiation pathways. Emphasis is placed on the integration of high-dimensional data and the challenges of noise reduction and data normalization. By leveraging these computational approaches, researchers can gain deeper insights into cellular processes, ultimately advancing our understanding of complex biological systems. Future directions include enhancing computational efficiency and developing more robust analytical frameworks."}
