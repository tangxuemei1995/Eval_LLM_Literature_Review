{"Abstract": "The human microbiome plays a crucial role in health and disease, offering new insights for biomedical data scientists. This review explores the methodologies of 16S rRNA gene sequencing and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in microbiome research. 16S sequencing provides a cost-effective approach for profiling microbial communities, while WGS offers comprehensive insights into microbial genomes. The integration of these sequencing techniques with advanced data science tools enables the identification of microbial patterns associated with diseases. Challenges such as data complexity, standardization, and interpretation are discussed, highlighting the need for robust computational frameworks. This synthesis aims to equip data scientists with the knowledge to harness microbiome data, fostering advancements in personalized medicine and therapeutic interventions."}
