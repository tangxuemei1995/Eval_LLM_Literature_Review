{"Abstract": "The genomic analysis of admixed populations presents unique challenges and opportunities in understanding complex traits. This study reviews current strategies and methodologies employed in the statistical genetics of admixed groups, emphasizing the integration of ancestry information to enhance genomic insights. We explore advanced computational methods that account for the intricate genetic architecture resulting from admixture, including novel algorithms for ancestry inference and admixture mapping. The paper highlights the importance of leveraging diverse genetic backgrounds to improve the resolution of association studies and the identification of trait-associated loci. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these strategies for personalized medicine and the potential to uncover genetic variants that are rare or absent in non-admixed populations. By addressing the complexities of admixture, this research aims to refine genomic analyses and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of human genetic diversity."}
