{"Abstract": "The study of aging hallmarks at the single-cell level offers unprecedented insights into the mechanisms driving cellular senescence and organismal aging. This research focuses on developing advanced analysis tools and data resources to decode these hallmarks, identifying potential intervention targets. By leveraging single-cell technologies, we can dissect the heterogeneity of aging processes across different cell types and tissues, providing a comprehensive understanding of the molecular and cellular changes associated with aging. This approach not only enhances our knowledge of aging mechanisms but also facilitates the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies to mitigate age-related diseases. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating single-cell analysis in aging research to unravel complex biological processes and improve healthspan."}
