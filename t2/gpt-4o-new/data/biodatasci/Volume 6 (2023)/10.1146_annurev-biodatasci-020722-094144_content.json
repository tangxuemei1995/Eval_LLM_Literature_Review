{"Abstract": "Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) utilizing circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and RNA (cfRNA) has revolutionized prenatal care by offering a safer alternative to traditional invasive methods. This review explores recent advances in liquid biopsy technologies that enhance the sensitivity and specificity of NIPT, enabling early detection of chromosomal abnormalities and genetic disorders. The integration of genomics into NIPT has expanded its scope, allowing for comprehensive fetal genetic profiling. Despite these advancements, challenges such as the interpretation of complex genomic data, ethical considerations, and accessibility remain. The potential of cfRNA to provide insights into fetal development and maternal health is also discussed, highlighting future possibilities for personalized prenatal care. Continued research and technological innovation are essential to overcome current limitations and fully realize the potential of NIPT in clinical practice."}
