{"Abstract": "The increasing reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) in biomedical research and healthcare has highlighted significant challenges related to data inequality, particularly across diverse populations. This study explores the implications of data inequality on health equity, emphasizing the need for AI models that are robust to subpopulation shifts. We examine the potential of multiethnic machine learning approaches to mitigate biases inherent in current datasets, which often underrepresent minority groups. By leveraging transfer learning techniques, we propose strategies to enhance model generalizability across diverse demographic groups. Our findings suggest that addressing data inequality through these AI methodologies can lead to more equitable healthcare outcomes. This research underscores the importance of developing AI systems that are not only technically proficient but also socially responsible, ensuring that advancements in biomedical AI benefit all segments of the population equitably."}
