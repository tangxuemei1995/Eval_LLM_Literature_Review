{"Abstract": "Deep generative models, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), have emerged as powerful tools in functional and evolutionary genomics. These models offer novel approaches for understanding complex biological data by capturing intricate patterns and generating realistic synthetic data. In functional genomics, deep generative models facilitate the exploration of gene expression patterns and regulatory networks, enhancing our understanding of gene function and interaction. In evolutionary genetics, they enable the simulation of evolutionary processes and the prediction of genetic variation, providing insights into evolutionary dynamics and adaptation. This overview highlights recent advancements in the application of deep generative models, emphasizing their potential to revolutionize genomic research by offering new perspectives and methodologies for data analysis and interpretation."}
