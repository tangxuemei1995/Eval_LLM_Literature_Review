{"Abstract": "The intricate web of gene interactions, or epistasis, plays a pivotal role in the genetic architecture of human diseases, offering new insights into their etiology and progression. Recent advancements in multiomics technologies have significantly enhanced our ability to dissect these complex interactions, providing a more comprehensive understanding of how genetic variants contribute to disease phenotypes. This review synthesizes current evidence on the role of epistasis in human disease studies, highlighting its implications for precision medicine. By integrating data from genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, researchers are uncovering novel gene-gene interactions that were previously obscured in single-omic studies. These findings underscore the necessity of considering epistatic effects in genetic analyses to improve the accuracy of disease risk predictions and the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, the review discusses methodological advancements in computational tools and statistical models that facilitate the identification and interpretation of epistatic interactions. As evidence continues to mount, it becomes increasingly clear that a paradigm shift towards incorporating epistasis in genetic research is essential for advancing our understanding of human diseases and enhancing the precision of medical interventions."}
