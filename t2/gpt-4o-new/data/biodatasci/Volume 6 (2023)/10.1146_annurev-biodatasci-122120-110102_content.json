{"Abstract": "The identification of functional sequences and variants in noncoding DNA is crucial for understanding gene regulation and its implications in health and disease. This study leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze whole genome sequencing data, focusing on enhancer regions and transcriptional elements. By integrating genome-wide association studies, we aim to predict the effects of rare variants on gene expression. Our approach enhances the accuracy of variant effect prediction, providing insights into the regulatory mechanisms of noncoding regions. This research advances the field of sequence analysis, offering a comprehensive framework for identifying functional noncoding sequences and their potential impact on genetic disorders."}
