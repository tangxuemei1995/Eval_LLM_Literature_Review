{"Abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a transformative technology for unraveling the complexities of human cancers at an unprecedented resolution. By enabling the analysis of gene expression at the individual cell level, scRNA-seq provides insights into the heterogeneity of tumor cells and the diverse cell types within the tumor microenvironment. This approach facilitates the identification of rare cell populations, elucidates cellular interactions, and uncovers mechanisms of tumor progression and resistance to therapies. Integrating scRNA-seq data with advanced bioinformatics tools enhances our understanding of cancer biology and informs the development of targeted immunotherapies. As scRNA-seq continues to evolve, it holds promise for personalized cancer treatment strategies, offering a pathway to more effective and precise interventions in oncology."}
