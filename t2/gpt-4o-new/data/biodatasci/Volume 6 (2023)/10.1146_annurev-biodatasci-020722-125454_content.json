{"Abstract": "The intersection of data science and machine learning with neuropsychiatric research offers promising avenues for advancing our understanding of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This review synthesizes current methodologies and applications of digital phenotyping in autism, emphasizing the role of machine learning in identifying and characterizing the neuropsychiatric phenotype of ASD. We explore how digital health technologies, including wearable devices and mobile applications, facilitate the collection of large-scale, real-time data, enabling more nuanced insights into the behavioral and cognitive patterns associated with autism. Crowdsourcing emerges as a pivotal strategy in this domain, allowing for the aggregation of diverse datasets that enhance the robustness of machine learning models. The review highlights key challenges, such as data privacy, ethical considerations, and the need for standardized protocols, which must be addressed to fully leverage these technologies. Furthermore, we propose a roadmap for future research, advocating for interdisciplinary collaboration and the integration of digital psychiatry tools into clinical practice. By harnessing the power of machine learning and digital phenotyping, we can move towards more personalized and effective interventions for individuals with autism, ultimately improving outcomes and quality of life. This roadmap aims to guide researchers and practitioners in navigating the complexities of digital health innovations in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders."}
