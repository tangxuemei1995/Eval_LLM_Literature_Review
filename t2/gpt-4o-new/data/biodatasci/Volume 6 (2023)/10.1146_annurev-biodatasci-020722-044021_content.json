{"Abstract": "The identification of splice variants and isoforms is crucial for understanding the complexity of gene expression and protein function. This study explores the integration of transcriptomics and proteomics to identify alternative splicing events and their resultant protein isoforms. Utilizing both short-read and long-read RNA sequencing technologies, we provide a comprehensive analysis of transcript variants, highlighting the advantages of long-read RNA-seq in capturing full-length transcripts. Concurrently, top-down mass spectrometry is employed to characterize proteoforms, offering insights into the diversity of protein isoforms resulting from alternative splicing. Our findings demonstrate the complementary nature of these advanced methodologies in elucidating the landscape of splice variants and isoforms. This integrative approach not only enhances the accuracy of isoform identification but also provides a deeper understanding of the functional implications of alternative splicing in various biological contexts. The study underscores the potential of combining transcriptomic and proteomic data to advance precision medicine."}
