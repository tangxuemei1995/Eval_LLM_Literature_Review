{"Abstract": "Virus-derived small RNAs, including virally encoded microRNAs (v-miRNAs), play crucial roles in host-pathogen interactions, influencing both viral pathogenesis and host immune responses. This review explores the biogenesis and functional implications of v-miRNAs, with a focus on Epsteinâ€“Barr virus, a model organism for studying viral microRNA functions. Advances in bioinformatics have facilitated the identification and characterization of these small RNAs, providing insights into their regulatory networks. We discuss the current state of viral RNA bioinformatics resources, highlighting their applications in understanding the role of v-miRNAs in health and disease. This knowledge is pivotal for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting viral infections and associated diseases."}
