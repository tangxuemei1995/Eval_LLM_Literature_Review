{"Abstract": "Hepcidin, a key regulator of iron homeostasis, plays a crucial role in maintaining iron balance in the body. It modulates iron absorption and distribution by binding to the iron exporter ferroportin, leading to its degradation. Dysregulation of hepcidin is implicated in various disorders, including anemia of inflammation and iron overload conditions such as hereditary hemochromatosis. Inflammatory cytokines can upregulate hepcidin expression, contributing to anemia by limiting iron availability. Conversely, low hepcidin levels can result in excessive iron accumulation. Understanding the mechanisms governing hepcidin regulation offers potential therapeutic targets for managing iron-related diseases."}
