{"Abstract": "The ISCHEMIA trial has provided pivotal insights into the management of stable ischemic heart disease, challenging traditional paradigms. This study compared invasive strategies, including revascularization, with optimal medical therapy alone in patients with stable angina and moderate to severe myocardial ischemia. Results indicated no significant difference in major adverse cardiovascular events between the two approaches, emphasizing the efficacy of conservative management. These findings advocate for a tailored treatment strategy, prioritizing patient-specific factors and preferences. The trial underscores the importance of optimal medical therapy as a cornerstone in managing stable ischemic heart disease, potentially reshaping clinical guidelines."}
