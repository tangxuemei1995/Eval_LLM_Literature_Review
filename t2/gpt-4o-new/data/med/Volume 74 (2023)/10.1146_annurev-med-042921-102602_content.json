{"Abstract": "Erythropoiesis, the process of red blood cell production, is critically regulated by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway, which responds to oxygen availability. This study explores the effects of genetic and pharmacological perturbations on erythropoiesis, particularly in the context of chronic kidney disease (CKD), where erythropoietin production is impaired. We investigate the role of HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs) as a novel class of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) that stabilize HIF, enhancing erythropoietin synthesis and improving anemia management in CKD patients. Our findings indicate that HIF-PHIs effectively stimulate erythropoiesis, offering a potential alternative to traditional ESAs. However, the study also highlights the risk of thromboembolism associated with these agents, necessitating careful patient selection and monitoring. This research underscores the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms governing erythropoiesis and the need for personalized therapeutic strategies to optimize treatment outcomes while minimizing adverse effects."}
