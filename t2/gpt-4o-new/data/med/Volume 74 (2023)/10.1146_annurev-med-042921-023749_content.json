{"Abstract": "The accumulation of tau protein and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles are hallmark features of Alzheimer's disease, yet much remains unknown about the invisible aspects of tau pathology. This review explores the latest advancements in understanding tau's role as a biomarker and its potential as a therapeutic target. We discuss novel imaging techniques and molecular approaches that reveal previously undetectable tau species, offering insights into disease progression and diagnosis. Furthermore, we evaluate emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating tau pathology, highlighting their promise and challenges. This comprehensive analysis underscores the critical need for continued research to unravel the complexities of tau in Alzheimer's disease."}
