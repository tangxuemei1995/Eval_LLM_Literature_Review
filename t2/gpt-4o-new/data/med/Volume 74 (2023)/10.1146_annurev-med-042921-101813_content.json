{"Abstract": "The study of genetic kidney disease has unveiled the significant impact of rare disorders on the broader spectrum of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Utilizing massively parallel sequencing and collapsing analysis, researchers have identified novel genetic variants that contribute to CKD, highlighting the importance of genomics in understanding disease mechanisms. This approach has revealed unexpected genetic contributors, offering new insights into the pathophysiology of kidney disorders. The integration of these findings into precision medicine strategies promises to enhance diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic interventions. By focusing on the genetic underpinnings of rare kidney disorders, this research underscores the potential for genomics to transform the management of CKD, paving the way for personalized treatment plans that address the unique genetic profiles of patients."}
