{"Abstract": "Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is an age-associated phenomenon characterized by the expansion of hematopoietic stem cells harboring somatic mutations. This condition has garnered significant attention due to its implications for human health, particularly in the context of aging and disease. CHIP is prevalent in the elderly population and has been linked to an increased risk of hematological malignancies and non-hematological conditions, such as coronary artery disease (CAD). The underlying mechanisms involve alterations in DNA methylation and other epigenetic modifications, which may influence clonal trajectories and contribute to disease pathogenesis. Recent studies have highlighted the role of CHIP in promoting inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, thereby exacerbating cardiovascular risk. Understanding the biological underpinnings of CHIP and its impact on health is crucial for developing targeted interventions. This review synthesizes current knowledge on CHIP, emphasizing its clinical significance and potential as a biomarker for disease risk stratification, while also exploring future research directions to mitigate its adverse health effects."}
