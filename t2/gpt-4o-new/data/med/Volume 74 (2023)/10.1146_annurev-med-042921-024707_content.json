{"Abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma, a malignancy of the bile duct, presents significant therapeutic challenges due to its molecular heterogeneity. Recent studies have identified fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) as a critical oncogenic driver in a subset of these tumors, characterized by mutations, fusions, amplifications, and in-frame deletions. Targeted inhibition of FGFR2 has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy, yet resistance mechanisms remain a significant hurdle. This review explores the landscape of FGFR2 alterations in cholangiocarcinoma and the impact of these genetic changes on treatment outcomes. We discuss the role of downstream signaling pathways, including RAS, EGFR, and MEK, in mediating resistance to FGFR2 inhibitors. Understanding these pathways is crucial for developing combination therapies that can overcome resistance and improve patient outcomes. Additionally, we highlight ongoing clinical trials and emerging strategies aimed at enhancing the efficacy of FGFR2-targeted therapies. By elucidating the molecular underpinnings of FGFR2-driven cholangiocarcinoma, this research aims to inform the development of more effective, personalized treatment approaches for this challenging cancer type."}
