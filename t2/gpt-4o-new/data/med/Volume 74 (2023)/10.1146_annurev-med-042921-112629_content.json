{"Abstract": "The advent of polygenic scores (PGS) has revolutionized the field of genomics, offering novel insights into the genetic underpinnings of complex diseases such as coronary artery disease (CAD). This review explores recent advances in the development and application of PGS for CAD, highlighting their potential in enhancing risk prediction and informing prevention strategies. By aggregating the effects of numerous genetic variants, PGS provide a quantifiable measure of an individual's genetic predisposition to CAD, surpassing traditional risk factors in predictive accuracy. Recent studies demonstrate the utility of PGS in stratifying individuals into different risk categories, thereby facilitating personalized interventions and lifestyle modifications. Furthermore, the integration of PGS with clinical and environmental data holds promise for refining risk assessment models. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, including the need for diverse population studies and the ethical considerations surrounding genetic data usage. This review underscores the transformative potential of PGS in CAD management and calls for continued research to optimize their clinical application and accessibility."}
