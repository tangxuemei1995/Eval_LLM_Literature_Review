{"Abstract": "This study examines the implications of incorporating race in kidney function estimation, highlighting the potential for perpetuating health disparities. By analyzing the historical context and current practices of race-based clinical algorithms, we identify inherent biases that may affect patient care and outcomes. The research underscores the need for equitable healthcare practices, advocating for the removal of race as a factor in kidney function estimation. We propose alternative approaches that prioritize individual patient characteristics over racial categorizations, aiming to advance health justice. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discourse on equity in medicine, emphasizing the importance of unbiased clinical decision-making."}
