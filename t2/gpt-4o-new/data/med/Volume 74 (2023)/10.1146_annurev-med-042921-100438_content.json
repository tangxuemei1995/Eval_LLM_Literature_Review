{"Abstract": "Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a prevalent cause of secondary hypertension, characterized by excessive aldosterone production, leading to cardiovascular and renal complications. This review explores the pathophysiological mechanisms by which aldosterone contributes to hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) have emerged as a pivotal therapeutic strategy in managing PA, offering significant benefits for heart and kidney health. By blocking aldosterone's effects, MRAs mitigate hypertension and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and renal deterioration. Recent studies highlight the efficacy of MRAs in improving clinical outcomes, emphasizing their role in personalized treatment plans for PA patients. This paper underscores the importance of early diagnosis and intervention with MRAs to prevent long-term organ damage, advocating for their integration into standard care protocols for individuals with PA."}
