{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has highlighted the intricate interplay between viral infections and the endocrine system. This review explores the impact of COVID-19 on various endocrine disorders, including obesity, thyroid dysfunction, adrenal insufficiency, pituitary abnormalities, and reproductive health. Obesity, a significant risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes, is examined in the context of metabolic and inflammatory pathways. Thyroid and adrenal glands are susceptible to viral-induced dysfunction, potentially exacerbating pre-existing conditions. Pituitary involvement, though less common, can lead to critical hormonal imbalances. Furthermore, the virus's impact on reproductive health raises concerns about fertility and long-term consequences. Understanding these interactions is crucial for managing patients with endocrine disorders during the pandemic, guiding therapeutic strategies, and informing future research directions. This synthesis underscores the need for interdisciplinary approaches to address the multifaceted challenges posed by COVID-19 in endocrine health."}
