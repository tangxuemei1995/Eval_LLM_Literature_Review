{"Abstract": "Cytokine Storm Syndrome (CSS) is a hyperinflammatory condition characterized by excessive cytokine release, leading to severe systemic inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction. This syndrome encompasses a spectrum of disorders, including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), and cytokine release syndrome (CRS). The pathophysiology of CSS involves dysregulated immune responses, where cytolysis and hyperactivation of macrophages and lymphocytes play pivotal roles. These processes result in the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma, which contribute to the clinical manifestations of fever, cytopenias, and organomegaly. Recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying CSS have highlighted the importance of genetic predispositions and environmental triggers in its pathogenesis. Therapeutic strategies targeting cytokine signaling pathways, such as the use of cytokine inhibitors and immunosuppressive agents, have shown promise in managing CSS. Further research is essential to elucidate the complex interactions within the immune system and to develop more effective treatments for this life-threatening condition."}
