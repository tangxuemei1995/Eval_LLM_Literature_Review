{"Abstract": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains a significant challenge in transplant recipients, often leading to severe complications. Letermovir, a novel antiviral agent, has emerged as a promising option for CMV prophylaxis and treatment, particularly in the context of solid organ and hematopoietic cell transplants. This review examines the efficacy and safety profile of letermovir, highlighting its unique mechanism of action as a CMV terminase complex inhibitor. Clinical trials have demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing CMV infection rates and associated morbidity in transplant patients, with a favorable safety profile compared to traditional antivirals. Letermovir's role in prophylaxis is well-established, offering a significant reduction in CMV reactivation and disease. However, its application in active CMV treatment requires further investigation. The review also discusses potential resistance issues and the integration of letermovir into existing CMV management protocols. Overall, letermovir represents a significant advancement in CMV management, improving outcomes for transplant recipients."}
