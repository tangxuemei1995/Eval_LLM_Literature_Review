{"Abstract": "Maternal mortality in the United States remains a critical public health issue, with significant disparities across racial, socioeconomic, and geographic lines. This study examines recent trends in maternal mortality rates, identifying key factors contributing to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Emphasis is placed on the role of preconception health and counseling as pivotal strategies for prevention. By analyzing data from national health databases and reviewing current literature, the research highlights the importance of addressing underlying health conditions and improving access to quality healthcare before conception. The findings suggest that targeted interventions, including comprehensive preconception care and education, can significantly reduce maternal mortality rates. This study underscores the need for policy changes and resource allocation to support these preventive measures, ultimately improving maternal health outcomes nationwide."}
