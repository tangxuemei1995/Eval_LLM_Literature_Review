{"Abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder characterized by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, leading to dysfunctional ion transport and viscous secretions. Recent advancements in CFTR modulator therapies have revolutionized CF management by targeting the underlying protein defect. These modulators, including potentiators, correctors, and amplifiers, enhance CFTR function, improving pulmonary outcomes and quality of life. This review explores the mechanisms, efficacy, and limitations of current CFTR modulators, highlighting their impact on disease progression and future therapeutic directions. Continued research is essential to optimize treatment strategies and address unmet needs in CF care."}
