{"Abstract": "This study explores current concepts in gender-affirming care for transgender and gender-diverse youth, focusing on the use of pubertal blockers and gender-affirming hormone treatments. Pubertal blockers, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, are critical in delaying puberty, allowing time for youth to explore their gender identity without the added stress of unwanted physical changes. Gender-affirming hormone treatments further support the alignment of physical characteristics with gender identity. The research highlights the importance of individualized care plans and the role of healthcare providers in supporting the mental and physical well-being of transgender and gender-diverse youth."}
