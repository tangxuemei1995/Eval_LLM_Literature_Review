{"Abstract": "Chronic neuromuscular respiratory failure is a debilitating condition characterized by the progressive weakening of respiratory muscles, leading to insufficient ventilation and gas exchange. Home assisted ventilation, particularly noninvasive ventilation (NIV), has emerged as a pivotal intervention in managing this condition. This approach offers significant benefits, including improved quality of life, reduced hospitalizations, and enhanced survival rates. Recent advancements in ventilatory technology and patient monitoring have further optimized the efficacy of home-based care. This review explores the pathophysiology of chronic neuromuscular respiratory failure, the role of NIV in home settings, and the latest innovations in ventilatory support. Emphasis is placed on patient selection, adherence, and the impact of personalized care strategies on clinical outcomes."}
