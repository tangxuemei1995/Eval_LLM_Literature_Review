{"Abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin, leading to severe clinical complications. Recent advancements in gene therapy offer promising avenues for curative treatments. This review explores diverse approaches, including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which remains the only established cure but is limited by donor availability and risks. Gene therapy strategies, such as lentiviral vector-mediated gene addition, aim to introduce functional hemoglobin genes into patient-derived stem cells. Additionally, gene editing technologies like CRISPR/Cas9 offer precise correction of the sickle mutation or reactivation of fetal hemoglobin production. These innovative approaches are in various stages of clinical development, showing potential to transform SCD management. Challenges remain in optimizing delivery, ensuring safety, and achieving widespread clinical application, necessitating continued research and collaboration."}
