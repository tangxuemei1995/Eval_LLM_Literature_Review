{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a significant increase in thrombotic complications, posing a challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. This study explores the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying COVID-19-associated thrombosis, emphasizing the role of endothelial dysfunction, hypercoagulability, and platelet activation. The review synthesizes current evidence on the efficacy and safety of anticoagulants and platelet aggregation inhibitors in managing these complications. Anticoagulants, such as heparin and direct oral anticoagulants, have shown promise in reducing thrombotic events, while platelet aggregation inhibitors like aspirin may offer additional benefits in specific patient populations. However, the optimal therapeutic strategy remains uncertain, necessitating further clinical trials to refine treatment protocols. This paper highlights the importance of individualized patient assessment and the potential for combination therapies to mitigate the risk of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients. Understanding these therapeutic strategies is crucial for improving patient outcomes and guiding future research in this evolving field."}
