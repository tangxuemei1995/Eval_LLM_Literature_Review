{"Abstract": "The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies, particularly exome and genome sequencing, has revolutionized the diagnostic approach to undiagnosed syndromes, especially those suspected to be of genetic origin. This study explores the efficacy of exome and genome sequencing in identifying causative genetic variants in patients with rare and ultrarare diseases, often characterized by Mendelian inheritance patterns. By analyzing a cohort of individuals with previously undiagnosed conditions, we demonstrate that exome sequencing can effectively pinpoint pathogenic variants in coding regions, while genome sequencing offers a more comprehensive analysis, including non-coding regions and structural variants. Our findings underscore the importance of these technologies in clinical diagnostics, providing a molecular diagnosis in a significant proportion of cases that were previously elusive. Furthermore, the study highlights the potential of genome sequencing to uncover novel genetic mechanisms underlying rare diseases, thereby expanding our understanding of human genetics and facilitating the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. This research supports the integration of sequencing technologies into routine clinical practice for undiagnosed syndromes."}
