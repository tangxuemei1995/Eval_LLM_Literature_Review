{"Abstract": "Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have emerged as a transformative class of medications with significant renal benefits beyond glycemic control. This review explores the impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney outcomes in both diabetic and nondiabetic populations. Recent studies demonstrate their efficacy in slowing the progression of diabetic kidney disease, reducing albuminuria, and preserving renal function. Furthermore, evidence suggests potential benefits in nondiabetic kidney disease, highlighting their role in a broader spectrum of renal pathologies. Additionally, SGLT2 inhibitors have shown a protective effect against acute kidney injury, offering a novel therapeutic avenue. These findings underscore the importance of SGLT2 inhibitors in nephrology, marking a paradigm shift in the management of kidney diseases and emphasizing their role in improving long-term renal outcomes."}
