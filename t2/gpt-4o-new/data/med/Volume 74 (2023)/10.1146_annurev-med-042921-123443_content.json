{"Abstract": "Club cell secretory protein (CCSP), also known as CC10, uteroglobin, or secretoglobin 1A1 (SCGB1A1), is a pivotal component in lung biology, with emerging roles in the pathophysiology of various lung diseases. This review synthesizes recent advances in understanding CCSP's function as a biomarker and its therapeutic potential. CCSP is primarily secreted by club cells in the bronchiolar epithelium and is involved in modulating inflammation, immune responses, and tissue repair. Altered levels of CCSP have been associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and lung cancer, highlighting its diagnostic and prognostic value. Furthermore, therapeutic strategies targeting CCSP pathways are being explored, offering promising avenues for intervention. This paper discusses the molecular mechanisms underlying CCSP's protective effects and evaluates its potential as a therapeutic target in lung disease management."}
