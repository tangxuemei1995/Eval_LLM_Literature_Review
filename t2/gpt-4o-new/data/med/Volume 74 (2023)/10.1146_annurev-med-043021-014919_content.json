{"Abstract": "This study explores innovative obesity treatments focusing on GLP-1 receptor agonists and emerging nutrient-stimulated hormone-based (NuSH) therapies. Recent advancements in dual and triple receptor agonists offer promising antiobesity effects by enhancing metabolic regulation and appetite suppression. NuSH-based therapies represent a novel approach, leveraging endogenous hormone pathways to optimize energy balance and weight management. This review synthesizes current research on these therapeutic strategies, highlighting their potential to revolutionize obesity treatment paradigms. Future directions include clinical trials to assess efficacy, safety, and long-term outcomes, aiming to address the global obesity epidemic with more effective interventions."}
