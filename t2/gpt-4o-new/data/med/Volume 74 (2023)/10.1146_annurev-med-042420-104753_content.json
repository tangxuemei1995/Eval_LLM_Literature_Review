{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has significantly impacted individuals with kidney disease, particularly those with chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), and those undergoing dialysis or kidney transplantation. This review examines the intersection of COVID-19 and kidney disease, highlighting the increased vulnerability of these patients to severe outcomes. Patients with kidney failure requiring replacement therapy (KFRT) face heightened risks due to their immunocompromised status and frequent healthcare interactions. The pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 suggests direct and indirect mechanisms of kidney injury, exacerbating pre-existing conditions. Furthermore, the pandemic has disrupted routine care and access to transplantation services, complicating management strategies. Understanding the implications of COVID-19 on kidney health is crucial for developing targeted interventions and optimizing care for this high-risk population. This study underscores the need for continued research and tailored healthcare policies to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on kidney disease patients."}
