{"Abstract": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy has emerged as a promising treatment for hemophilia, a genetic disorder characterized by deficiencies in clotting factors VIII (hemophilia A) and IX (hemophilia B). This therapy involves the delivery of functional copies of the deficient genes using AAV vectors, aiming to restore normal clotting factor levels. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated significant improvements in bleeding control and reduced need for factor replacement therapy. AAV gene therapy offers a potential long-term solution, with ongoing research focusing on optimizing vector design, enhancing transgene expression, and addressing immune responses. This innovative approach holds the potential to transform the management of hemophilia, improving patient outcomes and quality of life."}
