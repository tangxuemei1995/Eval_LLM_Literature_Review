{"Abstract": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) presents significant challenges in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These variants exhibit mutations that may enhance transmissibility, alter disease severity, and impact vaccine efficacy. This study reviews the molecular characteristics of key VOCs, including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron, and their implications for public health strategies. Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of these variants is crucial for developing effective interventions and updating vaccination protocols. The research underscores the need for continuous genomic surveillance and international collaboration to mitigate the impact of these evolving viral threats."}
