{"Abstract": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has been pivotal in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. However, rare cases of vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) have raised concerns. This study reviews the pathophysiology, incidence, and clinical management of VITT, characterized by thrombosis and low platelet counts following vaccination. The condition is hypothesized to be an immune-mediated response, similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, involving platelet factor 4 antibodies. Epidemiological data suggest a low incidence, predominantly associated with adenoviral vector vaccines. Clinical manifestations include cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and splanchnic vein thrombosis, often occurring within weeks post-vaccination. Early recognition and treatment with non-heparin anticoagulants and intravenous immunoglobulin are crucial for favorable outcomes. Despite its rarity, understanding VITT is essential for healthcare providers to balance the benefits of vaccination against potential risks, ensuring informed decision-making and patient safety."}
