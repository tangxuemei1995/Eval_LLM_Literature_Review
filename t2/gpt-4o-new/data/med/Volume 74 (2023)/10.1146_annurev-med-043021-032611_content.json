{"Abstract": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by diverse clinical manifestations and significant morbidity. Recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis of SLE have highlighted the pivotal role of type I interferons in disease progression. This has led to the development of novel diagnostic biomarkers and targeted biologic therapies aimed at modulating the interferon pathway. Emerging biologics, such as monoclonal antibodies targeting specific cytokines, offer promising therapeutic options with improved efficacy and safety profiles. This review synthesizes current research on interferon-targeted diagnostics and biologic therapies, emphasizing their potential to transform SLE management. Future directions include personalized medicine approaches to optimize treatment outcomes and reduce disease burden."}
