{"Abstract": "This study investigates the origins of racial and ethnic bias in pulmonary technologies, focusing on pulse oximetry and pulmonary function testing. Disparities in these medical devices and algorithms often stem from structural racism embedded in their design and implementation. Historical exclusion of diverse populations in clinical trials and data collection has led to inaccuracies in readings for non-white individuals, exacerbating health inequities. By analyzing the development processes and underlying assumptions of these technologies, this research highlights the need for inclusive practices and equitable standards. Addressing these biases is crucial for improving diagnostic accuracy and health outcomes across diverse racial and ethnic groups, ultimately fostering a more just healthcare system."}
