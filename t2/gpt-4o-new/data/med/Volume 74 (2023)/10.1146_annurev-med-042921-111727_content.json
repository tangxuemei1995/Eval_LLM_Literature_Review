{"Abstract": "Myocardial Infarction with Nonobstructive Coronary Arteries (MINOCA) represents a distinct clinical entity characterized by myocardial infarction symptoms without significant coronary artery obstruction. This condition challenges traditional paradigms of myocardial infarction, necessitating a nuanced understanding of its pathophysiology. Potential mechanisms include coronary spasm, microvascular dysfunction, and myocardial injury, with takotsubo syndrome also contributing to its etiology. Despite the absence of obstructive coronary disease, patients with MINOCA exhibit similar adverse outcomes to those with typical myocardial infarction, underscoring the importance of accurate diagnosis and management. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, and underlying mechanisms of MINOCA, highlighting the need for tailored therapeutic strategies. Future research should focus on elucidating the precise pathophysiological pathways and developing targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes. Understanding MINOCA is crucial for advancing cardiovascular care and optimizing treatment for this unique patient population."}
