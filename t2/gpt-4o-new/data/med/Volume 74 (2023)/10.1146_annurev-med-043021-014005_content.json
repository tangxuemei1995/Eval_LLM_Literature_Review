{"Abstract": "Sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are complex, heterogeneous conditions that pose significant challenges in critical care. Recent advances in biological phenotyping have enabled the identification of distinct phenotypes and subphenotypes within these conditions, offering potential pathways for precision medicine. This review synthesizes current research on the biological markers and clinical characteristics that define these phenotypes, highlighting their implications for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment strategies. By integrating multi-omics data and machine learning approaches, researchers aim to tailor therapeutic interventions to individual patient profiles, thereby improving outcomes. The study underscores the necessity for continued exploration of phenotypic variability in sepsis and ARDS to enhance the precision of critical care management and to facilitate the development of targeted therapies."}
