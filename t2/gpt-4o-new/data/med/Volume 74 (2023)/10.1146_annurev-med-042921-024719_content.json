{"Abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of lymphomas, yet its efficacy is often compromised by tumor antigen loss, leading to disease relapse. This study explores the potential of multispecific CAR T cells, including bispecific and trispecific constructs, to overcome this challenge. By targeting multiple antigens simultaneously, these engineered T cells aim to prevent tumor escape mechanisms associated with single antigen targeting. Our research demonstrates that multispecific CAR T cells exhibit enhanced cytotoxicity against lymphoma cells, maintaining efficacy even when one or more target antigens are downregulated. In vitro and in vivo models confirm that these CAR T cells can adapt to antigenic shifts, reducing the likelihood of tumor evasion. These findings suggest that multispecific CAR T cell therapy could offer a robust and durable treatment option for lymphoma patients, addressing a critical limitation of current CAR T cell strategies and paving the way for improved clinical outcomes."}
