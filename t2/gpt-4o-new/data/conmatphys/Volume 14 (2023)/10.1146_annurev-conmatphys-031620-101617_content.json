{"Abstract": "Quantum many-body scars represent a fascinating deviation from the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, offering a unique window into non-ergodic behavior in quantum systems. This study explores the phenomenon from a quasiparticle perspective, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms that enable certain eigenstates to evade thermalization. By examining the role of constrained dynamics and their impact on out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics, we identify key factors that contribute to the emergence of scars. Our analysis reveals how specific quasiparticle excitations can lead to long-lived coherent states, challenging conventional views of quantum chaos. This work not only advances the theoretical understanding of quantum many-body scars but also suggests potential experimental realizations in ultracold atomic systems, paving the way for future investigations into controlled quantum dynamics and their applications in quantum information processing."}
