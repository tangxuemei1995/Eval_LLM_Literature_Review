{"Abstract": "The study of superconductivity in systems with local inversion-symmetry breaking has unveiled novel phenomena, particularly in the context of topological and unconventional superconductors. This research explores the interplay between Rashba spin-orbit coupling and hidden spin polarization, which emerges in non-centrosymmetric environments. Such conditions can lead to the realization of exotic superconducting states with potential applications in quantum computing. By employing advanced theoretical models and experimental techniques, we investigate the role of local inversion-symmetry breaking in stabilizing topological superconductivity. Our findings suggest that the manipulation of Rashba spin-orbit coupling can induce unconventional pairing mechanisms, offering new pathways for engineering superconducting materials with tailored properties. This work not only enhances the understanding of fundamental superconducting phenomena but also paves the way for the development of next-generation quantum devices. The implications of these results are significant for both theoretical advancements and practical applications in the field of condensed matter physics."}
