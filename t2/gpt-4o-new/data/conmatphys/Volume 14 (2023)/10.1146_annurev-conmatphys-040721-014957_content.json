{"Abstract": "The Spin Seebeck Effect (SSE) has emerged as a pivotal phenomenon in the field of spin(calori)tronics, offering a sensitive probe for exploring various fundamental properties in solid-state systems. This effect, which involves the generation of a spin current in response to a thermal gradient, provides insights into elementary excitations such as magnons and nuclear spins. It also facilitates the study of spin correlations and transport mechanisms, particularly in antiferromagnetic spintronics. The SSE is instrumental in investigating magnetic order and domain structures, contributing to the understanding of complex phases like quantum spin liquids. Additionally, the inverse spin Hall effect, which converts spin currents into charge currents, is crucial for detecting and analyzing the SSE. This research underscores the SSE's potential in advancing the development of novel spintronic devices and enhancing our comprehension of magnetic phenomena in solids."}
