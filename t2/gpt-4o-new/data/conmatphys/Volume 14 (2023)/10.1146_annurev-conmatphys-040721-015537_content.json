{"Abstract": "Floquet states, arising in periodically driven quantum systems, offer a unique framework for exploring nonequilibrium statistical physics. This study investigates the behavior of Floquet states within open quantum systems, where interactions with an external environment introduce dissipation and decoherence. By employing advanced mathematical techniques and numerical simulations, we analyze the stability and dynamics of these states under various driving conditions. Our findings reveal that the interplay between periodic driving and environmental interactions can lead to novel steady-state behaviors and phase transitions, distinct from those in closed systems. These insights enhance our understanding of nonequilibrium phenomena and could inform the design of quantum technologies that exploit Floquet engineering. The results underscore the potential of Floquet systems as a versatile platform for exploring complex quantum dynamics in open environments."}
