{"Abstract": "The study of topological metals, particularly Dirac and Weyl semimetals, has emerged as a frontier in condensed matter physics due to their unique electronic properties and potential applications in quantum technologies. This research focuses on the fermiology of these materials, emphasizing the intricate relationship between their Fermi surfaces and topological characteristics. By employing advanced techniques such as quantum oscillations and magnetic breakdown, we explore the geometry and topology of Fermi surfaces in topological metals. Quantum oscillations, including Shubnikov-de Haas and de Haas-van Alphen effects, provide insights into the Berry phase, a critical parameter that distinguishes topological metals from conventional ones. The presence of nontrivial Berry phases is indicative of the topological nature of the electronic states, which can lead to novel phenomena such as chiral anomaly and anomalous Hall effects. Furthermore, the study delves into the role of magnetic breakdown in modifying the Fermi surface topology, offering a deeper understanding of the interplay between electronic structure and external magnetic fields. Our findings reveal that the Fermi surface topology in Dirac-Weyl semimetals is highly sensitive to external perturbations, which can be harnessed to control their electronic properties. This research not only advances the fundamental understanding of topological metals but also paves the way for designing materials with tailored electronic characteristics for future technological applications. The insights gained from this study are expected to stimulate further experimental and theoretical investigations in the field of topological quantum materials."}
