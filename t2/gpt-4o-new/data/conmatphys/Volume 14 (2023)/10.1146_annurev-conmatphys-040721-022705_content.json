{"Abstract": "Tensor network algorithms have emerged as a powerful framework for tackling complex problems in computational physics, particularly in the study of quantum many-body systems. These algorithms leverage the concept of entanglement to efficiently represent and simulate quantum states, offering significant advantages over traditional numerical methods. This review provides a comprehensive route map of tensor network techniques, highlighting their applications in quantum information and their role in advancing our understanding of entangled systems. By exploring various tensor network structures and their computational implementations, we aim to elucidate the potential of these algorithms in addressing challenges in numerical simulations. The insights gained from this exploration underscore the transformative impact of tensor networks on the study of quantum phenomena and their broader implications in physics."}
