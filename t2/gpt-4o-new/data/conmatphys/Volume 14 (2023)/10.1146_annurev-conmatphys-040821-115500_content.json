{"Abstract": "This study delves into the modeling of active colloids, focusing on the transition from active Brownian particles to the incorporation of hydrodynamic and chemical fields. By employing advanced numerical modeling techniques, we explore the intricate dynamics of microswimmers in complex environments. The research highlights the significance of hydrodynamic and phoretic interactions, which are pivotal in understanding the behavior of active colloids in active baths and their potential as active engines. Our findings provide insights into the emergent collective behaviors and the role of environmental factors in modulating these interactions. This work not only advances the theoretical framework for active matter but also paves the way for practical applications in designing synthetic microswimmers and optimizing their performance in diverse settings, from biomedical applications to environmental sensing."}
