{"Abstract": "This study explores the concept of learning without neurons in physical systems, challenging traditional paradigms of learning theory. By leveraging principles of inverse design, we investigate how metamaterials and self-assembling structures can exhibit learning behaviors akin to those found in biological systems. Our approach integrates machine learning techniques with physical systems, enabling the design of materials that can adapt and optimize their properties in response to environmental stimuli. We demonstrate that molecular computing can facilitate complex information processing tasks, traditionally associated with neural networks, within these non-biological substrates. The findings suggest that physical learning systems can achieve efficient computation and adaptation without the need for conventional neural architectures. This research opens new avenues for the development of smart materials and devices, with potential applications in areas such as adaptive optics, responsive surfaces, and autonomous systems. Our work lays the groundwork for future exploration into the capabilities and limitations of learning in physical systems."}
