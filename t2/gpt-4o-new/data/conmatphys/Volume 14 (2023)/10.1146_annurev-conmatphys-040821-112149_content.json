{"Abstract": "The study of swimming in complex fluids encompasses the intricate dynamics of locomotion within soft and active matter environments, such as biological fluids and active suspensions. This research explores the interplay between fluid mechanics and the propulsion mechanisms of microorganisms and synthetic swimmers. By examining the rheological properties of these non-Newtonian fluids, we aim to understand how viscosity, elasticity, and microstructural interactions influence swimming efficiency and behavior. The findings have significant implications for biological processes, such as sperm motility and pathogen transport, as well as for the design of bio-inspired robotic systems. This work advances our comprehension of active matter systems, contributing to the broader field of soft matter physics."}
