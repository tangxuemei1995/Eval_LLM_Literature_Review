{"Abstract": "This study explores the intriguing phenomena of odd viscosity and odd elasticity within the framework of continuum mechanics, focusing on their implications in fluid mechanics and active matter systems. Odd viscosity and elasticity, characterized by their non-dissipative nature, arise in systems far from equilibrium, such as chiral active fluids. We investigate the hydrodynamic and rheological behaviors of these systems, highlighting the unique transport properties and stress responses that deviate from conventional expectations. By employing theoretical models and simulations, we elucidate the role of odd viscosity and elasticity in shaping the dynamics of active matter, offering insights into novel material design and applications. This work advances our understanding of nonequilibrium systems, paving the way for future explorations in complex fluid dynamics."}
