{"Abstract": "Non-Hermitian topological phenomena have emerged as a vibrant field of study, bridging the gap between non-Hermitian physics and topological phases. This review explores the unique properties and theoretical frameworks that arise when non-Hermitian systems are considered, particularly focusing on the modified bulk-boundary correspondence and its implications for spectral theory. By examining recent advancements, we highlight how non-Hermitian systems exhibit novel topological phases that are absent in Hermitian counterparts, driven by complex energy spectra and exceptional points. The review also discusses experimental realizations and potential applications in photonics and condensed matter systems. Through a comprehensive analysis, this work aims to provide a deeper understanding of the interplay between non-Hermiticity and topology, paving the way for future research in this rapidly evolving domain."}
