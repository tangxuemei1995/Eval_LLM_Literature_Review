{"Abstract": "The study of human crowd dynamics, an intersection of active matter and social physics, reveals complex emergent phenomena through observational experiments. By analyzing pedestrian flows, researchers uncover patterns and behaviors that inform models of crowd movement and interaction. This research enhances our understanding of collective human behavior, offering insights into safety, urban planning, and event management, while contributing to the broader field of active matter physics."}
