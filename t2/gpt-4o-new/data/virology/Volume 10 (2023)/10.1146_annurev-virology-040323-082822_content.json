{"Abstract": "The intricate interplay between the microbiome, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and bile acids is increasingly recognized as a pivotal factor in regulating immune homeostasis and inflammation, with significant implications for HIV persistence. This review explores the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota and its metabolites influence immune function and contribute to the chronic immune activation observed in HIV-infected individuals. SCFAs, primarily produced through microbial fermentation of dietary fibers, have been shown to modulate immune responses by acting on various immune cells, thereby potentially mitigating inflammation and promoting immune tolerance. Concurrently, bile acids, which are modified by gut bacteria, serve as signaling molecules that can influence host metabolism and immune regulation. Dysbiosis, or the imbalance of microbial communities, is frequently observed in HIV patients and is associated with increased inflammation and immune dysfunction, which may contribute to viral persistence despite antiretroviral therapy. Understanding the role of the microbiome and its metabolites in HIV pathogenesis could unveil novel therapeutic targets aimed at restoring immune balance and reducing viral reservoirs. This review underscores the need for further research to elucidate the complex interactions between the microbiome, SCFAs, bile acids, and the immune system in the context of HIV infection."}
