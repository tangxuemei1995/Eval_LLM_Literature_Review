{"Abstract": "Microviruses, a family of single-stranded DNA phages, have long been exemplified by the well-studied phiX174. However, recent advances in metagenomics and virome analysis have unveiled a diverse and complex world of Microviridae beyond this model organism. This study explores the taxonomy and evolutionary dynamics of microviruses, highlighting their ecological roles and genetic diversity. By analyzing metagenomic datasets, we identify novel microvirus lineages and assess their distribution across various environments. Our findings suggest that microviruses play significant roles in microbial community dynamics and horizontal gene transfer. The evolutionary insights gained from this research challenge traditional views of virus taxonomy and underscore the importance of integrating metagenomic approaches in virology. This expanded understanding of microviruses not only enriches our knowledge of viral biodiversity but also provides a framework for future studies on virus-host interactions and ecosystem functioning."}
