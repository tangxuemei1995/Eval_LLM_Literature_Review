{"Abstract": "Viral evolution is intricately influenced by host proteostasis networks, which encompass protein folding biophysics, stress response mechanisms, and chaperone-mediated quality control systems. This study explores how these host cellular processes drive viral adaptation, enabling viruses to optimize their replication and survival strategies. By leveraging host chaperones and folding pathways, viruses can enhance their protein stability and functionality, thereby increasing their fitness. Additionally, the host's stress response and quality control mechanisms can inadvertently facilitate viral evolution by selecting for variants that resist degradation or misfolding. This dynamic interplay not only contributes to the emergence of drug and immune system resistance but also highlights potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Understanding the molecular interactions between viral components and host proteostasis networks offers insights into the evolutionary pressures shaping viral genomes and provides a framework for developing strategies to mitigate viral pathogenicity and resistance. This research underscores the importance of host-pathogen interactions in viral evolution."}
