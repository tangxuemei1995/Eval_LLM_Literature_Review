{"Abstract": "The study of nucleotide second messenger systems has unveiled critical insights into the mechanisms of innate immune signaling, particularly in antiviral defense. This review explores the evolutionary origins and functional mechanisms of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, alongside the cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signaling system (CBASS). Both systems utilize nucleotide second messengers to detect and respond to pathogenic threats, highlighting a conserved strategy across diverse biological domains. cGAS-STING is pivotal in mammalian antiviral immunity, detecting cytosolic DNA and triggering type I interferon responses. Conversely, CBASS, primarily found in bacteria, employs cyclic oligonucleotides to activate defense responses against phage infections. Recent discoveries of cGLR (cyclic GMP-AMP-like receptor) proteins suggest a potential evolutionary link between these systems, offering insights into the diversification of immune signaling pathways. Understanding these mechanisms not only elucidates fundamental aspects of immune biology but also opens avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting dysregulated immune responses in diseases such as autoimmunity and cancer."}
