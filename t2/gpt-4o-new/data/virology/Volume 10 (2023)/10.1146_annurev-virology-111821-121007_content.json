{"Abstract": "O-linked glycans, particularly those associated with mucin-like domains, play a critical role in the structure and function of viral envelope proteins. These glycans contribute to the viral life cycle by facilitating attachment, entry, and egress of virions. The interaction of O-linked glycans with host cell surface molecules, such as heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, is crucial for viral attachment and subsequent infection. This review explores the structural diversity of O-linked glycans in viral envelope proteins and their implications for viral pathogenesis. Understanding these interactions provides insights into the development of novel antiviral strategies, including vaccines. By targeting the glycan-mediated processes, it may be possible to inhibit viral attachment and egress, thereby reducing viral spread. The study of O-linked glycans in viral proteins not only enhances our understanding of viral biology but also opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions aimed at disrupting critical stages of the viral life cycle."}
