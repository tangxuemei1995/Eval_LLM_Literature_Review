{"Abstract": "Enteric viruses, including norovirus, play a significant role in modulating the immune response within the intestinal environment. These viruses, which are a crucial component of the human virome, interact intricately with the host's immune system, influencing both innate and adaptive immunity. This immunomodulation can lead to varied outcomes, from asymptomatic infections to severe gastroenteritis. The mechanisms by which enteric viruses modulate immune responses involve complex interactions with intestinal epithelial cells, dendritic cells, and gut-associated lymphoid tissues. Understanding these interactions is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies and vaccines. Recent studies have highlighted the dual role of enteric viruses in both promoting immune tolerance and triggering inflammatory responses, depending on the context of infection and host factors. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the immunomodulatory effects of enteric viruses, emphasizing the need for further research to unravel the complexities of virus-host interactions in the gut."}
