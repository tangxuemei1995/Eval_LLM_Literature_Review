{"Abstract": "Herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus and pseudorabies virus, undergo a complex nuclear egress process critical for viral replication and pathogenesis. This process involves the formation of the nuclear egress complex (NEC), which facilitates the budding of primary enveloped virions (PEVs) through the inner nuclear membrane. Despite significant advances in understanding the NEC's structural and functional dynamics, several aspects of nuclear membrane fusion and the subsequent release of PEVs into the cytoplasm remain elusive. Recent studies have elucidated the roles of viral and host proteins in NEC assembly and function, yet the precise mechanisms governing membrane curvature and scission are not fully understood. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular interactions and regulatory pathways involved in herpesvirus nuclear egress, highlighting the known components and identifying gaps in our understanding. Addressing these unknowns is crucial for developing targeted antiviral strategies that disrupt this essential stage of the herpesvirus life cycle, potentially leading to novel therapeutic interventions."}
