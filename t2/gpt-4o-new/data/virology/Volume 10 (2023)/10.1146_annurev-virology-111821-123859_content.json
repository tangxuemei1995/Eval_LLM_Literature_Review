{"Abstract": "The study of ancient viral genomes offers a unique window into the past, providing insights into the co-evolution of humans and viruses. This research explores the field of paleovirology, utilizing ancient DNA (aDNA) to reconstruct viral genomes from archaeological and paleontological samples. By analyzing these ancient viruses, we can trace historical epidemics and understand their impact on human populations. The integration of paleogenomics with historical data allows for a comprehensive view of how viral pathogens have shaped human history, influencing migration patterns, population dynamics, and genetic diversity. This study highlights the methodological advancements in aDNA extraction and sequencing, which have enabled the recovery of viral sequences from ancient remains. The findings underscore the importance of ancient viruses in understanding the evolutionary pressures faced by early human societies and provide a framework for predicting future viral threats. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the intricate relationship between humans and viruses throughout history."}
