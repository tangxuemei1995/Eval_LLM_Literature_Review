{"Abstract": "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a sophisticated translational control mechanism employed by various viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and HIV, to optimize the expression of their genomic information. This process involves a shift in the reading frame of the ribosome, typically induced by specific mRNA structures such as pseudoknots, which are strategically positioned downstream of the frameshift site. Recent structural studies have provided significant insights into the molecular interactions between the ribosome and these mRNA elements, revealing how they induce conformational changes that facilitate frameshifting. Advanced techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy have elucidated the dynamic nature of ribosomal engagement with pseudoknots, highlighting the critical role of ribosomal proteins and rRNA in stabilizing these interactions. Functionally, PRF allows viruses to regulate the stoichiometry of their protein products, which is crucial for their replication and pathogenicity. Understanding the structural and functional nuances of PRF not only enhances our comprehension of viral translation strategies but also opens avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting these processes. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the structural basis of PRF, with a focus on its implications for viral lifecycle management and potential antiviral strategies."}
