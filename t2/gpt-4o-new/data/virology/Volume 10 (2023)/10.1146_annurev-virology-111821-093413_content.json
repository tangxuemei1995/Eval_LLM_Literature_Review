{"Abstract": "Viral membrane fusion is a critical step in the viral life cycle, facilitating the entry of viral genomes into host cells. This process is orchestrated by viral fusion proteins, categorized into class I, II, and III, each with distinct structural and mechanistic features. These proteins undergo conformational changes, transitioning through intermediates to form trimers-of-hairpins, which drive membrane fusion. The energetics of fusion are influenced by the interplay between fusion peptides or loops and the lipid bilayer, modulating lipid dynamics to overcome energy barriers. Additionally, host cell fusion restriction factors can impede this process, offering potential therapeutic targets. Understanding the intricate dance between proteins and lipids during viral fusion provides insights into viral pathogenesis and informs the development of antiviral strategies."}
