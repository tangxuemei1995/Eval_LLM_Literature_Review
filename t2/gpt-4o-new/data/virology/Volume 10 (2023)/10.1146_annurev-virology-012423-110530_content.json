{"Abstract": "The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria poses a significant threat to global health, necessitating alternative therapeutic strategies. Phage therapy, which utilizes bacteriophages to target and destroy pathogenic bacteria, offers a promising solution. However, the evolution of phage-resistant bacteria remains a critical challenge. This study explores the development of phage therapy that can effectively counteract bacterial resistance through the exploitation of evolutionary trade-offs. By understanding the genetic and phenotypic changes that confer resistance, we aim to design phage cocktails that induce fitness costs in bacteria, thereby limiting their ability to evolve resistance. Our research employs a combination of experimental evolution, genomic analysis, and mathematical modeling to predict and manipulate bacterial evolutionary pathways. The findings suggest that strategically designed phage therapies can sustainably manage bacterial infections by leveraging evolutionary constraints, offering a viable alternative to traditional antibiotics in the fight against resistant pathogens."}
