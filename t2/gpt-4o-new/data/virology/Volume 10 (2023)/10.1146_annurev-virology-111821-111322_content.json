{"Abstract": "The interaction between mammalian cells and bacteriophages, traditionally considered exclusive to bacterial hosts, is gaining attention for its potential implications in cellular immunity and inflammation. This study explores the mechanisms by which mammalian cells process bacteriophages, focusing on endocytosis and intracellular trafficking pathways. We investigate how these pathways influence the cellular response to phage presence, potentially modulating immune responses and contributing to the virome's complexity. Our findings suggest that mammalian cells utilize endocytic pathways to internalize bacteriophages, followed by trafficking to various intracellular compartments. This process may trigger immune signaling cascades, influencing inflammation and cellular homeostasis. By elucidating these interactions, we provide insights into the broader implications of phage presence in mammalian systems, highlighting their role in shaping immune responses and maintaining virome equilibrium. This research underscores the need to further explore the impact of bacteriophages on mammalian cellular processes, with potential applications in therapeutic strategies targeting inflammation and immune modulation."}
