{"Abstract": "The viral protein U (Vpu) of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a small, multifunctional accessory protein that plays a critical role in viral pathogenesis and immune evasion. Vpu is known for its ability to downregulate CD4 and tetherin, thereby facilitating viral release and preventing superinfection. This protein's interaction with the host's immune system is complex, as it modulates the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for immune response regulation. By inhibiting NF-κB, Vpu contributes to immune evasion, allowing the virus to persist in the host. Recent studies have also highlighted Vpu's involvement in the DNA damage repair pathways, suggesting a broader impact on cellular processes beyond its traditional roles. The versatility of Vpu underscores its importance in the HIV life cycle and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of Vpu's interactions with host proteins could lead to novel strategies to combat HIV infection. This review synthesizes current knowledge on Vpu's functions and its implications for HIV pathogenesis, emphasizing the need for further research into its diverse roles."}
