{"Abstract": "Biomolecular condensates, dynamic cellular structures formed through liquid-liquid phase separation, play a pivotal role in viral replication and assembly. This study explores the intricate relationship between viruses and these condensates, focusing on viral factories and viroplasms as key sites for virus assembly. We examine segmented RNA genomes, particularly in rotaviruses, to understand how phase transitions facilitate the spatial organization and efficiency of viral replication. By analyzing the mechanisms of condensate formation and their functional implications, we provide insights into the strategies employed by viruses to hijack host cellular machinery. This research underscores the potential of targeting biomolecular condensates in antiviral strategies, offering a novel perspective on combating viral infections by disrupting the phase-separated environments essential for viral life cycles."}
