{"Abstract": "The intricate interplay between the microbiota and viral infections has garnered significant attention in recent years, revealing the profound impact of microbial communities on host immune responses. This review explores the multifaceted roles of the microbiota and its metabolites in modulating viral pathogenesis and host defense mechanisms. The microbiome, through its diverse metabolic outputs, influences the virome by altering viral replication and persistence. Key to this interaction is the modulation of interferon signaling pathways, which are crucial for antiviral defense. Microbial metabolites can enhance or suppress interferon responses, thereby affecting the outcome of viral infections. Understanding these complex interactions offers potential therapeutic avenues for modulating the microbiota to enhance antiviral immunity. This synthesis of current research underscores the necessity of integrating microbiome studies into virology to develop comprehensive strategies for managing viral diseases, highlighting the microbiota's pivotal role in shaping host-pathogen dynamics."}
