{"Abstract": "Segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses, including influenza viruses, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), present unique genetic systems that facilitate the study of viral replication and pathogenesis. These viruses possess segmented genomes, allowing for genetic reassortment and the development of novel strains. Recent advancements have enabled the creation of reporter strains, incorporating fluorescent and bioluminescent markers, which provide powerful tools for real-time visualization and quantification of viral infection in vitro and in vivo. These reporter strains have significantly enhanced our understanding of viral dynamics, host-pathogen interactions, and immune responses. Furthermore, they offer potential applications in antiviral drug screening and vaccine development. This review highlights the genetic manipulation techniques used to generate these reporter strains and discusses their experimental uses, emphasizing their contributions to virology research and therapeutic innovation."}
