{"Abstract": "The study of cross-kingdom interactions between plant and fungal viruses is an emerging field that explores the complex dynamics of virus transmission and interaction across different biological kingdoms. This research investigates the mechanisms by which plant and fungal viruses interact, focusing on the potential for cross-kingdom infection and the implications for virus transmission. Key areas of interest include the extracellular transfer of viral particles and the role of virus-virus interactions in facilitating or inhibiting cross-kingdom movement. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing innovative biocontrol strategies to manage viral diseases in plants and fungi. This study synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular and ecological aspects of these interactions, highlighting the potential for novel approaches to disease management. The findings underscore the importance of considering cross-kingdom viral dynamics in the broader context of ecosystem health and agricultural productivity."}
