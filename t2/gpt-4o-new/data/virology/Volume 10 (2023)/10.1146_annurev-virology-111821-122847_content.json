{"Abstract": "The dynamic interaction between tobamoviruses and plant immunity represents a critical area of study in plant pathology. This research explores the complex mechanisms by which plants recognize and respond to tobamovirus infections, focusing on pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) and the role of resistance genes. The study delves into the molecular strategies employed by plants, such as RNA silencing and the salicylic acid pathway, to counteract viral threats. Special attention is given to the Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) and Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), highlighting their ability to overcome plant defenses. By examining the perpetual arms race between these viruses and plant immune systems, the research aims to uncover novel insights into enhancing crop resistance. The findings underscore the importance of integrating genetic and biochemical approaches to develop sustainable strategies for managing tobamovirus outbreaks, ultimately contributing to global food security."}
