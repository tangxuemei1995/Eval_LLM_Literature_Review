{"Abstract": "Nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA viruses, classified under the order Mononegavirales, encompass significant human and animal pathogens, including paramyxoviruses, filoviruses, pneumoviruses, and rhabdoviruses. Central to their replication and transcription is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a multifunctional enzyme complex responsible for synthesizing viral RNA. This study delves into the structural and mechanistic intricacies of RdRp across various Mononegavirales families. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography have elucidated high-resolution structures, revealing conserved motifs and unique adaptations that facilitate viral RNA synthesis. These structural insights have unraveled the dynamic conformational changes and interactions with viral and host factors that underpin the polymerase's function. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for the development of antiviral strategies targeting RdRp. This review synthesizes current knowledge, highlighting the diversity and commonalities in RdRp architecture and function, and discusses potential therapeutic implications for controlling infections caused by these pervasive viruses."}
