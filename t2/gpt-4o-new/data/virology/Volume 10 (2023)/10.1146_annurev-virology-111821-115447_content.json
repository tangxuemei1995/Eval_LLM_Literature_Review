{"Abstract": "Influenza viruses pose significant public health challenges due to their high transmission rates, primarily through airborne respiratory droplets. This study explores various barriers to the transmission of influenza viruses, focusing on both biological and environmental factors. Vaccines and antivirals remain critical in reducing virus spread and severity, yet their effectiveness can be limited by viral mutations. Non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as masks and improved ventilation, are essential in mitigating airborne transmission. Additionally, ultraviolet (UV) light has shown promise in inactivating viruses in the environment. The role of mucus in trapping and neutralizing viruses is also examined, highlighting its potential as a natural barrier. Understanding these multifaceted approaches is crucial for developing comprehensive strategies to block the spread of influenza, thereby enhancing public health preparedness and response."}
