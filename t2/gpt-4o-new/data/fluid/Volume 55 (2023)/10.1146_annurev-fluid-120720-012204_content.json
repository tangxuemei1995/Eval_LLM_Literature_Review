{"Abstract": "The study of self-propulsion in chemically active droplets has garnered significant attention due to its implications for understanding microswimmers and designing synthetic active matter. This research investigates the mechanisms underlying the autonomous motion of active droplets, focusing on the interplay between Marangoni flows and advectionâ€“diffusion processes. By employing a combination of experimental observations and theoretical modeling, we explore how chemical reactions at the droplet interface induce symmetry-breaking, leading to sustained propulsion in viscous environments. Our findings reveal that the self-generated concentration gradients drive Marangoni flows, which in turn facilitate droplet movement through a delicate balance of forces. The results highlight the critical role of interfacial tension variations and fluid dynamics in governing the behavior of active droplets. This work not only advances our understanding of natural microswimmers but also provides insights into the design of novel synthetic systems capable of autonomous navigation in complex fluidic landscapes."}
