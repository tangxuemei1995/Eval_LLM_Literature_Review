{"Abstract": "This study explores the fluid dynamics of polar vortices on Earth, Mars, and Titan, focusing on their atmospheric circulation and vortex dynamics. By analyzing potential vorticity and Rossby wave interactions, we aim to understand the similarities and differences in vortex behavior across these celestial bodies. Earth's polar vortices are well-studied, providing a baseline for comparison with the less understood Martian and Titanian vortices. Mars exhibits a dynamic polar vortex influenced by its thin atmosphere and seasonal CO2 ice caps, while Titan's dense, nitrogen-rich atmosphere presents unique vortex characteristics. Through comparative planetology, this research highlights the role of atmospheric composition, rotation rate, and solar insolation in shaping vortex dynamics. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of atmospheric processes and may inform future planetary exploration and climate modeling efforts."}
