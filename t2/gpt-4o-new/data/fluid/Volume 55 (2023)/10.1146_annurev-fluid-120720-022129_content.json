{"Abstract": "Immersed boundary methods (IBMs) have emerged as a pivotal computational tool for simulating complex flows, particularly in scenarios involving fluid-structure interactions and multiphysics problems. This paper provides a comprehensive historical perspective on the development of IBMs, tracing their evolution from early conceptual frameworks to sophisticated algorithms capable of handling intricate boundary conditions and diverse physical phenomena. Initially developed to address the challenges posed by complex geometries in fluid dynamics, IBMs have significantly advanced, incorporating wall models and adaptive mesh refinement techniques to enhance accuracy and computational efficiency. The versatility of IBMs has facilitated their application across various scientific and engineering domains, including biomedical engineering, aerodynamics, and environmental science. As we look to the future, the integration of machine learning and high-performance computing is poised to further revolutionize IBMs, enabling real-time simulations and more accurate predictions of multiphysics interactions. This paper also discusses the current challenges and potential research directions, emphasizing the need for improved numerical stability and the development of robust algorithms to handle increasingly complex systems. Ultimately, IBMs continue to be a dynamic and evolving field, offering promising avenues for future exploration and innovation."}
