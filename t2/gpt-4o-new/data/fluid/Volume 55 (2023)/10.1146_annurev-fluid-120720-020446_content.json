{"Abstract": "Turbulent rotating Rayleigh–Bénard convection is a complex fluid dynamic phenomenon characterized by the interplay of buoyancy-driven flow and rotational effects. This study investigates the intricate dynamics of this system, focusing on the impact of rotation on heat transport and flow structures. Utilizing a combination of theoretical analysis, direct numerical simulations, and experimental measurements, we explore the parameter space defined by the Rayleigh and Rossby numbers. Our findings reveal that rotation significantly alters the heat transport efficiency and modifies the flow topology, leading to the formation of coherent structures such as vortices and plumes. The results demonstrate a non-monotonic dependence of the Nusselt number on the rotation rate, highlighting the competition between buoyancy and Coriolis forces. Theoretical models are developed to predict the observed trends, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms governing the flow. This research advances our understanding of geophysical and astrophysical flows, where similar conditions prevail, and contributes to the broader field of turbulent convection by elucidating the role of rotation in modulating convective heat transfer."}
