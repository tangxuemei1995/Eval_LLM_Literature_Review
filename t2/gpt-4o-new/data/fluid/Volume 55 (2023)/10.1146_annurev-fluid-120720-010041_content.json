{"Abstract": "The first half of the twentieth century marked a pivotal era for the development of fluid mechanics in France, driven by the burgeoning demands of aeronautics and industrial applications. This period witnessed significant advancements in theoretical and experimental approaches, influenced by the socio-political and technological transformations of the time. French researchers, building on the foundational work of earlier scientists, contributed to the understanding of fluid dynamics through innovative experiments and the formulation of new theories. The establishment of research institutions and collaborations with the aeronautics industry played a crucial role in fostering these developments. Key figures, such as Henri Bénard and Paul Painlevé, emerged as leaders in the field, advancing the study of turbulence and boundary layers, which were critical for the design of aircraft and other engineering applications. The interplay between academic research and practical engineering challenges led to a rich exchange of ideas, propelling fluid mechanics into a modern scientific discipline. This historical analysis highlights the contributions of French scientists to the global understanding of fluid mechanics and underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in scientific progress."}
