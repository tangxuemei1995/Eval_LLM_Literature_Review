{"Abstract": "Submesoscale dynamics in the upper ocean play a critical role in modulating oceanic processes, influencing both local and global climate systems. These dynamics, characterized by small-scale turbulence, eddies, and fronts, occur at spatial scales of 1-10 kilometers and temporal scales of hours to days. They significantly impact the vertical and horizontal transport of heat, nutrients, and carbon, thereby affecting biological productivity and biogeochemical cycles. Recent advances in observational techniques and high-resolution numerical models have enhanced our understanding of submesoscale processes, revealing their contribution to energy dissipation and mixing in the ocean. This research synthesizes current knowledge on submesoscale dynamics, emphasizing their interaction with larger-scale oceanic and atmospheric phenomena. Understanding these interactions is crucial for improving climate models and predicting future climate scenarios. The study highlights the need for continued exploration of submesoscale processes to better comprehend their implications for oceanic and climatic systems."}
