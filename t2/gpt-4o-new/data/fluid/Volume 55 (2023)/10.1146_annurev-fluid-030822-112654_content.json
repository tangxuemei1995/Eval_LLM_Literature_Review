{"Abstract": "Irmgard Flügge-Lotz was a pioneering figure in the field of flow computation, making significant contributions to the understanding of compressible boundary layers and aerodynamics control theory. Her work laid foundational principles that have influenced modern fluid mechanics. Born in 1903, Flügge-Lotz's career was marked by her tenure at Göttingen, where she emerged as a leading expert in the mathematical modeling of aerodynamic phenomena. Her research was instrumental in advancing the theoretical frameworks necessary for the development of control systems in aerodynamics, particularly during a time when computational resources were limited. As one of the few women in fluid mechanics during her era, Flügge-Lotz's achievements not only advanced the scientific community's understanding of flow dynamics but also paved the way for future generations of women in STEM fields. Her legacy is reflected in the continued relevance of her methodologies in contemporary aerodynamics and control theory, underscoring her role as a trailblazer in the field."}
