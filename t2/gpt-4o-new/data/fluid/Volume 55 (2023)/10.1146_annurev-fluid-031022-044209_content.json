{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of mathematical methods from quantum mechanics to linear flow analysis, focusing on the interplay between symmetries, degeneracy, and perturbations. By leveraging concepts such as exceptional points and spectral analysis, we aim to enhance the understanding of eigenvalue behavior and stability in linear systems. The research investigates how quantum mechanical techniques can be adapted to identify and characterize critical points in the parameter space of linear flows, where small perturbations can lead to significant changes in system dynamics. Through a detailed examination of symmetry-induced degeneracies, we provide insights into the stability properties of these systems. Our findings suggest that the incorporation of quantum-inspired methods offers a novel perspective on linear flow analysis, potentially leading to more robust predictions and control strategies in engineering and physical sciences. This interdisciplinary approach opens new avenues for research at the intersection of quantum mechanics and classical linear analysis."}
