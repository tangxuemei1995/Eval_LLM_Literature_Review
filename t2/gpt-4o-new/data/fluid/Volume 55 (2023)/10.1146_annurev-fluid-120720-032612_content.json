{"Abstract": "Rotating detonation engines (RDEs) represent a promising advancement in propulsion technology due to their potential for pressure gain combustion, which can enhance efficiency compared to traditional engines. However, the practical implementation of RDEs is challenged by several nonidealities that affect their performance. This study investigates the impact of unsteady mixing, secondary combustion, and deflagration loss on the operation of RDEs. The presence of multiple competing detonation waves and secondary waves can lead to complex flow dynamics, which are not fully understood. These phenomena can result in reduced efficiency and stability, as well as increased thermal and mechanical stresses on engine components. Through a combination of experimental observations and computational simulations, this research aims to elucidate the mechanisms by which these nonidealities influence the detonation wave structure and propagation. The findings suggest that optimizing the fuel-air mixing process and controlling the initiation and interaction of detonation waves are crucial for minimizing deflagration losses and enhancing overall engine performance. This work contributes to the development of more robust and efficient RDE designs, paving the way for their integration into future aerospace applications."}
