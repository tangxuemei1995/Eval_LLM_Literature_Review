{"Abstract": "The study of three-dimensional shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions (SWBLI) is crucial for understanding complex aerodynamic phenomena encountered in high-speed flight. This research investigates the dynamics of SWBLI, focusing on the interplay between shock waves and boundary layers in three-dimensional configurations. The interaction often leads to flow separation, increased turbulence, and significant pressure gradients, which can adversely affect the stability and performance of aerospace vehicles. Using advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and experimental techniques, we analyze the influence of three-dimensional effects on the shear layer development and the subsequent impact on flow stability. The study also explores the role of fluid/structure interactions in modifying the flow characteristics and the potential for flow control strategies to mitigate adverse effects. Results indicate that three-dimensional SWBLI can lead to complex flow patterns, including vortex formation and unsteady shock motion, which are sensitive to changes in boundary layer properties and shock strength. Understanding these interactions is essential for designing effective control mechanisms to enhance vehicle performance and safety. This research contributes to the broader field of aerodynamics by providing insights into the fundamental processes governing three-dimensional SWBLI and their implications for future aerospace applications."}
