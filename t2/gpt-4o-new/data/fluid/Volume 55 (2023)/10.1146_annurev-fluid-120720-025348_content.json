{"Abstract": "This study explores the transformative potential of tabletop experiments in advancing scientific research and education, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). By leveraging cost-effective and accessible experimental setups, researchers can overcome resource constraints, fostering innovation and scientific inquiry. The paper examines the role of tabletop experiments in enhancing graduate education and professional development, providing students and early-career scientists with hands-on experience and critical thinking skills. It highlights successful case studies where such approaches have democratized access to cutting-edge science, enabling researchers in LMICs to contribute significantly to global scientific discourse. The findings underscore the importance of supporting initiatives that promote resource-efficient research methodologies, ultimately broadening participation in the scientific community and driving equitable advancements in science and technology."}
