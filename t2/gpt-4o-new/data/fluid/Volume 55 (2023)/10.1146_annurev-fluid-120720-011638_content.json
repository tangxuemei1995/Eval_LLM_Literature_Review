{"Abstract": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow is a critical component of the central nervous system, playing a vital role in maintaining homeostasis and facilitating waste clearance via the glymphatic system. This study explores the dynamics of CSF flow through the lens of biological fluid mechanics, emphasizing the viscous properties that influence its movement. By integrating recent advances in imaging techniques and computational modeling, we provide a comprehensive analysis of CSF dynamics, highlighting the interplay between anatomical structures and fluid viscosity. Our findings underscore the importance of understanding CSF flow patterns in the context of neurological health and disease, offering insights into potential therapeutic interventions for conditions such as hydrocephalus and Alzheimer's disease. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the glymphatic system's role in brain health, emphasizing the need for further exploration of CSF flow mechanics."}
