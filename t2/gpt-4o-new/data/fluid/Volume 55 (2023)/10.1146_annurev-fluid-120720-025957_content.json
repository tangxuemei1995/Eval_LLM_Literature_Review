{"Abstract": "The transition to turbulence in pipe flow is a complex phenomenon characterized by the interplay of transient growth, turbulent puffs, and slugs. This study investigates the mechanisms underlying the onset of turbulence in shear flows, focusing on the role of transient chaos and intermittency. Through experimental and computational analyses, we explore how localized disturbances evolve into turbulent structures, highlighting the significance of transient growth in amplifying perturbations. The transition is further examined through the lens of directed percolation, providing insights into the spatial and temporal dynamics of turbulent puffs and slugs. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the critical thresholds and pathways leading to sustained turbulence in pipe flow systems."}
