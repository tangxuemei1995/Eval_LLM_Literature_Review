{"Abstract": "The fluid mechanics of deep-sea mining is a critical area of study, particularly concerning the transport and dispersion of sediment plumes. This research investigates the dynamics of sediment transport, focusing on the formation and behavior of turbidity currents generated during mining activities. Utilizing principles of physical oceanography, the study examines the settling and flocculation processes that influence sediment distribution and deposition on the seafloor. Advanced modeling techniques are employed to simulate the interactions between sediment particles and ocean currents, providing insights into the environmental impact of deep-sea mining operations. The findings highlight the complex interplay between hydrodynamic forces and sediment characteristics, offering a comprehensive understanding of plume behavior. This research contributes to the development of sustainable mining practices by informing strategies to mitigate the ecological consequences of sediment disturbance in deep-sea environments."}
