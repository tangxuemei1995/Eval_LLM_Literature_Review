{"Abstract": "This study investigates the evaporation dynamics of sessile droplets using mathematical models, focusing on diffusion-limited processes. We explore various evaporation modes and their impact on droplet lifetimes and deposition patterns. The research extends to multiple droplets, analyzing interactions and collective behavior. Our findings provide insights into optimizing applications in inkjet printing, coating technologies, and biological assays, where precise control over droplet evaporation is crucial. The models developed offer a comprehensive framework for predicting droplet behavior under varying environmental conditions."}
