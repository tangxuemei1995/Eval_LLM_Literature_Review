{"Abstract": "Particle rafts and armored droplets represent fascinating systems in the study of particle-laden interfaces, where particles self-assemble at fluid boundaries, leading to unique mechanical and structural properties. This research explores the interplay between buoyancy, capillarity, and elasticity in these systems, providing insights into their interfacial rheology. The self-assembly of particles at interfaces is driven by capillary forces, which can lead to the formation of stable structures with enhanced mechanical properties. These structures exhibit a range of behaviors, from fluid-like to solid-like, depending on particle concentration and interfacial tension. The study investigates how buoyancy influences the stability and morphology of particle rafts and armored droplets, revealing the critical role of particle size and density. Additionally, the research examines the elastic properties of these interfaces, highlighting their potential applications in materials science and engineering. By understanding the fundamental principles governing particle-laden interfaces, this work contributes to the development of novel materials with tailored properties. The findings have implications for various fields, including drug delivery, food science, and the design of advanced coatings, where control over interfacial properties is crucial. This study underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in unraveling the complexities of particle-laden systems."}
