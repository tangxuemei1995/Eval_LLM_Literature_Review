{"Abstract": "The study of free surface flows, particularly those involving singularities such as breakup and coalescence, is crucial for advancing technologies in inkjet printing, microfluidics, and spray systems. This research focuses on the development and application of sharp interface methods to simulate and analyze these complex phenomena. By employing finite element techniques, we accurately capture the dynamics of drops, jets, and filaments as they undergo critical transitions like pinch-off and merging. The sharp interface approach allows for precise tracking of the evolving interfaces, providing insights into the underlying physics of singularity formation and resolution. Our simulations reveal the intricate interplay between fluid properties and geometric constraints, offering predictive capabilities for optimizing industrial processes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of sharp interface methods in handling the challenges posed by free surface flows with singularities, paving the way for improved design and control in applications ranging from inkjet printing to advanced microfluidic devices. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of fluid dynamics in systems where interface behavior is pivotal."}
