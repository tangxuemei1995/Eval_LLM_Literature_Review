{"Abstract": "This study delves into the complex dynamics of turbulent spots, which are critical in understanding the transition from laminar to turbulent flow in various fluid systems. By examining turbulent spots across different flow configurations, including boundary layers, pipe flow, channel flow, plane Couette flow, turbomachinery flow, and hypersonic flow, we provide new insights into their formation, evolution, and interaction mechanisms. Advanced computational simulations and experimental techniques reveal the influence of flow parameters on spot characteristics and their role in the transition process. Our findings highlight the universality and variability of turbulent spots across different flow regimes, offering potential pathways for controlling transition in engineering applications. This research contributes to the broader understanding of turbulence, with implications for improving efficiency and performance in aerodynamics and fluid machinery."}
