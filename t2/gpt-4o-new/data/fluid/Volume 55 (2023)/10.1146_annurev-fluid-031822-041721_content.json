{"Abstract": "The study of fluid mechanics has been significantly advanced by the development of 3D Lagrangian Particle Tracking (LPT) techniques, which provide detailed insights into the dynamics of fluid flows. This paper focuses on the application of 3D particle tracking velocimetry, particularly the iterative particle reconstruction method known as Shake-The-Box, to capture high-resolution velocity fields. By employing one- and multipoint statistics, we analyze the velocity gradient tensor to better understand the underlying flow structures. The integration of these techniques facilitates the reconstruction of 3D pressure fields, offering a comprehensive view of the fluid dynamics. Furthermore, data assimilation methods are utilized to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the reconstructed flow fields. This research not only advances the methodological framework for LPT but also contributes to the broader understanding of complex fluid systems, with implications for both theoretical studies and practical applications in engineering and environmental sciences."}
