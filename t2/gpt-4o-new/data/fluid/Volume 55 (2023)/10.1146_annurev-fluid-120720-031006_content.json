{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in the study of inhomogeneous and anisotropic turbulence have focused on quasi-linear approaches and statistical methods to better understand complex flow dynamics. These developments have provided new insights into the behavior of turbulent flows under varying conditions, highlighting the importance of anisotropy and inhomogeneity in turbulence modeling. By integrating theoretical and computational techniques, researchers have improved predictions of turbulent behavior, offering potential applications in engineering and environmental sciences."}
