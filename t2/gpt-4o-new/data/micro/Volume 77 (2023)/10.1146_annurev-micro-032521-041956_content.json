{"Abstract": "The assembly of microbial communities in fermented foods is a complex process influenced by various biotic and abiotic factors. This study explores the dynamics of microbiome assembly in diverse fermented food matrices, including cheese, sourdough, and fermented vegetables. By examining the interactions between microbial species and their environmental conditions, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms driving community structure and function. Our findings highlight the role of initial microbial inocula, substrate composition, and fermentation conditions in shaping the microbiome. In cheese, specific bacterial and fungal interactions are crucial for flavor development, while in sourdough, the balance between lactic acid bacteria and yeasts determines dough properties. Fermented vegetables exhibit a dynamic succession of microbial populations, influenced by salt concentration and temperature. Understanding these processes provides insights into optimizing fermentation practices for improved food quality and safety, and offers potential applications in developing novel fermented products with tailored microbial profiles."}
