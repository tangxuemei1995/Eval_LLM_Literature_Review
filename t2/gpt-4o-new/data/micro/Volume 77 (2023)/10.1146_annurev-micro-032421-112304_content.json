{"Abstract": "The human gut microbiome plays a crucial role in health and disease, yet its complexity poses challenges for genetic manipulation. This study explores advancements in microbiome engineering by expanding the repertoire of genetically tractable gut microbiota. We review recent developments in genetic tools and techniques that facilitate the manipulation of diverse microbial species within the gut ecosystem. Emphasis is placed on the identification and characterization of key microbial members amenable to genetic engineering, alongside novel methodologies for gene editing and synthetic biology applications. By enhancing our ability to genetically modify these organisms, we aim to unlock new therapeutic potentials and improve our understanding of host-microbe interactions. This work underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in microbiome research, paving the way for innovative strategies in precision medicine and personalized healthcare."}
