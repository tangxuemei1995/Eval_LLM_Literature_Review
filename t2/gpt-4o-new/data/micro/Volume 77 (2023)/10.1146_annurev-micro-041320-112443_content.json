{"Abstract": "Fungal genomes exhibit remarkable plasticity, enabling rapid adaptation to environmental stressors through mechanisms such as polyploidy, aneuploidy, and copy number variation (CNV). This study explores the dynamic nature of fungal genomes, highlighting how these genetic alterations contribute to survival and adaptation under stress conditions. Polyploidy, the presence of multiple sets of chromosomes, can enhance genetic diversity and resilience, while aneuploidy, the gain or loss of individual chromosomes, allows for flexible gene dosage adjustments. CNVs further contribute to genomic adaptability by altering the number of copies of specific genes, thereby influencing phenotypic traits. Together, these genomic strategies facilitate rapid evolutionary responses, providing fungi with a competitive edge in fluctuating environments. Understanding these processes not only sheds light on fungal biology but also has implications for managing fungal pathogens and exploiting fungi in biotechnology."}
