{"Abstract": "Fungi are increasingly recognized for their adaptability to extreme environments, including glacial and hypersaline ecosystems. This study explores the diversity, ecological roles, and adaptive mechanisms of fungi inhabiting these harsh conditions. In glacial environments, psychrophilic fungi exhibit unique adaptations to low temperatures, contributing to nutrient cycling and organic matter decomposition. Conversely, hypersaline environments host halophilic fungi that thrive in high salinity, often participating in biogeochemical processes and symbiotic relationships. The extremophilic nature of these fungi is attributed to specialized metabolic pathways, stress response mechanisms, and unique cellular structures. By integrating molecular techniques and environmental sampling, this research provides insights into the evolutionary strategies that enable fungi to colonize and persist in such diverse and challenging habitats. Understanding these mechanisms not only enhances our knowledge of fungal biodiversity but also has potential applications in biotechnology and climate change studies."}
