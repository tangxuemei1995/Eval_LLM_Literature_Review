{"Abstract": "Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) is a reproductive phenomenon induced by Wolbachia, a widespread endosymbiotic bacterium, affecting numerous arthropod species. This study delves into the molecular biology underlying CI, focusing on the roles of specific Wolbachia-encoded proteins, including nucleases and deubiquitylases, which act as toxins. These proteins disrupt normal cellular processes in host organisms, leading to male killing and other reproductive alterations. By examining the interaction between these bacterial proteins and host cellular machinery, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms by which Wolbachia manipulates host reproduction to enhance its own transmission. Our findings suggest that the nuclease and deubiquitylase activities are crucial for the induction of CI, providing insights into the evolutionary dynamics of host-symbiont interactions. Understanding these molecular interactions not only sheds light on the complex biology of Wolbachia but also opens avenues for potential applications in pest control and biodiversity conservation through the manipulation of CI."}
