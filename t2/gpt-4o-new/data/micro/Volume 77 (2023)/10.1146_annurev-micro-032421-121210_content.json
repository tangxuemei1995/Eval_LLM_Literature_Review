{"Abstract": "The emergence of drug-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum necessitates the development of novel antimalarial therapies. Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), essential enzymes responsible for tRNA charging, represent promising targets for antimalarial drug development. This study explores the potential of reaction hijacking, a strategy that exploits the unique catalytic mechanisms of aaRSs, to selectively inhibit the growth of the malaria parasite. By targeting the aaRSs, which are crucial for protein synthesis, we aim to disrupt the parasite's life cycle without affecting the host. Our research identifies specific aaRS inhibitors that demonstrate potent antimalarial activity in vitro, with minimal cytotoxicity to human cells. These findings underscore the viability of aaRSs as drug targets and pave the way for the development of new therapeutic agents. Further investigation into the structure-activity relationships of these inhibitors could lead to the optimization of their efficacy and selectivity."}
