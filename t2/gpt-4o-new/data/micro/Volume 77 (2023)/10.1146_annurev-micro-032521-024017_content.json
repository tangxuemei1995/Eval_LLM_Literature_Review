{"Abstract": "Inflammasomes are pivotal components of the innate immune system, orchestrating responses to pathogenic bacteria through the activation of caspase-1 and caspase-8, leading to pyroptosis via gasdermin-mediated pore formation. This study explores the dual role of bacterial influencers in modulating inflammasome signaling, either collaborating with or canceling the host's immune response. We examine the interactions between bacterial components and Nod-like receptors (NLRs), which serve as sensors for inflammasome assembly. The research highlights how specific bacterial species can either potentiate or inhibit inflammasome activation, affecting the downstream signaling pathways and the resultant inflammatory response. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms of these interactions, we aim to provide insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting inflammasome-related diseases. Our findings underscore the complexity of host-pathogen interactions and the potential for manipulating bacterial influences to modulate immune responses."}
