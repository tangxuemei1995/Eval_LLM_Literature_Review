{"Abstract": "Transporter proteins play a pivotal role in the ecological adaptability and survival of microbial eukaryotes, serving as crucial components of both core and accessory genomes. This study explores the dual nature of transporter proteins as ecological assets and integral features of microbial eukaryotic pangenomes. By facilitating nutrient uptake, waste removal, and environmental sensing, these proteins contribute significantly to microbial adaptation and virulence. The research highlights the dynamic nature of transporter proteins, emphasizing their evolution through horizontal gene transfer and gene duplication events. These processes enable microbial eukaryotes to expand their functional repertoire, enhancing their ability to thrive in diverse ecological niches. The study further investigates the balance between core and accessory genomes, illustrating how transporter proteins can transition between these categories to meet environmental demands. This research underscores the importance of transporter proteins in microbial ecology and evolution, providing insights into their role in shaping the genetic landscape of microbial eukaryotes."}
