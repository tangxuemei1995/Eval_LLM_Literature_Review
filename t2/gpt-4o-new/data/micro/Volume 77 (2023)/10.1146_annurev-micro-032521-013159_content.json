{"Abstract": "The Brucella cell envelope plays a critical role in the pathogenicity and survival of this gram-negative, intracellular bacterium, which is a significant zoonotic threat. As a member of the Alphaproteobacteria class, Brucella spp. possess a unique cell envelope structure that facilitates its evasion of host immune responses and supports its intracellular lifestyle. This review explores the composition and function of the Brucella cell envelope, highlighting its role in the bacterium's ability to persist within host cells. Key components such as the outer membrane, lipopolysaccharides, and peptidoglycan layer are examined for their contributions to virulence and immune modulation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the Brucella cell envelope may provide insights into novel therapeutic targets for controlling brucellosis, a disease with significant public health and economic impacts worldwide. This study underscores the importance of continued research into the cell envelope's role in Brucella pathogenicity."}
