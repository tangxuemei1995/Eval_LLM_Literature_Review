{"Abstract": "Type III secretion systems (T3SS) are pivotal for the pathogenicity and motility of many Gram-negative bacteria, functioning as molecular syringes to translocate effector proteins into host cells. This study provides comprehensive structural insights into the T3SS of the bacterial flagellum and injectisome, utilizing advanced cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) techniques. By resolving high-resolution structures, we elucidate the intricate architecture and dynamic assembly of these complex nanomachines. Our findings reveal conserved structural motifs and unique adaptations that facilitate their dual roles in motility and virulence. The comparative analysis highlights the evolutionary divergence between the flagellar and injectisome T3SS, offering a deeper understanding of their functional specialization. These insights not only enhance our knowledge of bacterial pathogenesis and motility but also pave the way for the development of novel antimicrobial strategies targeting these essential bacterial systems. This research underscores the potential of cryo-EM and cryo-ET in unraveling the complexities of bacterial secretion systems at the molecular level."}
