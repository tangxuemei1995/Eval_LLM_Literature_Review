{"Abstract": "The emergence of metazoan multicellularity represents a pivotal event in the history of life, yet its origins remain enigmatic. This study explores the hypothesis that the transition from unicellular to multicellular life forms in metazoans may have been precipitated by a microbial 'black swan' eventâ€”an unexpected and transformative occurrence. By integrating genomic data from extant holozoans, the closest unicellular relatives of metazoans, we aim to reconstruct the genomic landscape of the last unicellular ancestor. Our analysis reveals key genetic innovations, including the expansion of gene families associated with cell adhesion, communication, and differentiation, which may have facilitated the evolution of complex multicellular structures. Furthermore, we examine the role of environmental pressures and symbiotic interactions with microbial communities in driving these genomic changes. The findings suggest that the origin of metazoan multicellularity was not a gradual process but rather a rapid evolutionary leap, potentially triggered by a unique set of ecological and genetic circumstances. This research underscores the importance of considering rare and unpredictable events in evolutionary biology and provides new insights into the complex interplay between unicellular organisms and their environments in the emergence of multicellular life."}
