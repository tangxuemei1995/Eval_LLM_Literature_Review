{"Abstract": "Extracytoplasmic function (ECF) σ factors represent a crucial component of bacterial signal transduction, serving as the third pillar alongside two-component systems and one-component systems. These σ factors are pivotal in modulating transcription initiation in response to environmental stress, thereby facilitating adaptive gene regulation. This review delves into the evolutionary distribution and regulatory diversity of ECF σ factors across diverse bacterial taxa. Through comparative genomics, we explore the structural and functional variations that underpin their role in stress response and signal transduction. The study highlights the intricate mechanisms by which ECF σ factors integrate external signals to orchestrate precise transcriptional responses, underscoring their significance in bacterial adaptability and survival. Furthermore, we discuss emerging insights into the future potential of ECF σ factors as targets for novel antimicrobial strategies. This comprehensive analysis provides a foundation for understanding the dynamic regulatory networks mediated by ECF σ factors and their impact on bacterial physiology."}
