{"Abstract": "Apicomplexan parasites, including Plasmodium and Toxoplasma, possess mitochondria with unique structural and functional properties that distinguish them from those of their hosts. These mitochondria are characterized by a divergent ATP synthase and electron transport complexes, which are essential for the parasites' energy metabolism and survival. The atypical nature of these mitochondrial components presents a promising target for the development of novel antiparasitic drugs. Recent studies have elucidated the distinct architecture and biochemical pathways of apicomplexan mitochondria, revealing potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically. The differences in mitochondrial function between apicomplexans and their hosts underscore the potential for selective drug targeting, minimizing host toxicity. Understanding the unique properties of apicomplexan mitochondria not only advances our knowledge of parasite biology but also aids in the design of innovative strategies to combat diseases such as malaria and toxoplasmosis. This research highlights the critical role of mitochondrial biology in the development of effective antiparasitic therapies."}
