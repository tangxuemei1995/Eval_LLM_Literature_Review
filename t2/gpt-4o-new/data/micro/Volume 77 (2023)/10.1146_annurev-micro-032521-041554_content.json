{"Abstract": "Malaria, caused by Plasmodium parasites, remains a significant global health challenge. Recent advances in single-cell technologies have unveiled the intricate epigenetic landscape and chromatin architecture of these parasites. This study explores the role of epigenetic regulation, focusing on long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and their impact on chromatin remodeling. We highlight how lncRNAs contribute to the dynamic regulation of gene expression, facilitating the parasite's adaptation to host environments. By dissecting the chromatin architecture at a single-cell level, we provide insights into the mechanisms underlying Plasmodium's developmental stages and pathogenicity. Understanding these epigenetic processes opens new avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions, potentially disrupting the parasite's life cycle and offering novel strategies for malaria control and eradication."}
