{"Abstract": "The human gut phageome, a critical component of the gut microbiome, plays a significant role in maintaining health and influencing disease states. This study explores the factors contributing to the variation in the human gut phageome, focusing on bacteriophages, which are viruses that infect bacteria. Key factors include diet, age, genetics, antibiotic use, and environmental exposures, all of which can alter the composition and diversity of the gut virome. The interaction between bacteriophages and their bacterial hosts is crucial for modulating microbial communities, impacting gut health and disease susceptibility. Variations in the phageome can influence the balance of beneficial and pathogenic bacteria, potentially affecting conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and infections. Understanding these variations provides insights into the dynamic nature of the gut ecosystem and its implications for personalized medicine. This research underscores the importance of integrating phageome analysis into broader microbiome studies to develop targeted therapeutic strategies for maintaining gut health and preventing disease."}
