{"Abstract": "Candida auris is an emerging multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen that poses significant challenges to global health. This study explores the genetic basis of its resistance to antifungal drugs, including azoles, amphotericin B, and echinocandins. We investigate the role of cell wall integrity and MAP kinase signaling pathways in mediating resistance mechanisms. Genomic analyses reveal mutations and overexpression in genes associated with drug targets and efflux pumps, contributing to its resilience against conventional treatments. The study highlights the critical involvement of MAP kinase signaling in regulating cell wall biosynthesis and stress responses, which are pivotal for C. auris survival under antifungal pressure. Understanding these genetic and molecular mechanisms is essential for developing novel therapeutic strategies and improving clinical management of C. auris infections. Our findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced surveillance and innovative approaches to combat this formidable pathogen."}
