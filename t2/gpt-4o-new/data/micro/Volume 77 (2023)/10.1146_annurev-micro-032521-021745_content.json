{"Abstract": "Recent advances in understanding the hypoxia response of human fungal pathogens have unveiled critical insights into disease progression and virulence. Hypoxia, or low oxygen conditions, is a common feature in host environments that pathogens encounter during infection. Fungal adaptation to hypoxia is crucial for survival and virulence, influencing disease outcomes. This review highlights the molecular mechanisms fungi employ to sense and respond to hypoxic conditions, and how these pathways contribute to pathogenicity. Understanding these processes opens new avenues for developing targeted antifungal therapies, potentially improving treatment efficacy and patient outcomes in fungal infections."}
