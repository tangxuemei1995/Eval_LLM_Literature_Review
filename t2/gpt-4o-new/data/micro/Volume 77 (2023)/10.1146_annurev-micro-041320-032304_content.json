{"Abstract": "The study of habitat transition in bacteria and archaea offers critical insights into microbial evolution, particularly in the context of dispersal and adaptation. This research explores the evolutionary mechanisms that enable these microorganisms to transition between diverse environments, focusing on the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) bacteria and their role in the human microbiome. By examining genomic adaptations and ecological strategies, we aim to elucidate how these microorganisms navigate and thrive in varied habitats. The findings highlight the significance of horizontal gene transfer and metabolic versatility in facilitating habitat transitions. Furthermore, the study underscores the impact of environmental microbiology on shaping microbial communities, with implications for understanding human microbiome evolution. This research contributes to a broader comprehension of microbial diversity and the evolutionary processes that underpin the adaptability and resilience of bacteria and archaea across different ecological niches."}
