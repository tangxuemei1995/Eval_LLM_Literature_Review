{"Abstract": "The phc quorum-sensing system plays a pivotal role in the regulation of pathogenicity and virulence in the Ralstonia solanacearum species complex, which includes Ralstonia solanacearum and Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum. This study explores the molecular mechanisms underlying cellâ€“cell communication mediated by the phc system, highlighting its influence on bacterial behavior and host interaction. Through a comprehensive analysis of gene expression and phenotypic assays, we demonstrate that the phc system modulates key virulence factors, including exopolysaccharide production and motility, which are crucial for successful infection and colonization of host plants. Our findings provide insights into the adaptive strategies employed by these pathogens and underscore the potential of targeting quorum-sensing pathways as a novel approach for controlling bacterial wilt disease. This research advances our understanding of microbial communication and its impact on plant-microbe interactions, offering new avenues for sustainable agricultural practices."}
