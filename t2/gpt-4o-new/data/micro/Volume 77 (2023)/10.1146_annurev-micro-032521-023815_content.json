{"Abstract": "Bacterial cross-feeding, a pivotal aspect of microbial ecology, involves the transfer of metabolites between microbial species, often facilitated by the phenomenon of 'leakiness.' This study explores the mechanisms underlying metabolite externalization in bacteria, focusing on the roles of efflux systems and passive diffusion. We examine how these processes contribute to the metabolic interdependence observed in microbial communities. By integrating recent advances in microbial metabolism and interactions, we highlight the conditions under which bacteria become 'leaky,' allowing metabolites to exit the cell and become available to neighboring organisms. Our findings suggest that efflux pumps, membrane permeability, and environmental factors collectively influence metabolite release, thereby shaping community structure and function. Understanding these mechanisms provides insights into the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of microbial consortia, with implications for biotechnology and ecosystem management."}
