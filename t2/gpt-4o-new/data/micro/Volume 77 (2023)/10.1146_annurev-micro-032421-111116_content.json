{"Abstract": "TonB-dependent transport systems are crucial for the active transport of nutrients across the bacterial outer membrane, particularly in Gram-negative bacteria. These systems utilize energy from the proton motive force to facilitate the uptake of essential molecules, such as iron-siderophore complexes, through Î² barrel proteins. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of exploiting these pathways for the delivery of Trojan horse antibiotics, offering a novel approach to combat antibiotic resistance. In Bacteroidetes, a diverse phylum of bacteria, TonB-dependent transporters play a significant role in nutrient acquisition and pathogenicity. Understanding the structural and functional dynamics of these transporters could lead to innovative strategies for targeting bacterial infections, emphasizing the importance of continued research in this area."}
