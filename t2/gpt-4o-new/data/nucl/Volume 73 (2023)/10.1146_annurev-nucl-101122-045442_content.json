{"Abstract": "The study of lepton flavor violation (LFV) and lepton flavor universality violation (LFUV) in b and c decays offers a promising avenue for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Recent experimental results from LHCb have indicated potential deviations from the expected symmetries of fundamental interactions, suggesting the presence of new particles or forces. This research focuses on analyzing heavy meson decays to identify LFV and LFUV signatures, which could provide critical insights into the underlying mechanisms of BSM physics. By examining the decay patterns and branching ratios, this study aims to enhance our understanding of lepton interactions and contribute to the development of a more comprehensive theoretical framework that extends beyond the current Standard Model."}
