{"Abstract": "This study investigates the presence of radioisotopes in deep-sea sediments and lunar samples, potentially originating from nearby astrophysical explosions such as supernovae. By employing accelerator mass spectrometry, we aim to detect isotopic signatures indicative of r-process nucleosynthesis, a process responsible for the creation of heavy elements in explosive stellar environments. The analysis focuses on isotopes with half-lives suitable for tracing recent astrophysical events, providing insights into the frequency and proximity of such explosions relative to Earth and the Moon. Our findings could enhance understanding of the cosmic origin of elements and the impact of supernovae on the solar system's isotopic composition, offering a unique perspective on nucleosynthetic processes in the universe."}
