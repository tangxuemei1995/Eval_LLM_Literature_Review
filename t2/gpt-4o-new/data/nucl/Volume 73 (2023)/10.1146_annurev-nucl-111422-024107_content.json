{"Abstract": "The Hubble tension, a significant discrepancy between the Hubble constant values derived from local measurements and those inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations, has emerged as a pivotal challenge in modern cosmology. This tension suggests potential new physics beyond the standard Î›CDM model. One promising avenue to resolve this discrepancy involves the introduction of early dark energy (EDE), a hypothetical form of energy that could have influenced the Universe's expansion rate during the pre-recombination era. This study explores the implications of EDE on the CMB and large-scale structure, examining how its presence could reconcile the observed Hubble constant values. By employing a combination of observational data, including CMB anisotropies, baryon acoustic oscillations, and supernovae, we assess the viability of EDE models. Our findings indicate that EDE can alleviate the Hubble tension by modifying the sound horizon at recombination, thus affecting the inferred Hubble constant. However, the introduction of EDE also necessitates careful consideration of its impact on other cosmological parameters and the overall consistency with observational data. This research underscores the importance of EDE in addressing the Hubble tension and highlights the need for further theoretical and observational efforts to fully understand its role in the early Universe."}
