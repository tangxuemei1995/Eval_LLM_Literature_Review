{"Abstract": "In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the formation of a quark–gluon plasma (QGP) provides a unique environment to study the properties of strongly interacting matter. One of the key phenomena observed in these collisions is jet quenching, where high-energy partons lose energy as they traverse the QGP, leading to modifications in the jet structure. This study focuses on the medium response to jet propagation and the resulting jet–hadron correlations. By analyzing the angular and momentum distributions of hadrons associated with jets, insights into the mechanisms of jet-induced medium excitation are obtained. The correlation patterns reveal the interplay between energy loss mechanisms and medium-induced modifications, offering a window into the transport properties of the QGP. Advanced theoretical models and experimental data from facilities such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) are employed to interpret the observed phenomena. This research enhances our understanding of the QGP's dynamic response to energetic probes, contributing to the broader field of high-energy nuclear physics."}
