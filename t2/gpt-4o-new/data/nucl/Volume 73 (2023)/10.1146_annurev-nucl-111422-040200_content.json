{"Abstract": "This study explores the interactions of high-energy to ultrahigh-energy neutrinos, focusing on their astrophysical origins and detection methods. Neutrinos, being weakly interacting particles, provide unique insights into cosmic phenomena and extreme environments. We analyze the cross-sections and interaction rates of neutrinos with matter, emphasizing their role in probing the universe's most energetic processes. The research highlights advancements in neutrino detection technologies and their implications for understanding fundamental physics and cosmology. Our findings contribute to the growing field of neutrino astrophysics, offering new perspectives on the universe's high-energy landscape."}
