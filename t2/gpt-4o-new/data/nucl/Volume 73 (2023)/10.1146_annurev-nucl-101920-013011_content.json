{"Abstract": "This guide explores methodologies for detecting long-lived particles (LLPs) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It emphasizes innovative detector technologies and analysis techniques crucial for identifying LLP signatures, which often evade traditional detection methods. By integrating theoretical models with experimental strategies, this work aims to enhance the discovery potential of LLPs, offering insights into physics beyond the Standard Model and contributing to our understanding of fundamental particle interactions."}
