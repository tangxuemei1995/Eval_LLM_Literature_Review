{"Abstract": "The gauge hierarchy problem, a fundamental issue in particle physics, questions why the Higgs boson mass is so much lighter than the Planck scale, despite quantum corrections that suggest it should be much heavier. This paper explores novel solutions to this problem, focusing on the concepts of hierarchy and naturalness. We examine recent advancements in theoretical frameworks that propose mechanisms for the stabilization of the Higgs mass without fine-tuning. One promising approach is the relaxation mechanism, which introduces a dynamical field that adjusts the Higgs mass to its observed value. This mechanism offers a natural explanation for the smallness of the Higgs mass by dynamically canceling large quantum corrections. Additionally, we discuss the implications of these solutions for beyond the Standard Model physics, including potential experimental signatures that could be observed at current and future collider experiments. By addressing the gauge hierarchy problem through innovative theoretical constructs, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of fundamental forces and particles, potentially guiding the next generation of particle physics discoveries."}
