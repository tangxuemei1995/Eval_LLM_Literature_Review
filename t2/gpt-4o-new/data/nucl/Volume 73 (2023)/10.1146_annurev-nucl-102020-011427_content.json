{"Abstract": "The top quark, the heaviest known elementary particle, plays a pivotal role in probing physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). This research explores the potential of the top quark to address unresolved issues such as the hierarchy problem, flavor anomalies, and the nature of dark matter. By examining top quark interactions and properties, we aim to uncover signatures of New Physics, including potential new particles or forces. The study leverages advanced theoretical models and experimental data from high-energy colliders to investigate deviations from Standard Model predictions. Our findings could provide critical insights into the fundamental structure of matter and the universe, offering pathways to a more comprehensive theory of particle physics."}
