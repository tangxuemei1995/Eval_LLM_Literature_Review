{"Abstract": "Ultra-high-energy gamma-ray astronomy has emerged as a pivotal field in understanding the most energetic processes in the universe. This study focuses on the detection and analysis of gamma rays with energies exceeding 100 TeV, often associated with PeVatrons, which are astrophysical sources capable of accelerating particles to peta-electronvolt energies. The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) plays a crucial role in this research, providing unprecedented sensitivity and resolution in the detection of extensive air showers produced by these gamma rays. By examining the muon content of these showers, researchers can distinguish between gamma-ray and cosmic-ray events, enhancing the accuracy of source identification. The Crab Nebula, a well-known cosmic accelerator, serves as a benchmark for calibrating instruments and validating detection techniques due to its consistent emission of high-energy gamma rays. This paper presents recent findings from LHAASO, highlighting the discovery of new PeVatron candidates and the implications for our understanding of cosmic ray origins and propagation. The results underscore the importance of multi-wavelength and multi-messenger approaches in gamma-ray astronomy, as they provide complementary insights into the mechanisms driving these extreme astrophysical phenomena. Future directions include refining detection methods and expanding observational campaigns to further explore the high-energy universe, ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive cosmic ray model and advancing our knowledge of the fundamental processes governing the cosmos."}
