{"Abstract": "The detection and calibration of low-energy nuclear recoils are pivotal for advancing dark matter and coherent elastic neutrino nucleus scattering (CEÎ½NS) experiments. This study explores innovative methodologies for accurately measuring nuclear recoils at sub-keV energy levels, which are crucial for identifying potential dark matter interactions and neutrino scattering events. We employ advanced neutron scattering techniques to simulate and calibrate low-energy recoil events, ensuring precise energy scale determination. Our approach integrates state-of-the-art detector technologies with sophisticated data analysis algorithms to enhance sensitivity and resolution. The results demonstrate significant improvements in recoil energy calibration, reducing systematic uncertainties and enhancing the reliability of experimental outcomes. This work not only contributes to the fundamental understanding of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) and neutrino properties but also sets a new benchmark for future low-energy nuclear recoil detection in particle physics research."}
