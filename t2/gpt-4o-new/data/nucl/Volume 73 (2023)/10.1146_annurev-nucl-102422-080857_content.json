{"Abstract": "The s process, or slow neutron capture process, is a critical mechanism in nucleosynthesis, responsible for producing approximately half of the elements heavier than iron. This study explores the intricacies of the s process within asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and massive stars, examining the conditions under which neutron captures occur. By integrating stellar spectroscopy data and analyzing meteoritic anomalies, we aim to enhance our understanding of the elemental abundances and isotopic compositions resulting from these nuclear reactions. Our findings provide insights into the astrophysical sites and conditions conducive to the s process, offering a comprehensive view of its role in stellar evolution and the chemical enrichment of the galaxy."}
