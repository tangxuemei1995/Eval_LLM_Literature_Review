{"Abstract": "The study of bosonâ€“boson interactions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) provides critical insights into the electroweak sector of the Standard Model and potential new physics beyond it. This research focuses on diboson production and vector boson scattering processes, which are key to understanding the self-interactions of gauge bosons and the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. Utilizing data from the LHC's high-energy proton-proton collisions, we analyze events involving pairs of W, Z, and photon bosons. Advanced techniques in event reconstruction and background suppression are employed to enhance the sensitivity to these rare processes. The results are compared with theoretical predictions, including those from the Standard Model and various beyond-the-Standard-Model scenarios. This study not only tests the robustness of the electroweak theory but also explores the potential for discovering new particles or interactions. The findings contribute to refining our understanding of fundamental forces and guiding future experimental and theoretical efforts in particle physics."}
