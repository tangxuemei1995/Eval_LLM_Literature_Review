{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in charm physics have significantly enhanced our understanding of leptonic and semileptonic decays of charmed hadrons. Utilizing lattice quantum chromodynamics, researchers have refined calculations of decay constants and form factors, crucial for probing the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix elements. These developments have improved the precision of theoretical predictions, facilitating more accurate tests of lepton flavor universality. Experimental data from high-energy physics facilities have been instrumental in validating these theoretical models, revealing potential deviations that could indicate new physics beyond the Standard Model. This review synthesizes recent progress, highlighting the interplay between theoretical innovations and experimental findings in the study of charmed hadron decays."}
