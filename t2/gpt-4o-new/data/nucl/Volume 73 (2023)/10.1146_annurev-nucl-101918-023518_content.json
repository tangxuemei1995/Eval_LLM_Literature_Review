{"Abstract": "The COHERENT experiment at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) is a pioneering effort to study coherent elastic neutrinoâ€“nucleus scattering (CEvNS), a process predicted by the Standard Model but only recently observed. Utilizing the intense neutrino flux produced at SNS, COHERENT aims to measure CEvNS across various target materials, providing critical insights into neutrino interactions. These measurements have significant implications for understanding supernova neutrinos, as CEvNS is a dominant interaction in supernova environments. Additionally, the experiment's findings contribute to the search for dark matter, as CEvNS shares similarities with potential dark matter interactions. By refining our knowledge of neutrino properties and interactions, COHERENT enhances our understanding of fundamental physics and aids in the development of new models that could explain phenomena beyond the Standard Model. The experiment's results are crucial for both theoretical advancements and practical applications in neutrino physics."}
