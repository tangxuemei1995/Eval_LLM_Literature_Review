{"Abstract": "The 30×30 initiative, which aims to conserve 30% of the planet's land and oceans by 2030, represents a pivotal strategy in addressing the dual crises of biodiversity loss and climate change. This paper explores the historical development and future potential of climate change-integrated conservation strategies within the framework of the 30×30 target. The initiative is rooted in the recognition that traditional conservation approaches must evolve to incorporate the dynamic nature of ecosystems under climate change, particularly as species distributions shift and new ecological interactions emerge. \n\nThe integration of climate change considerations into conservation planning is essential for enhancing the resilience of ecosystems and the services they provide. This involves systematic conservation planning that accounts for climate change biology, including the identification of climate refugia and corridors that facilitate species movement. The paper reviews the progress made in regional coordination efforts, highlighting successful case studies where cross-border collaboration has enhanced conservation outcomes. \n\nFurthermore, the paper discusses the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing the 30×30 target, emphasizing the need for adaptive management strategies that are informed by the latest scientific research. It underscores the importance of incorporating indigenous knowledge and local stakeholder engagement in conservation planning to ensure that strategies are culturally appropriate and socially equitable. \n\nThe future of climate change-integrated conservation strategies lies in the ability to leverage technological advancements, such as remote sensing and artificial intelligence, to improve monitoring and decision-making processes. The paper concludes by advocating for a holistic approach that aligns conservation efforts with broader sustainable development goals, ensuring that the 30×30 target contributes to both biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. By fostering a global commitment to these integrated strategies, the 30×30 initiative has the potential to transform conservation practices and secure a sustainable future for both people and nature."}
