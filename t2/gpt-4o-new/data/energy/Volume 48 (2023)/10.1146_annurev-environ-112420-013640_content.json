{"Abstract": "The Anthropocene epoch is characterized by significant human impact on Earth's ecological systems, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of industrial influences on biodiversity and land-use change. This study employs Earth system science to map and analyze the complex interactions between industrial activities and ecological dynamics. By integrating data on land-use change and biodiversity conservation, we identify critical areas where industrial pressures threaten ecological integrity. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating social-ecological systems into conservation planning to mitigate adverse effects and promote sustainable development. The research underscores the need for interdisciplinary approaches to address the challenges posed by industrialization in the Anthropocene, offering insights into effective strategies for preserving biodiversity and maintaining ecological balance. This work contributes to the growing body of knowledge aimed at informing policy and guiding conservation efforts in an increasingly industrialized world."}
