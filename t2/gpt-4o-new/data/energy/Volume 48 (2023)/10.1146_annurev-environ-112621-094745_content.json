{"Abstract": "Brine, a highly concentrated solution of salt in water, is a significant natural resource with diverse applications and origins. This study explores the genesis of brine, focusing on its formation in salt lakes and other natural reservoirs. The research delves into the processes that lead to the accumulation of valuable minerals such as potash and lithium, which are critical for various industrial applications. By examining the geochemical and hydrological conditions conducive to brine formation, the study provides insights into the sustainable extraction and utilization of these resources. Advanced processing techniques are evaluated for their efficiency in recovering valuable minerals while minimizing environmental impact. The comprehensive utilization of brine not only addresses the growing demand for minerals like lithium, essential for battery production, but also promotes sustainable practices in resource management. This research underscores the importance of innovative approaches in the processing and recovery of brine-derived resources, contributing to a more sustainable and resource-efficient future. The findings have global implications, offering strategies for optimizing brine resource recovery worldwide."}
