{"Abstract": "The transition to renewable energy sources is pivotal in addressing global energy demands and mitigating climate change. This study comprehensively evaluates the global technical, economic, and feasible potential of renewable electricity, focusing on solar photovoltaic (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP), wind, hydropower, geothermal, and ocean energy. By integrating advanced modeling techniques and extensive datasets, we assess the capacity of these technologies to meet future energy needs. The technical potential is quantified by considering the maximum possible energy output based on available resources and current technological capabilities. Economic potential is evaluated by analyzing cost-competitiveness with conventional energy sources, factoring in technological advancements and market dynamics. Feasible potential is determined by incorporating socio-political, environmental, and infrastructural constraints that may limit deployment.\n\nOur findings reveal that solar PV and wind energy exhibit the highest technical potential due to their widespread availability and rapid technological advancements. CSP, while less widespread, offers significant potential in regions with high solar insolation. Hydropower remains a crucial component, particularly in regions with abundant water resources, though its expansion is limited by environmental and social considerations. Geothermal energy presents substantial potential in tectonically active regions, while ocean energy, though nascent, holds promise for future development.\n\nEconomically, solar PV and onshore wind are increasingly competitive, with costs continuing to decline. However, the feasible potential is often constrained by land use, regulatory frameworks, and grid integration challenges. The study underscores the importance of policy interventions, technological innovation, and international cooperation to unlock the full potential of renewables. By providing a detailed analysis of the global renewable electricity landscape, this research offers valuable insights for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers aiming to accelerate the transition to a sustainable energy future."}
