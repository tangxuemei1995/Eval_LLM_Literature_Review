{"Abstract": "This study examines sustainable intensification strategies for smallholder agricultural systems in the Global South, focusing on staple crops. The research synthesizes evidence on the effectiveness of improved cultivars, push-pull systems, and the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) in enhancing food production while maintaining environmental sustainability. Improved cultivars have shown potential in increasing yield resilience against climate variability, while push-pull systems offer integrated pest management solutions that reduce reliance on chemical inputs. SRI, with its emphasis on water management and plant spacing, has demonstrated significant yield improvements in rice cultivation. The analysis highlights the importance of context-specific adaptations and farmer participation in the successful implementation of these strategies. Challenges such as resource constraints, knowledge dissemination, and policy support are identified as critical factors influencing adoption rates. The findings underscore the need for collaborative efforts among stakeholders to optimize these strategies, ensuring food security and sustainable livelihoods for smallholder farmers."}
