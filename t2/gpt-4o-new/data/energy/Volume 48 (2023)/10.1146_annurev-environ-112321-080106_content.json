{"Abstract": "This paper explores recent advancements in qualitative methods within environmental research, emphasizing their critical role in understanding complex socioecological systems and addressing climate change challenges. Qualitative approaches, including participatory research, have gained prominence for their ability to capture diverse perspectives and contextual nuances often overlooked by quantitative methods. These methods facilitate deeper insights into human-environment interactions, enabling researchers to engage with local communities and stakeholders effectively. The paper reviews innovative applications of qualitative techniques, such as ethnography, narrative analysis, and participatory mapping, highlighting their contributions to environmental policy and practice. By integrating qualitative insights with quantitative data, researchers can develop more comprehensive and adaptive strategies for managing environmental issues. The study underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and methodological pluralism in advancing environmental research, advocating for a balanced approach that leverages the strengths of both qualitative and quantitative paradigms to address the multifaceted nature of environmental challenges."}
