{"Abstract": "The Anthropocene epoch is characterized by significant human impact on Earth's systems, with wildfires playing a critical role in shaping biodiversity and climate dynamics. This study explores the complex interplay between fire regimes and social-ecological systems, emphasizing the need for sustainable management practices. By analyzing historical and contemporary fire patterns, we assess their implications for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. Our findings highlight the dual role of wildfires as both a natural ecological process and a growing threat exacerbated by anthropogenic activities. We propose a framework for integrating fire management into broader sustainability strategies, considering the socio-economic and environmental dimensions of fire regimes. This approach aims to enhance resilience in ecosystems and human communities, fostering a more balanced coexistence with fire in the Anthropocene. Ultimately, understanding and adapting to fire regimes is crucial for maintaining Earth's biodiversity and achieving long-term sustainability goals in the face of climate change."}
