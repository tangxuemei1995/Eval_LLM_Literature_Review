{"Abstract": "The increasing impacts of climate change pose significant risks to coastal critical infrastructure, which is essential for economic stability, public safety, and environmental health. This study examines the vulnerabilities of such infrastructure to climate-induced hazards, including sea-level rise, storm surges, and extreme weather events. By analyzing current resilience strategies, the research identifies gaps in existing frameworks that fail to address the cascading nature of these hazards. The study employs a multi-disciplinary approach, integrating climate science, engineering, and socio-economic analysis to assess the potential for cascading failures that can amplify the impacts of initial disruptions. Findings suggest that traditional risk management practices are insufficient in the face of complex, interconnected threats posed by climate change. The research advocates for a paradigm shift towards adaptive, resilient infrastructure planning that incorporates dynamic risk assessments and cross-sector collaboration. By enhancing the resilience of coastal critical infrastructure, communities can better withstand and recover from climate-related disruptions, thereby safeguarding essential services and reducing long-term economic and social costs. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on climate resilience and offers actionable insights for policymakers and infrastructure planners."}
