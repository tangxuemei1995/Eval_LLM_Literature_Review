{"Abstract": "This study explores the development and application of metrics for decision-making in energy justice, focusing on energy equity. By integrating concepts of distributive, procedural, and recognition justice, the research aims to establish a comprehensive framework for evaluating energy policies and projects. The proposed metrics are designed to assess the equitable distribution of energy resources, ensure inclusive decision-making processes, and recognize diverse community needs and identities. Through case studies and empirical analysis, the study demonstrates how these metrics can guide policymakers in creating more just and sustainable energy systems. The findings highlight the importance of a multidimensional approach to energy justice, promoting fairness and inclusivity in the transition to renewable energy sources."}
