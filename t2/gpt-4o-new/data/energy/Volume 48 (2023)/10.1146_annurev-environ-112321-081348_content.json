{"Abstract": "The effectiveness of conservation efforts in protected areas (PAs) and Indigenous and locally managed areas (ILMAs) is increasingly recognized as being closely linked to governance structures. This study examines the relationship between governance models and conservation outcomes, focusing on biodiversity preservation, ecosystem services, and community well-being. By analyzing a diverse range of case studies from various geographical regions, this research identifies key governance attributes that contribute to successful conservation. These include inclusive decision-making processes, equitable benefit-sharing mechanisms, and adaptive management practices that incorporate traditional ecological knowledge. The findings suggest that governance systems that empower local communities and Indigenous peoples, while ensuring accountability and transparency, are more likely to achieve long-term conservation goals. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of legal frameworks and policy support in facilitating effective governance. Challenges such as conflicting land-use interests, inadequate funding, and political instability are also discussed, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches that align conservation objectives with socio-economic development. The research underscores the potential of ILMAs as complementary to traditional PAs, advocating for a paradigm shift towards more participatory and decentralized governance models. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on conservation governance, offering insights for policymakers, conservation practitioners, and Indigenous and local communities engaged in managing natural resources sustainably."}
