{"Abstract": "The concept of Great Green Walls has emerged as a prominent strategy for combating desertification and promoting environmental rehabilitation in arid regions. This study critically examines the scientific basis, practical implementation, and socio-environmental impacts of large-scale afforestation projects in areas such as the Sahel, Algeria, and China. By analyzing case studies and recent data, we assess the effectiveness of these initiatives in halting land degradation and restoring ecosystems. The research highlights the challenges of dryland afforestation, including water scarcity, soil suitability, and socio-economic factors. Furthermore, it explores the potential myths and misconceptions surrounding these projects, questioning whether they are sustainable solutions or merely symbolic gestures. Our findings suggest that while Great Green Walls hold promise, their success depends on integrating scientific insights with local knowledge and adaptive management practices. This study contributes to a nuanced understanding of afforestation as a tool for environmental and community resilience."}
