{"Abstract": "The pervasive presence of plastics in the environment has emerged as a critical global concern, with significant implications for ecosystems and human health. This study explores the multifaceted impact of plastic pollution, focusing on the prevalence and distribution of microplastics, the degradation of polymers, and the resultant chemical contamination. Plastics, due to their durability and widespread use, have become ubiquitous pollutants, persisting in terrestrial and aquatic environments. Microplastics, in particular, pose a unique threat due to their small size, which facilitates their ingestion by a wide range of organisms, leading to bioaccumulation and potential biomagnification in food webs. The degradation of larger plastic items into microplastics is accelerated by environmental factors such as UV radiation and mechanical abrasion, further exacerbating contamination levels. Additionally, plastics act as vectors for chemical pollutants, including additives and absorbed environmental toxins, which can leach into ecosystems, posing risks to wildlife and human populations. This research underscores the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to mitigate plastic pollution, including the development of biodegradable alternatives, improved waste management practices, and policies aimed at reducing plastic production and consumption. By advancing our understanding of the environmental dynamics of plastic pollutants, this study contributes to the broader discourse on sustainable environmental management and the protection of biodiversity and human health."}
