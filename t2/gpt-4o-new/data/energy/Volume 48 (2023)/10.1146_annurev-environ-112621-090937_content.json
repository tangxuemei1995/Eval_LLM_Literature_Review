{"Abstract": "Fungi, encompassing diverse groups such as Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, play crucial roles in ecosystems, yet their global diversity and distribution remain underexplored. This study synthesizes recent advancements in fungal biodiversity research, emphasizing the significance of early diverging fungi and endemic species. Utilizing innovative techniques like metabarcoding, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the fungus:plant ratio across various biomes, revealing patterns of fungal endemism and distribution. Our findings highlight the urgent need for conservation strategies, as many fungal species are not yet assessed for the IUCN Red List. We advocate for integrated conservation approaches, combining in situ and ex situ methods, to safeguard these vital organisms. This research underscores the importance of fungi in maintaining ecological balance and the necessity of expanding our understanding to inform global conservation efforts. By pushing the frontiers of biodiversity research, we aim to foster a deeper appreciation and protection of fungal diversity worldwide."}
