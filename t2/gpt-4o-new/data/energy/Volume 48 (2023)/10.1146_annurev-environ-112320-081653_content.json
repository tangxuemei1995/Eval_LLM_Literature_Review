{"Abstract": "Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (HCBs) pose significant ecological and public health risks in freshwater systems worldwide. These blooms are exacerbated by climate change and eutrophication, which enhance the growth conditions for cyanobacteria. Key biological traits, such as buoyancy regulation, nitrogen fixation, and toxin production, enable cyanobacteria to dominate aquatic ecosystems. Cyanotoxins, produced by these blooms, threaten water quality and aquatic life, posing risks to human health through water consumption and recreational exposure. Understanding the mechanisms driving HCBs is crucial for developing effective control strategies. Current approaches include nutrient management, biological control, and advanced water treatment technologies. However, the complexity of HCB dynamics necessitates integrated management strategies that consider local environmental conditions and socio-economic factors. This review synthesizes recent advances in HCB research, highlighting the need for interdisciplinary efforts to mitigate their impacts."}
