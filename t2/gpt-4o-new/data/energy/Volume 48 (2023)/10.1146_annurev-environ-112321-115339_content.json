{"Abstract": "In an era marked by increasing opinion polarization, understanding its impact on environmental decision-making is crucial. This study explores the dynamics of perceived polarization and its influence on intergroup relations within the context of climate change. By examining how polarized opinions shape environmental policies and individual behaviors, we aim to uncover the mechanisms that either hinder or facilitate consensus-building. Our research employs a mixed-methods approach, integrating quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews, to assess the extent to which perceived polarization affects stakeholders' willingness to engage in cooperative decision-making. Findings suggest that heightened perceived polarization exacerbates intergroup tensions, leading to reduced collaboration and suboptimal environmental outcomes. However, the study also identifies potential pathways for mitigating these effects, emphasizing the role of communication strategies and inclusive dialogue in fostering constructive intergroup interactions. This research contributes to the broader discourse on environmental governance, offering insights into navigating decision-making processes amidst societal divisions."}
