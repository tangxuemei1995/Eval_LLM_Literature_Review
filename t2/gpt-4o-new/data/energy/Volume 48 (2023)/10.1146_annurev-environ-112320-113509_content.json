{"Abstract": "This study explores the dynamics of collective action in the management of common-pool resources (CPRs), emphasizing the role of common property regimes and the practice of commoning. By examining various case studies across different geographical and cultural contexts, the research highlights the effectiveness of community-based governance structures in sustaining natural resources. The analysis delves into the principles of resource governance, identifying key factors that contribute to successful collective management, such as trust, communication, and adaptive strategies. Furthermore, the study addresses the challenges posed by external pressures, including market forces and policy interventions, which often threaten the sustainability of CPRs. The findings underscore the importance of integrating local knowledge and participatory approaches in natural resource policy to enhance resilience and equity. This research contributes to the broader discourse on sustainable development by advocating for policies that support community empowerment and the preservation of commons, ultimately fostering a more sustainable and equitable management of shared resources."}
