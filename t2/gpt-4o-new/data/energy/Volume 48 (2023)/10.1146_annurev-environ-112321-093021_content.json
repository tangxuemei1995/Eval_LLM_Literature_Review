{"Abstract": "Urban overheating, characterized by the urban heat island effect, poses significant challenges to cities worldwide. This phenomenon results from the replacement of natural landscapes with impervious surfaces, leading to increased temperatures in urban areas compared to their rural surroundings. The magnitude of urban overheating varies with geographic location, urban design, and local climate conditions, exacerbating heat-related health risks, energy consumption, and environmental degradation. This study explores the characteristics and impacts of urban overheating, emphasizing the need for effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. Mitigation efforts, such as increasing urban greenery, enhancing building materials, and implementing reflective surfaces, are crucial in reducing heat accumulation. Adaptation strategies, including urban planning and public health interventions, aim to enhance resilience against heat stress. Future challenges involve addressing the compounded effects of climate change, population growth, and urbanization, necessitating integrated approaches to manage urban heat sustainably. This research underscores the urgency of developing comprehensive policies to safeguard urban populations and ecosystems from the adverse effects of overheating."}
