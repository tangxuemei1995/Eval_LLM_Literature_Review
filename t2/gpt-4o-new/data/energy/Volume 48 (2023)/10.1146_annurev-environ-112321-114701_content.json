{"Abstract": "Groundwater serves as a critical source of drinking water for a significant portion of the global population, yet its quality is increasingly threatened by both geogenic and emerging contaminants. This study examines the impact of key substances such as arsenic, fluoride, and nitrates, alongside emerging contaminants like pharmaceuticals and personal care products, on human health. The research highlights the pathways through which these contaminants enter groundwater systems and their subsequent effects on public health, including potential chronic diseases and acute health issues. By integrating data from recent studies, this paper underscores the urgent need for sustainable groundwater management practices that prioritize the protection of water quality. It also discusses the role of advanced monitoring technologies and regulatory frameworks in mitigating contamination risks. The findings emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in addressing groundwater quality challenges, advocating for policies that balance human health needs with environmental sustainability. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between groundwater quality and public health, offering insights for future policy development and management strategies."}
