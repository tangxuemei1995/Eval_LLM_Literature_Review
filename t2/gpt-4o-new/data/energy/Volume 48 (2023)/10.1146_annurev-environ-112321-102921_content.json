{"Abstract": "The transition towards low energy demand futures in buildings is pivotal for climate change mitigation, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of current trends and future scenarios. This study examines the state of research on energy demand transformation in residential and commercial buildings, highlighting the role of megatrends such as urbanization, technological advancements, and policy shifts. By analyzing existing models and scenarios, we identify key drivers and barriers to achieving energy-efficient buildings that support decent living standards. The research underscores the importance of integrating socio-economic factors and technological innovations in scenario development to accurately predict future energy demands. Furthermore, it emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary approaches to address the complex interactions between energy systems and societal changes. Our findings suggest that while significant progress has been made, there are critical research gaps in understanding the long-term impacts of energy policies and the potential of emerging technologies. Addressing these gaps is essential for developing robust strategies to reduce energy consumption and enhance sustainability in the built environment."}
