{"Abstract": "The concept of deforestation-free commodity supply chains has gained significant attention as a potential solution to mitigate environmental degradation and promote sustainability. This study examines the effectiveness of current forest governance frameworks and policy mixes in achieving zero deforestation goals. By analyzing land use patterns and the implementation of sustainability initiatives, we assess whether these supply chains are a feasible reality or merely an aspirational myth. Our findings indicate that while progress has been made, significant challenges remain, including inadequate enforcement of policies, lack of transparency, and conflicting economic interests. The study highlights the need for a comprehensive approach that integrates robust governance, stakeholder collaboration, and innovative policy instruments to ensure the transition towards truly sustainable supply chains. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on balancing economic development with environmental conservation in global commodity markets."}
