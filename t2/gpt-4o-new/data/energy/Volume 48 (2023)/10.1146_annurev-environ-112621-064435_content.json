{"Abstract": "This study examines the current US legal and regulatory framework governing nuclear waste management, focusing on both existing and future reactors and their associated fuel cycles. It highlights the complexities of managing spent nuclear fuel, emphasizing the importance of retrievability and long-term storage solutions. The analysis delves into the Standard Contract's role in shaping obligations and responsibilities for nuclear waste disposal. Additionally, the paper explores regulatory adaptations necessary to accommodate advanced reactor technologies and innovative fuel cycles. By evaluating existing policies and identifying potential gaps, this research aims to inform future legislative and regulatory developments, ensuring safe and efficient nuclear waste management. The findings underscore the need for a dynamic framework that can adapt to technological advancements while maintaining stringent safety and environmental standards."}
