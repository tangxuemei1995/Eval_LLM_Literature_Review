{"Abstract": "Soils play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, acting as both carbon stores and sinks, with significant implications for climate change mitigation and adaptation. This study explores the expectations, patterns, processes, and prospects of soil carbon transitions, utilizing models such as the Century and Millennial models to simulate carbon dynamics. Key processes such as decomposition, litter input, and root turnover are examined to understand their impact on soil carbon sequestration. The research highlights the importance of soil health and accurate soil mapping in enhancing carbon storage capabilities. By integrating climate policy considerations, the study underscores the potential of soils in mitigating climate change effects. The findings suggest that strategic management of soil resources can enhance their role as carbon sinks, offering a viable pathway for climate change adaptation and mitigation. This research provides a comprehensive framework for policymakers and land managers to optimize soil carbon storage in the face of global climate challenges."}
