{"Abstract": "Over the past thirty years, climate mitigation policies have evolved significantly, driven by the urgent need to address global climate change. This literature review critically examines the effectiveness of various policy instruments implemented worldwide to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The study categorizes these instruments into regulatory approaches, market-based mechanisms, and voluntary agreements, assessing their impact on emission abatement and overall policy effectiveness. Regulatory approaches, such as emission standards and mandates, have shown mixed results, often limited by enforcement challenges and economic trade-offs. Market-based mechanisms, including carbon pricing and cap-and-trade systems, have gained prominence for their cost-effectiveness and flexibility, yet their success is contingent on robust market design and political support. Voluntary agreements, while fostering stakeholder engagement, frequently suffer from insufficient ambition and lack of accountability. The review highlights that the integration of multiple policy instruments often yields better outcomes, leveraging the strengths of each approach while mitigating their weaknesses. Furthermore, the analysis underscores the importance of adaptive policy frameworks that can respond to evolving scientific insights and socio-economic contexts. Despite notable progress in some regions, the global mitigation efforts remain insufficient to meet the targets set by international agreements such as the Paris Accord. The study calls for enhanced international cooperation, increased investment in clean technologies, and the alignment of climate policies with broader socio-economic goals to achieve meaningful emission reductions. By synthesizing three decades of policy experiences, this review provides valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders aiming to design more effective climate mitigation strategies in the future."}
