{"Abstract": "The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events have raised significant concerns about their linkage to climate change. This study delves into the attribution of extreme events to anthropogenic climate change, aiming to enhance our understanding of climate vulnerability and inform adaptive strategies. By employing advanced statistical models and climate simulations, we assess the extent to which human-induced climate change has influenced the occurrence and severity of recent extreme events, such as heatwaves, floods, and hurricanes. Our findings indicate a discernible human fingerprint in the increased likelihood and intensity of these events, underscoring the critical role of greenhouse gas emissions in altering climate patterns. The research highlights the importance of robust attribution studies in identifying regions and populations most vulnerable to climate impacts, thereby guiding policymakers in prioritizing mitigation and adaptation efforts. Furthermore, the study emphasizes the need for improved climate models and observational data to refine attribution techniques and enhance predictive capabilities. As climate change continues to pose significant risks to global ecosystems and human societies, understanding the attribution of extreme events is crucial for developing effective responses and fostering resilience in the face of an uncertain climate future."}
