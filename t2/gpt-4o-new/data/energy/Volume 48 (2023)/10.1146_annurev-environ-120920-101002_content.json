{"Abstract": "The transition to green technologies presents both opportunities and challenges for achieving environmental justice. This study explores the implications of electrification, modal shift, and sustainable buildings on distributional justice within the framework of a just transition. Electrification, while reducing carbon emissions, may exacerbate existing inequalities if access to clean energy is unevenly distributed. Similarly, modal shifts in transportation, such as increased reliance on public transit, require careful planning to ensure equitable access across diverse communities. Sustainable building practices offer significant potential for reducing environmental impact, yet they must be implemented in ways that do not disproportionately burden marginalized groups. This research highlights the need for policies that prioritize equitable distribution of benefits and burdens associated with green technologies. By integrating principles of distributional justice, policymakers can ensure that the transition to a sustainable future is inclusive and fair, thereby advancing both environmental and social objectives."}
