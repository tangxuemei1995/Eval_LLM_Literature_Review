{"Abstract": "The legitimacy of science is a critical factor in shaping public policy and cultural discourse, particularly in an era marked by increasing polarization. This study examines the multifaceted nature of scientific legitimacy, exploring how it is constructed, perceived, and challenged within contemporary society. By analyzing the interplay between scientific knowledge and cultural values, the research highlights the tensions that arise when scientific consensus confronts diverse ideological beliefs. The paper delves into the mechanisms through which science gains or loses legitimacy, including the role of media, political influence, and public engagement. It also considers the implications of these dynamics for policy-making, emphasizing the need for strategies that enhance the credibility and acceptance of scientific findings. Through a comprehensive review of literature and case studies, the study provides insights into how science can maintain its authoritative role in informing policy decisions amidst cultural and ideological divides. Ultimately, the research underscores the importance of fostering a dialogue that bridges the gap between scientific communities and the broader public to sustain the legitimacy of science in society."}
