{"Abstract": "This study explores the social construction of age, emphasizing its dynamic nature across the life course and its intersection with various social stratifications. By integrating intersectionality into the analysis, the research highlights how age interacts with other social categories such as gender, race, and class, influencing individual experiences and societal expectations. Methodologically, the study critiques traditional demographic approaches to measuring age, advocating for more nuanced and context-sensitive tools that capture the complexity of aging processes. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical data, the research underscores the importance of understanding age not merely as a biological marker but as a socially constructed phenomenon that shapes and is shaped by cultural, economic, and political forces. The findings call for a re-evaluation of age-related policies and practices, promoting a more inclusive and equitable approach to aging in diverse societies."}
