{"Abstract": "This study delves into Critical Race Theory (CRT) as a framework for examining and challenging the pervasive influence of white privilege and whiteness in contemporary society. By critically analyzing the historical and socio-political constructs that sustain racial hierarchies, this research highlights the systemic nature of racial inequities. It explores how CRT provides a lens to confront and rethink the entrenched norms that privilege whiteness, thereby perpetuating racial disparities. Through a synthesis of theoretical insights and empirical evidence, the study underscores the necessity of re-evaluating institutional practices and cultural narratives that uphold white dominance. Ultimately, this research advocates for transformative approaches that foster racial equity and justice, urging a reimagining of societal structures to dismantle the privileges associated with whiteness."}
