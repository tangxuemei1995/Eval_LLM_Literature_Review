{"Abstract": "This study introduces a novel framework for examining the intertwined social contexts of neighborhoods and schools, emphasizing their combined impact on individual outcomes. Traditional research often isolates neighborhood effects from school effects, potentially overlooking the complex interactions between these environments. By integrating data on neighborhood demographics, school resources, and segregation patterns, this approach provides a comprehensive analysis of how these contexts jointly influence educational and social outcomes. The study employs advanced statistical models to assess the relative contributions of neighborhood and school characteristics, revealing significant interactions that suggest a need for policies addressing both domains simultaneously. Findings indicate that segregation within and between neighborhoods and schools exacerbates inequalities, underscoring the importance of coordinated interventions. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of social contexts, offering insights for educators, policymakers, and community leaders aiming to foster equitable environments for youth development."}
