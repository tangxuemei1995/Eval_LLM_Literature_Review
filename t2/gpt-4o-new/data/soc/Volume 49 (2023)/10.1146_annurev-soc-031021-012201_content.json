{"Abstract": "This study explores the social implications of supply-side decarbonization, a critical strategy in mitigating climate change. By focusing on energy production and its transition towards low-carbon alternatives, the research examines the socio-economic effects on communities dependent on fossil fuel industries. The analysis highlights the importance of a just transition, ensuring that policies not only reduce carbon emissions but also address potential inequalities and job displacements. Through a review of current policy frameworks and case studies, the study identifies best practices for integrating social considerations into decarbonization efforts. The findings suggest that successful supply-side decarbonization requires comprehensive policy measures that support workforce retraining, community engagement, and equitable resource distribution. This research contributes to the broader discourse on sustainable energy transitions, emphasizing the need for inclusive strategies that balance environmental goals with social equity. The study underscores the role of policy in facilitating a fair and effective transition to a low-carbon economy."}
