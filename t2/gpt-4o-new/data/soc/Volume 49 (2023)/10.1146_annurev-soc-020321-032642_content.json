{"Abstract": "This study explores the concept of 'diverging destinies' within the context of East Asia, focusing on the implications for family structures, children, and gender inequality. As East Asian societies undergo rapid economic and social transformations, disparities in family dynamics and child outcomes have become increasingly pronounced. The research examines how these changes contribute to widening inequalities, particularly in terms of gender roles and opportunities. By analyzing demographic data and policy developments across several East Asian countries, the study highlights the complex interplay between traditional cultural norms and modern economic pressures. The findings suggest that while some families benefit from enhanced educational and economic opportunities, others face significant challenges, exacerbating social stratification. This divergence has profound implications for future generations, potentially entrenching gender disparities and limiting social mobility. The study calls for targeted policy interventions to address these inequalities and promote more equitable family and child outcomes in the region."}
