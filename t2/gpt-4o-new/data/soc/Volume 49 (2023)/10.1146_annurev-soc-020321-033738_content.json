{"Abstract": "Ethnomethodology, since its inception by Harold Garfinkel, has profoundly influenced the study of social interactions, particularly through its focus on the methods and practices individuals use to construct and understand their social worlds. This paper explores the legacies and future prospects of ethnomethodology, emphasizing its impact on conversation analysis, studies of science, organizational research, and workplace studies. Ethnomethodology's distinctive approach to social inquiry, which prioritizes the detailed examination of everyday interactions, has provided valuable insights into the tacit rules and instructed actions that underpin social order. By examining the mundane activities of individuals, ethnomethodologists have revealed the complex, yet often invisible, structures that govern social life. The paper highlights key contributions of ethnomethodology to the understanding of scientific practices, illustrating how scientific knowledge is constructed through routine interactions and negotiations. In organizational contexts, ethnomethodology has shed light on the informal practices and rules that shape workplace dynamics, offering a nuanced perspective on organizational behavior. Furthermore, the paper discusses the methodological innovations introduced by ethnomethodology, such as the use of naturalistic data and the focus on participants' perspectives, which have enriched qualitative research methodologies. Looking forward, the paper identifies emerging areas of interest, including the integration of digital technologies in social interactions and the global dissemination of ethnomethodological approaches. By reflecting on its past achievements and future directions, this paper underscores ethnomethodology's enduring relevance and potential to contribute to a deeper understanding of social phenomena in an increasingly complex world."}
