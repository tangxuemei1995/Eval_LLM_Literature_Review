{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between food systems and social inequality, emphasizing the roles of agriculture, food access, and food justice. By employing an intersectional framework, the research examines how various social identities and power structures intersect to influence food sovereignty and access. The analysis highlights the disparities in food availability and quality experienced by marginalized communities, often exacerbated by systemic inequities in agricultural practices and policies. The concept of food justice is scrutinized as a means to address these disparities, advocating for equitable distribution of resources and empowerment of disenfranchised groups. Furthermore, the study delves into the potential of food sovereignty as a transformative approach to reclaim control over food systems, promoting sustainable and culturally appropriate food production. The findings underscore the necessity of integrating intersectional perspectives in policy-making to foster a more equitable and just food system, ultimately contributing to the reduction of social and economic inequalities."}
