{"Abstract": "This study explores the evolving conceptualizations of LGBTQ+ identities, emphasizing the intersectionality of sexual and gender identities across the life course. By examining the diverse experiences of sexual minorities, the research highlights the fluidity and complexity inherent in LGBTQ+ identities, challenging traditional binary frameworks. The study employs a multidisciplinary approach, integrating insights from sociology, psychology, and gender studies to understand how these identities are shaped by cultural, social, and historical contexts. Findings suggest that intersectional factors such as race, class, and age significantly influence the lived experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals, necessitating a more inclusive and nuanced understanding of sexual and gender identities. This research contributes to the broader discourse on identity formation and the need for policies that recognize and support the diverse realities of LGBTQ+ communities."}
