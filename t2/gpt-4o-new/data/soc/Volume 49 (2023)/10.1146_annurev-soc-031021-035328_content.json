{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between spatial contexts and the functioning of the criminal legal system, focusing on policing and punishment practices. By employing spatial-contextual analyses, the research examines how geographical and social environments influence law enforcement strategies and judicial outcomes. The study highlights the role of place in shaping policing patterns, revealing disparities in law enforcement intensity and punitive measures across different neighborhoods. It also investigates the impact of spatial factors on the distribution of criminal justice resources and the implications for community safety and equity. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical data, the research underscores the necessity of integrating spatial considerations into policy-making to address systemic biases and enhance the effectiveness of the criminal legal system. The findings advocate for a more nuanced understanding of place-based dynamics in shaping justice outcomes."}
