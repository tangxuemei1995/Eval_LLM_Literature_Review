{"Abstract": "This paper traces a 60-year intellectual journey through the evolving landscape of comparative political economy, focusing on key concepts such as embedded autonomy, dependent development, and state-society synergy. It examines the role of the developmental state in fostering economic growth and social transformation, while also addressing the challenges posed by globalization. The study highlights the emergence of counter-hegemonic globalization, emphasizing the significance of transnational advocacy networks in reshaping global power dynamics. Through an autobiographical lens, the author reflects on the theoretical and empirical contributions that have shaped the field, offering insights into the interplay between state structures and societal forces. By integrating historical analysis with contemporary debates, this work provides a comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions that define political and economic development across diverse contexts. The paper ultimately calls for a renewed focus on collaborative strategies to address global inequalities and promote sustainable development."}
