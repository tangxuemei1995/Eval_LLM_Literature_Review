{"Abstract": "This study examines the pervasive social inequalities within the high-tech industry, focusing on how gender, race, and ethnicity shape organizational dynamics and opportunities. Despite the industry's reputation for innovation and meritocracy, systemic biases persist, influencing hiring practices, career advancement, and access to venture capital. Through a comprehensive analysis of workplace structures and cultural norms, this research highlights the underrepresentation and marginalization of women and minority groups in tech roles and leadership positions. The study also explores the impact of these disparities on organizational performance and innovation. By integrating quantitative data with qualitative insights, the research underscores the need for more inclusive policies and practices to foster diversity and equity. The findings aim to inform stakeholders, including policymakers and industry leaders, about the critical importance of addressing these inequalities to enhance the industry's growth and societal impact."}
