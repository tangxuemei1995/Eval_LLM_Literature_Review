{"Abstract": "This study examines the multifaceted issue of land inequalities in the United States, focusing on the intersections of property rights, economic disparities, and environmental impacts. By analyzing both urban and rural contexts, the research highlights how historical and contemporary legal frameworks have shaped land distribution and access. The investigation reveals that economic policies and legal structures disproportionately favor certain demographics, exacerbating socio-economic divides. Urban areas exhibit pronounced disparities in property ownership, influenced by zoning laws and market dynamics, while rural regions face challenges related to agricultural land use and environmental sustainability. The study underscores the need for policy reforms that address these inequalities, promoting equitable land distribution and sustainable development. By integrating economic, legal, and environmental perspectives, this research contributes to a comprehensive understanding of land inequality, offering insights for policymakers and stakeholders aiming to foster a more equitable and sustainable land management system in the United States."}
