{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate dynamics of diasporic mobilization and state responses within the context of cross-border politics. By examining the transnational activities of diaspora communities, the research highlights how these groups influence geopolitical landscapes and contribute to the reconfiguration of national identities. The analysis focuses on the dual role of diasporas as both agents of change and subjects of state control, emphasizing the complex interplay between emigrant politics and homeland nationalism. Through a comparative approach, the study investigates various case studies where diasporic communities have actively engaged in political processes, either supporting or challenging their countries of origin. The findings reveal that state responses to diasporic mobilization are shaped by a combination of strategic interests, historical ties, and contemporary geopolitical considerations. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of transnationalism in shaping modern political landscapes and the evolving nature of state-diaspora relations."}
