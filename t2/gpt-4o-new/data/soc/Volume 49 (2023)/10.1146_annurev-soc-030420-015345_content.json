{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in causal inference and machine learning have significantly enhanced our ability to understand complex systems and predict outcomes. This paper reviews the integration of causal inference methodologies with machine learning techniques, focusing on key areas such as counterfactual analysis, treatment effect heterogeneity, and mediation analysis. By leveraging machine learning, researchers can now better estimate causal effects and explore treatment effect heterogeneity across diverse populations, improving the precision of policy interventions. Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges of extrapolation and external validity, emphasizing the importance of robust methodologies to ensure that causal findings are applicable beyond the studied sample. The synthesis of these fields promises to refine our understanding of causal mechanisms and improve decision-making processes across various domains. This review highlights the potential of these interdisciplinary approaches to address complex causal questions, paving the way for more accurate and generalizable insights in scientific research."}
