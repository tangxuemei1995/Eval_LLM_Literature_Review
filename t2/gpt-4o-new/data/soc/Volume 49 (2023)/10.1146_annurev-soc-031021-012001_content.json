{"Abstract": "Social isolation is increasingly recognized as a significant public health concern, with its impacts unequally distributed across various demographic groups. This study examines the disparities in social isolation across the life course, focusing on intersections of gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and socioeconomic status. Utilizing a comprehensive review of existing literature, the research highlights how marginalized groups experience heightened vulnerability to social isolation due to systemic inequalities and social determinants of health. The findings suggest that women, racial and ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and those with lower socioeconomic status are disproportionately affected, leading to adverse health outcomes. The study underscores the need for targeted interventions and policies that address these disparities, promoting social connectivity and inclusivity. By understanding the complex interplay of these factors, policymakers and health practitioners can better mitigate the health hazards associated with social isolation, fostering a more equitable society."}
