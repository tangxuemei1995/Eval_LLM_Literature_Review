{"Abstract": "This study explores gender disparities in negotiation outcomes and evaluates the effectiveness of various interventions aimed at reducing these gaps. Despite increasing awareness of gender inequality in professional settings, women often face challenges in negotiation, leading to disparities in salary and career advancement. The research examines interventions such as negotiation training programs, 'lean in' strategies, and policy measures like salary history bans and transparency mandates. By analyzing empirical data from diverse organizational contexts, the study assesses the impact of these interventions on negotiation success rates for women. Findings suggest that while negotiation training and 'lean in' strategies can enhance individual skills, systemic changes like salary history bans and transparency policies are more effective in leveling the playing field. The study concludes that a combination of personal empowerment and structural reforms is necessary to address gender disparities in negotiation outcomes comprehensively."}
