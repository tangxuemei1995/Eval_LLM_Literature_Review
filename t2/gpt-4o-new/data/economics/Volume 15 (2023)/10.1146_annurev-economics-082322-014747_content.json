{"Abstract": "This study examines the dynamics of corporate taxation, focusing on tax incidence and its implications for multinational companies, particularly during economic crises. By analyzing tax policies and their impact on corporate behavior, the research highlights how economic downturns influence tax strategies and compliance. The findings suggest that multinational companies often adjust their tax planning to mitigate financial pressures, affecting global tax revenues. This paper contributes to understanding the complex interplay between corporate taxation and economic stability, offering insights for policymakers aiming to enhance tax systems' resilience."}
