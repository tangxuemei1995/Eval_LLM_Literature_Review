{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of local projections in applied economics, emphasizing their advantages over traditional vector autoregressions (VARs). Local projections offer a flexible framework for estimating impulse response functions, particularly in the presence of non-linearities and structural breaks. By integrating panel data, this approach enhances the robustness of causal inference, aligning closely with the potential outcomes framework. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of local projections through empirical examples, highlighting their ability to accommodate heterogeneous effects across different economic contexts. This methodology provides a valuable tool for economists seeking to derive more accurate and interpretable insights from complex economic data."}
