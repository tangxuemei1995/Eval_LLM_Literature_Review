{"Abstract": "Tropical deforestation represents a critical challenge at the intersection of environmental degradation and economic development. This study explores the economic drivers and consequences of deforestation in tropical regions, emphasizing the intricate balance between land use change and sustainable resource management. Utilizing remote sensing data, the research quantifies deforestation rates and correlates them with economic activities, such as agriculture and logging, which often prioritize short-term gains over long-term ecological stability. The analysis highlights the externalities associated with deforestation, including biodiversity loss and climate change, and examines the role of common-property resources in exacerbating these issues. Furthermore, the study delves into the political economy of deforestation, identifying how governance structures and policy frameworks can either mitigate or exacerbate environmental degradation. By integrating environmental economics with natural resource management strategies, the research proposes policy interventions aimed at reducing deforestation while promoting economic development. The findings underscore the necessity for international cooperation and innovative economic incentives to preserve tropical forests, thereby safeguarding biodiversity and mitigating climate change impacts."}
