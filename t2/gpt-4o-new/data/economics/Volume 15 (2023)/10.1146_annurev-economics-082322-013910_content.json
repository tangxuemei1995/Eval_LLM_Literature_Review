{"Abstract": "This paper provides a comprehensive exploration of non-CES (Constant Elasticity of Substitution) aggregators, focusing on their role in economic modeling where traditional CES assumptions do not hold. We delve into the implications of nonhomothetic preferences and constant returns to scale (CRS) production functions, highlighting how these factors influence the behavior of aggregators. The study examines the concept of implicit additivity and its impact on the substitutability and complementarity of goods, distinguishing between gross substitutes and gross complements. Furthermore, the paper categorizes goods into essentials and inessentials, analyzing how these classifications affect consumer choice and market dynamics. By offering a guided tour through the theoretical landscape of non-CES aggregators, this research aims to enhance understanding of their application in diverse economic contexts, providing insights into more accurate modeling of real-world economic phenomena where traditional CES models may fall short."}
