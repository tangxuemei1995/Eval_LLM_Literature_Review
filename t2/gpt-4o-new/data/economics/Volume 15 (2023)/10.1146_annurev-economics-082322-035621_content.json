{"Abstract": "In the twenty-first century, labor market insurance policies have evolved to address the dynamic challenges posed by globalization, technological advancements, and economic fluctuations. This study examines the effectiveness and adaptability of partial unemployment insurance, wage insurance, and short-time work schemes as pivotal components of modern labor market strategies. Partial unemployment insurance provides financial support to workers experiencing reduced hours, thereby maintaining their attachment to the labor force. Wage insurance offers compensation for workers transitioning to lower-paying jobs, facilitating labor mobility and skill adaptation. Short-time work schemes, on the other hand, enable employers to retain skilled workers during economic downturns by reducing working hours instead of resorting to layoffs. Through a comparative analysis of these policies across different economies, this research highlights their role in mitigating income loss, preserving employment relationships, and promoting economic resilience. The findings underscore the necessity for policymakers to tailor these instruments to specific labor market conditions, ensuring they effectively support workers and employers in an ever-evolving economic landscape."}
