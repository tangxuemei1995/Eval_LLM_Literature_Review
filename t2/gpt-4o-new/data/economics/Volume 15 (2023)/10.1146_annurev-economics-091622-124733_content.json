{"Abstract": "This study explores cognitive limitations in contingent thinking, focusing on the sure-thing principle within cognitive economics. Through behavioral experiments, we examine how individuals deviate from rational decision-making due to cognitive constraints. Our findings reveal systematic failures in applying contingent reasoning, challenging traditional economic models. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive limitations, offering implications for refining behavioral theories and enhancing decision-making frameworks in economic contexts."}
