{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate dynamics between micro propagation and macro aggregation within production networks, focusing on the implications for aggregate productivity and resource misallocation. By examining the propagation of shocks through interconnected firms, we identify how micro-level disturbances can lead to significant macroeconomic fluctuations. The research highlights the role of production networks in facilitating comovement across sectors, thereby influencing aggregate productivity. Utilizing a novel analytical framework, we quantify the extent of misallocation and its impact on overall economic performance. Our findings suggest that optimizing network structures can mitigate adverse effects and enhance productivity. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving economic comovement and offers insights into policy measures that can improve resource allocation efficiency in complex production systems."}
