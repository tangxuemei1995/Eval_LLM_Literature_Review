{"Abstract": "This study examines the regulatory frameworks addressing collusion, focusing on the implications of the Twombly decision on the burden of proof. It explores the development of 'safe tests' to identify collusive behavior and the role of consent orders in enforcement. The integration of artificial intelligence in detecting and regulating collusion is also analyzed, highlighting its potential to enhance regulatory efficiency. The findings suggest that AI-driven tools can provide more precise and timely identification of collusion, thereby supporting more effective regulatory interventions."}
