{"Abstract": "This study examines the intricate dynamics between non-bank financial intermediation and emerging market vulnerabilities in the context of global risk fluctuations. With a focus on investment funds and their role in international capital flows, the research highlights how benchmark investing practices can amplify the transmission of global risk shocks to emerging markets. The analysis reveals that non-bank financial entities, particularly investment funds, significantly influence the volatility and resilience of emerging markets by altering capital flow patterns in response to global risk perceptions. The study further explores the concept of tail risk, emphasizing its critical impact on financial stability in these markets. By employing a comprehensive dataset and advanced econometric techniques, the findings underscore the necessity for enhanced regulatory frameworks to mitigate systemic risks associated with non-bank financial intermediation. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness between global financial systems and emerging market economies, offering insights for policymakers and investors."}
