{"Abstract": "This study explores the econometrics of nonlinear budget sets, focusing on the application of random utility models and budget set regression techniques. We examine the phenomenon of bunching, where individuals cluster at certain points in the budget set due to nonlinearities, and employ instrumental variables to address endogeneity issues. Our analysis provides insights into consumer behavior under complex budget constraints, offering a robust framework for empirical investigation. By integrating theoretical and empirical approaches, we enhance the understanding of decision-making processes in the presence of nonlinear budget sets, contributing to the broader field of econometric analysis and policy evaluation."}
