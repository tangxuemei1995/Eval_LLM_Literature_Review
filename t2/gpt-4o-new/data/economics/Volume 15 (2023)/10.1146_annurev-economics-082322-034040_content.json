{"Abstract": "The implementation of border carbon adjustments (BCAs) has emerged as a pivotal strategy in addressing carbon leakage and ensuring the effectiveness of domestic climate policies. This paper explores the economic rationale behind BCAs, which aim to level the playing field for domestic industries facing stringent carbon regulations by imposing tariffs on imports from countries with laxer environmental standards. By analyzing the potential impacts of BCAs, the study highlights their role in mitigating carbon leakage, promoting global emissions reductions, and incentivizing non-participating countries to adopt similar climate measures. Furthermore, the concept of a 'climate club' is examined as a cooperative framework to enhance the effectiveness of BCAs, fostering international collaboration and reducing trade tensions. The findings suggest that while BCAs can drive significant environmental benefits, careful design and international coordination are crucial to minimizing adverse economic impacts and ensuring equitable outcomes across global markets."}
