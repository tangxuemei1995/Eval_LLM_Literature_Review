{"Abstract": "This study examines the economic implications of antitrust reform, focusing on its impact on competition, monopoly power, and market efficiency. By analyzing historical and contemporary cases of antitrust enforcement, the research highlights the evolving nature of regulatory frameworks in response to changing market dynamics. The paper discusses the role of mergers and acquisitions in shaping competitive landscapes and evaluates the effectiveness of current antitrust policies in curbing monopolistic practices. Through a comprehensive review of economic theories and empirical evidence, the study identifies key challenges and opportunities for reforming antitrust regulations to foster innovation and consumer welfare. The findings suggest that a balanced approach, integrating both traditional and modern economic insights, is essential for designing effective antitrust policies that promote fair competition and prevent market concentration. This research contributes to the ongoing debate on optimizing regulatory strategies in increasingly complex global markets."}
