{"Abstract": "This study explores the pivotal role of parenting in fostering social mobility both within and across generations, emphasizing its impact on skill development and the reduction of inequality. By analyzing longitudinal data and employing a multidisciplinary approach, the research investigates how parenting practices influence the acquisition of cognitive and non-cognitive skills in children, which are critical for upward social mobility. The findings suggest that effective parenting strategies, characterized by supportive and nurturing environments, significantly enhance children's educational and occupational outcomes, thereby promoting intergenerational mobility. Furthermore, the study examines the transmission of social capital and values, highlighting how these elements contribute to breaking cycles of poverty and inequality. The research underscores the importance of policy interventions aimed at supporting parents, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, to equip them with the resources and knowledge necessary to foster their children's development. By addressing the disparities in parenting resources and opportunities, the study advocates for a more equitable society where social mobility is attainable for all, regardless of socioeconomic status. This research contributes to the broader discourse on human development by illustrating the transformative potential of parenting in shaping future generations and reducing social inequality."}
