{"Abstract": "The rapid advancement of digital technologies has significantly transformed the landscape of privacy, raising critical economic implications. This study explores the economics of digital privacy, focusing on the concept of data externalities and the role of privacy regulation. Data externalities arise when the collection and use of personal data by firms affect individuals who are not directly involved in the transaction, leading to potential market failures. The paper examines how these externalities can distort market outcomes and the efficiency of data-driven business models. Furthermore, it evaluates the effectiveness of current privacy regulations in mitigating these externalities and protecting consumer welfare. By analyzing various regulatory frameworks, the study highlights the trade-offs between innovation and privacy protection. The findings suggest that well-designed privacy regulations can enhance market efficiency by aligning incentives and reducing negative externalities, ultimately fostering a more balanced digital economy. Future research directions are proposed to further understand these dynamics."}
