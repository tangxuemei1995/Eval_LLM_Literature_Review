{"Abstract": "This study examines the intricate dynamics of USâ€“China trade relations, focusing on the implications of trade policy, the trade war, and the 'China shock' on US manufacturing employment. Utilizing a dynamic spatial economics framework, the research explores how input-output linkages have influenced the distributional effects of trade policies across different regions and sectors in the United States. The analysis reveals that the 'China shock' significantly disrupted US manufacturing employment, with pronounced regional disparities. The trade war, characterized by escalating tariffs, further complicated these dynamics, leading to both short-term disruptions and long-term strategic adjustments in supply chains. By integrating input-output linkages into the analysis, the study provides a nuanced understanding of how interconnected economic activities amplify or mitigate the impacts of trade policies. The findings underscore the importance of considering spatial and sectoral heterogeneity in formulating trade policies that aim to balance economic growth with equitable employment outcomes."}
