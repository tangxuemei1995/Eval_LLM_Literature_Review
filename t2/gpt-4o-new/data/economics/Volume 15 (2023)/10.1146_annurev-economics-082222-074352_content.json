{"Abstract": "This study explores the integration of advanced text algorithms in economic research, focusing on the application of topic models, word embeddings, and large language models, including transformer architectures. By leveraging 'text as data' methodologies, economists can extract nuanced insights from vast textual datasets, enhancing predictive accuracy and thematic analysis. The paper reviews recent advancements in these algorithms, highlighting their potential to revolutionize economic modeling and decision-making processes. It also discusses the challenges and opportunities presented by these technologies, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to fully harness their capabilities in economic contexts."}
