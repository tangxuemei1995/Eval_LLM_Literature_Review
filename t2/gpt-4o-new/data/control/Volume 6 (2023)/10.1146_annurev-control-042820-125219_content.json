{"Abstract": "This study explores the control mechanisms of multicarrier energy systems, emphasizing the transition from individual building management to broader network integration. By leveraging energy hubs, the research investigates the potential of distributed and cooperative control strategies to enhance system efficiency and reliability. Predictive control techniques are employed to anticipate energy demands and optimize resource allocation across interconnected networks. The findings suggest that integrating building-level energy control with network-wide strategies can significantly improve energy distribution and consumption. This approach not only enhances the operational flexibility of energy systems but also supports the transition towards more sustainable and resilient energy infrastructures. The study provides a comprehensive framework for implementing advanced control strategies in multicarrier energy systems, highlighting the benefits of cooperative and predictive methodologies."}
