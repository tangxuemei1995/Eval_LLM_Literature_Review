{"Abstract": "This paper aims to establish a theoretical foundation for policy optimization in the context of learning control policies, a critical component of reinforcement learning and feedback control synthesis. We explore the intersection of these domains, focusing on the development of robust algorithms that can efficiently optimize policies in dynamic and uncertain environments. By leveraging recent advances in reinforcement learning, we propose a novel framework that integrates policy gradient methods with control-theoretic principles to enhance stability and performance. Our approach addresses key challenges such as sample efficiency and convergence guarantees, providing a comprehensive analysis of the underlying mathematical structures. Through rigorous theoretical examination and empirical validation, we demonstrate the efficacy of our methods in various control tasks, highlighting their potential to improve decision-making processes in complex systems. This work not only contributes to the understanding of policy optimization but also paves the way for future research in designing adaptive and resilient control strategies. Our findings underscore the importance of a unified theoretical approach to advance the capabilities of learning-based control systems."}
