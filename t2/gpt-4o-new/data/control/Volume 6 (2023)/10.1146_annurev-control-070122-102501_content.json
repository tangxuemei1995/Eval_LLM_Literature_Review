{"Abstract": "The study of embodied communication in human–robot collaboration is gaining traction as robots become increasingly integrated into daily life and work environments. This research explores the dynamics of physical interaction between humans and assistive robots, emphasizing the role of embodied communication in enhancing collaborative efficiency and user experience. By analyzing various interaction scenarios, the study identifies key factors that influence successful communication, such as the robot's ability to interpret human gestures, postures, and tactile feedback. The findings suggest that effective embodied communication can significantly improve task performance and user satisfaction, particularly in assistive contexts where physical interaction is paramount. The research also highlights the importance of designing robots with advanced sensory and processing capabilities to facilitate intuitive and seamless interactions. This work contributes to the broader understanding of human–robot collaboration by providing insights into the mechanisms of physical communication and offering guidelines for the development of more responsive and adaptive robotic systems. Future research directions include exploring the impact of cultural and individual differences on embodied communication and further refining interaction models for diverse applications."}
