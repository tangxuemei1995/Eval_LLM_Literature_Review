{"Abstract": "This review provides a comprehensive examination of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, emphasizing their application in nonlinear state-space models for state estimation and system identification. SMC, often referred to as particle filtering, offers a robust framework for approximating posterior distributions in dynamic systems. The paper unifies various SMC approaches, highlighting their theoretical foundations and practical implementations. Key advancements in algorithmic efficiency and accuracy are discussed, alongside challenges such as sample degeneracy and computational complexity. By synthesizing recent developments, this review aims to guide researchers in selecting appropriate SMC techniques for diverse applications, ranging from signal processing to robotics. The discussion also explores future directions, including adaptive algorithms and integration with machine learning methodologies."}
