{"Abstract": "The increasing integration of renewable energy sources and power electronics in modern power systems has led to a significant reduction in system inertia, posing challenges for grid stability and control. This study explores advanced control strategies for low-inertia power systems, focusing on grid-forming control and dynamic virtual power plants. By leveraging power electronics control, these strategies aim to enhance system resilience and maintain frequency stability. The research investigates the dynamic interactions between grid-forming units and conventional generators, proposing novel control algorithms to optimize performance. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches in mitigating frequency deviations and improving overall system reliability. The findings contribute to the development of robust control frameworks essential for the transition towards sustainable and resilient power systems in the face of increasing renewable penetration."}
