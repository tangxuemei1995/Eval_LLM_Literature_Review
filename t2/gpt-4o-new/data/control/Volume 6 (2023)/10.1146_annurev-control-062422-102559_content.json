{"Abstract": "The burgeoning field of microrobotics has witnessed significant advancements, yet the manipulation and control of micro-scale entities remain challenging due to the dominance of surface forces over inertial forces at such scales. This study explores the potential of exploiting liquid surface tension and capillary forces to enhance micromanipulation techniques in microrobotics. By leveraging the inherent properties of surface tension, microrobots can achieve precise control and movement, facilitating tasks such as assembly, transport, and positioning of micro-objects. The research delves into the theoretical underpinnings of capillary interactions and their practical applications in microrobotic systems. Experimental setups demonstrate how microrobots can utilize surface tension to navigate complex environments, manipulate objects with high precision, and perform tasks that are otherwise challenging with traditional methods. The findings suggest that integrating surface tension-based strategies can significantly improve the efficiency and versatility of microrobots, opening new avenues for applications in biomedical engineering, micro-assembly, and environmental monitoring. This study not only highlights the potential of surface tension as a tool for microrobotic innovation but also sets the stage for future research into harnessing other micro-scale forces for advanced robotic functionalities."}
