{"Abstract": "This study explores the integration of robotics on spacecraft for enhanced in-orbit servicing capabilities. Focusing on manipulators, we address the challenges of control and trajectory tracking using dual quaternions to model dynamics and kinematics. Our approach improves precision in robotic movements, essential for tasks such as satellite repair and debris removal. By leveraging advanced control algorithms, we demonstrate significant improvements in the accuracy and efficiency of robotic operations in space environments. This research contributes to the development of autonomous systems capable of performing complex tasks in the challenging conditions of outer space."}
