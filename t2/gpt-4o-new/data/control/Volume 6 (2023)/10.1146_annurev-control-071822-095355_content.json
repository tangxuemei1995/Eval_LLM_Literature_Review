{"Abstract": "The CYBATHLON competition has emerged as a pivotal platform for advancing assistive technologies through its unique focus on user-centered design and real-world applicability. By challenging teams to develop devices that address daily-life obstacles faced by people with disabilities, the competition fosters innovation that prioritizes inclusivity and practical utility. This paper examines the impact of CYBATHLON on the evolution of assistive technologies, highlighting how the event encourages collaboration between engineers, designers, and end-users. The competition's emphasis on real-world scenarios ensures that the technologies developed are not only technically advanced but also tailored to the specific needs of users, promoting greater independence and quality of life. Through case studies and analysis of past competitions, this study underscores the role of CYBATHLON in driving technological advancements and fostering a more inclusive society, where assistive devices are seamlessly integrated into the daily lives of individuals with disabilities."}
