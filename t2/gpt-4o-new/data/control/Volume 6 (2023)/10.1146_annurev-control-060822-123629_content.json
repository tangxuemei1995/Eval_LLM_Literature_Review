{"Abstract": "This study delves into the modeling and control of multiagent systems, with a focus on crowd dynamics. By examining interacting agent systems, we explore the mean-field limit as a powerful tool for understanding the collective behavior of large populations of agents. The research highlights the importance of feedback control mechanisms in managing and directing the flow of autonomous vehicles within these systems. Through a combination of theoretical analysis and computational simulations, we demonstrate how feedback control can be effectively employed to enhance system stability and efficiency. The findings provide insights into optimizing the movement and coordination of autonomous vehicles, which are increasingly prevalent in modern transportation networks. This work contributes to the broader understanding of crowd dynamics and offers practical solutions for the control of complex multiagent systems, paving the way for advancements in autonomous vehicle technology and smart city infrastructure."}
