{"Abstract": "Soft robotics is an emerging field that focuses on the design and development of robots constructed from highly compliant materials, enabling them to perform tasks in unstructured environments with enhanced adaptability and safety. This overview examines the key components of soft robotics, including actuation, sensing, and control, which are crucial for achieving complex manipulation and locomotion. The integration of advanced materials and novel design principles allows for the creation of soft actuators that mimic biological systems, offering unique advantages in robotic interaction. Simulation and modeling play a pivotal role in predicting the behavior of soft robots, facilitating the optimization of their design and functionality. Machine learning techniques are increasingly employed to enhance the control strategies of soft robots, enabling them to learn from their environment and improve their performance over time. This paper also explores the challenges and future directions in the field, emphasizing the potential of soft robotics to revolutionize applications in healthcare, search and rescue, and human-robot interaction. The synergy between interdisciplinary approaches is essential for advancing the capabilities and applications of soft robotic systems."}
