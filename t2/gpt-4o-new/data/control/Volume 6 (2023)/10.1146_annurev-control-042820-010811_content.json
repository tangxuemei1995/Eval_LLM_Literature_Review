{"Abstract": "In the realm of networked control systems (NCS), the interplay between information and control is pivotal, especially under the constraints imposed by communication networks. This paper delves into the multifaceted role of information in the estimation and control of cyber-physical systems (CPS), where communication constraints pose significant challenges. We explore how decentralized inference can be optimized by leveraging timing information and event-triggered mechanisms to enhance system performance. The study highlights the importance of timing information as a critical component in the design of control strategies, enabling more efficient use of limited communication resources. Event triggering is examined as a method to reduce unnecessary data transmission, thereby conserving bandwidth and energy while maintaining system stability and performance. Through a comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate how these strategies can be integrated into NCS to achieve robust control and estimation despite the inherent limitations of networked environments. The findings underscore the necessity of a holistic approach that considers the intricate balance between information flow and control actions, paving the way for more resilient and efficient CPS. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on optimizing control under communication constraints, offering insights that are crucial for the development of next-generation networked systems."}
