{"Abstract": "Piezoelectric composites have emerged as versatile materials with significant potential across various applications, particularly in the field of ultrasound technology. These composites, which combine piezoelectric ceramics or single crystals with polymers, offer enhanced mechanical flexibility and improved acoustic impedance matching compared to traditional piezoelectric materials. The connectivity of the composite phases plays a crucial role in determining the overall piezoelectric performance, with different connectivity patterns offering tailored properties for specific applications. Recent advancements in the fabrication of piezoelectric composites have focused on optimizing the connectivity and phase distribution to maximize their electromechanical coupling efficiency. This paper reviews the current state of piezoelectric composites, highlighting the advantages of using single crystal and ceramic phases, and discusses their application in ultrasound transducers. The versatility of these materials positions them as key components in the development of next-generation piezoelectric devices."}
