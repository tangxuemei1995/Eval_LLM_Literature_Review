{"Abstract": "Extreme abnormal grain growth (EAGG) is a critical phenomenon influencing the microstructural evolution of polycrystalline materials, with significant implications for their mechanical properties. This study investigates the underlying mechanisms driving EAGG, focusing on the interplay between grain boundary energy, grain boundary mobility, and Zener pinning effects. By employing advanced computational models and experimental techniques, we elucidate how variations in these parameters can lead to distinct microstructural outcomes. Our findings reveal that high grain boundary mobility, coupled with low boundary energy, facilitates the rapid growth of select grains, while Zener pinning can effectively hinder this process by stabilizing smaller grains. The research highlights the importance of controlling these factors to tailor material properties through microstructural engineering. This work provides a comprehensive framework for predicting and managing EAGG in various materials, offering pathways to optimize their performance in industrial applications."}
