{"Abstract": "Dynamic in situ electron microscopy has emerged as a transformative tool in the study of single-atom catalysis, offering unprecedented insights into the real-time behavior of catalysts at the atomic level. This technique allows researchers to observe the dynamic processes and structural changes that occur during catalytic reactions, providing a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that drive catalytic activity and selectivity. By capturing live action images and videos, dynamic in situ microscopy enables the visualization of single atoms and their interactions with reactants, facilitating the identification of active sites and the elucidation of reaction pathways. This advancement not only enhances our fundamental understanding of catalysis but also informs the design of more efficient and sustainable catalysts. The integration of this cutting-edge technology into chemical research represents a significant leap forward, promising to accelerate the development of novel catalytic materials and processes."}
