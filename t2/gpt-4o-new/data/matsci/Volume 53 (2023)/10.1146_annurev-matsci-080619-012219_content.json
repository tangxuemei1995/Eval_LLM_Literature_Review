{"Abstract": "Ionic gating has emerged as a powerful technique for modulating the electronic and magnetic properties of various materials, including transition metal oxides, magnetic thin films, and van der Waals two-dimensional (2D) materials. By employing an ionic liquid or gel as a gate dielectric, this method allows for the precise control of carrier density and phase transitions, enabling the exploration of novel states of matter such as superconductivity and magnetism. Recent advancements have demonstrated the potential of ionic gating in tuning the properties of magnetic thin films, leading to significant implications for spintronic applications. Furthermore, the ability to dynamically alter the electronic states in 2D materials opens new avenues for the development of neuromorphic computing devices, where ionic gating can mimic synaptic plasticity. This review highlights the latest progress in ionic gating techniques, emphasizing their role in advancing our understanding of complex material systems and their potential for future technological innovations."}
