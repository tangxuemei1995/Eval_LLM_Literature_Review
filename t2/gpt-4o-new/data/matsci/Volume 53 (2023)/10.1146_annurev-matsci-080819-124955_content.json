{"Abstract": "Hydrous transition metal oxides (HTMOs) have emerged as promising materials for electrochemical energy and environmental applications due to their unique structural and electrochemical properties. The presence of structural water within these oxides plays a crucial role in enhancing their electrochemical performance, facilitating ion insertion and transport, and improving overall conductivity. This review explores the potential of HTMOs in energy storage and conversion technologies, such as batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells, highlighting their ability to achieve high energy densities and rapid charge-discharge cycles. Additionally, the environmental applications of HTMOs, including water splitting and pollutant degradation, are discussed, emphasizing their catalytic efficiency and stability. The interplay between the structural water and the transition metal oxide matrix is analyzed to understand the mechanisms driving these applications. By examining recent advancements and challenges in the synthesis and application of HTMOs, this study aims to provide insights into the development of next-generation materials for sustainable energy and environmental solutions."}
