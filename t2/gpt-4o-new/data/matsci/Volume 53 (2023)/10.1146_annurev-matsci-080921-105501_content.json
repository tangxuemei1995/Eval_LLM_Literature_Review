{"Abstract": "Polar metals, a class of materials that exhibit both metallic conductivity and polar structural distortions, challenge the conventional understanding of ferroelectricity, which typically requires insulating behavior. This study explores the fundamental principles underlying polar metals, focusing on their unique electronic and structural properties. The interplay between polarization and metallicity is examined, with particular attention to the role of improper ferroelectricity in stabilizing polar distortions in metallic systems. Perovskite structures are highlighted as promising candidates for polar metals due to their versatile chemistry and structural flexibility. The potential applications of polar metals in novel electronic devices, such as non-volatile memories and sensors, are discussed, emphasizing their ability to combine functionalities of both metals and ferroelectrics. This review aims to provide insights into the design and synthesis of new polar metal materials, paving the way for future technological advancements."}
