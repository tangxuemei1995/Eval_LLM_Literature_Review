{"Abstract": "Grain boundary migration is a critical phenomenon influencing the microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of polycrystalline materials. This study investigates the mechanisms driving grain boundary migration, focusing on its role in grain growth and the overall stability of microstructures. By employing advanced characterization techniques and computational modeling, we analyze the factors affecting migration, including temperature, impurity concentration, and applied stress. Our findings reveal that grain boundary mobility is significantly enhanced by elevated temperatures and reduced impurity levels, leading to accelerated grain growth. Additionally, the study highlights the anisotropic nature of grain boundary migration, which is influenced by the crystallographic orientation of adjacent grains. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of microstructural development in polycrystals, offering potential pathways for optimizing material properties through controlled grain boundary engineering. The results have implications for the design of materials with improved mechanical performance and durability in various industrial applications."}
