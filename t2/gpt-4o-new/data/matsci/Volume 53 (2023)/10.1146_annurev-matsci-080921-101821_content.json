{"Abstract": "The study of low-dimensional and confined ice has garnered significant interest due to its unique structural, optical, and mechanical properties, which differ markedly from bulk ice. This research explores the crystal growth and characterization of ice in low-dimensional environments, such as thin films and nanoconfined spaces. By employing advanced microscopy and spectroscopy techniques, we investigate the morphology and interface dynamics of these ice structures. Our findings reveal that confinement leads to altered hydrogen bonding networks, resulting in distinct phase transitions and stability ranges. The optical properties of confined ice, including refractive index and light scattering, are examined, highlighting potential applications in photonics and sensor technologies. Additionally, the mechanical properties, such as hardness and elasticity, are assessed, providing insights into the behavior of ice under nanoscale constraints. This study advances our understanding of ice's behavior in restricted geometries, with implications for fields ranging from climate science to material engineering."}
