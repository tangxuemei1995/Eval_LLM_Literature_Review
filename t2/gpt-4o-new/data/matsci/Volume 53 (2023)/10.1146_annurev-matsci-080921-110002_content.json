{"Abstract": "Noncentrosymmetric materials, characterized by the absence of inversion symmetry, exhibit unique properties that are pivotal for advanced technological applications. This study explores the design principles underlying these materials, focusing on their nonlinear optical responses, magnetism, and the emergence of skyrmions. The lack of centrosymmetry in these materials leads to enhanced second-order nonlinear optical effects, making them ideal candidates for photonic devices. Additionally, the interplay between electronic structure and magnetic properties in noncentrosymmetric systems facilitates the stabilization of skyrmions, which are topologically protected magnetic textures with potential applications in spintronics. The research delves into the electronic structure modifications that promote these phenomena, providing insights into the synthesis and optimization of noncentrosymmetric materials. By understanding the fundamental principles governing their behavior, this work aims to guide the development of materials with tailored properties for specific applications, thereby advancing the fields of optoelectronics and magnetic data storage."}
