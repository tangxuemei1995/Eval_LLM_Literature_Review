{"Abstract": "The integration of machine learning (ML) into materials science has the potential to revolutionize the discovery and design of new materials. Central to this integration is the development of effective representations of materials that can be utilized by ML algorithms. This study explores various approaches to feature engineering, focusing on the representation of crystal structures and their properties. We examine traditional descriptor-based methods alongside emerging generative models that automatically learn representations from raw data. By comparing these methodologies, we highlight the strengths and limitations of each in capturing the complex, multi-scale nature of materials. Our findings suggest that generative models, with their ability to uncover latent features, offer a promising avenue for advancing ML applications in materials science. This work underscores the importance of representation in enhancing the predictive power and generalizability of ML models, ultimately accelerating the pace of materials innovation."}
