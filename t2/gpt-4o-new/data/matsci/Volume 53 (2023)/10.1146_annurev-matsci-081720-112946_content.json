{"Abstract": "The development of tailor-made additives for melt-grown molecular crystals presents a promising avenue for enhancing the properties and functionalities of crystalline materials. This study explores the rationale behind the use of such additives, focusing on their impact on the crystallization process, particularly in the formation of spherulites and twisted crystals. By manipulating chirality and polarity, tailor-made additives can influence the nucleation and growth kinetics, leading to improved control over crystal morphology and size distribution. The ability to direct the assembly of molecular crystals through specific interactions offers potential applications in optoelectronics, pharmaceuticals, and materials science. However, the complexity of designing effective additives that can consistently yield desired outcomes poses significant challenges. This research critically evaluates the benefits and limitations of employing tailor-made additives, considering factors such as cost, scalability, and the potential for unintended effects on crystal properties. Through a comprehensive review of recent advancements and case studies, this paper aims to provide insights into the strategic design of additives that can optimize melt crystallization processes, ultimately contributing to the advancement of material science and engineering."}
