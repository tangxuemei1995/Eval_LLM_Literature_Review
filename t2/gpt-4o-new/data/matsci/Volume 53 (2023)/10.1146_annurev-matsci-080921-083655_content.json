{"Abstract": "The development of sustainable polymers from biological matter has gained significant attention as a response to environmental concerns and the depletion of fossil resources. This review highlights recent advancements in the synthesis and application of biopolymers and biocomposites derived from renewable resources. Emphasis is placed on the integration of these materials into cementitious matrices, enhancing the sustainability of construction materials. Innovations in processing techniques and the functionalization of biopolymers have led to improved mechanical properties and durability, making them viable alternatives to conventional polymers. The study also explores the life cycle assessment of these materials, underscoring their potential to reduce carbon footprints. By leveraging the inherent biodegradability and renewability of biological matter, this research contributes to the broader goal of achieving a circular economy in material science, promoting environmental sustainability and resource efficiency."}
