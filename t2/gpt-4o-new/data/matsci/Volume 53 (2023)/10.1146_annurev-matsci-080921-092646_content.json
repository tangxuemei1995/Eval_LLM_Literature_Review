{"Abstract": "Quantitative Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) has emerged as a pivotal tool in materials science, offering unparalleled insights into the structural and compositional properties of materials at the atomic scale. This paper reviews the advancements in STEM techniques, focusing on imaging, diffraction, spectroscopy, and tomography. By integrating quantitative analysis and simulation, STEM enables precise measurement of atomic positions, chemical compositions, and electronic structures. Recent developments in detector technology and data processing have enhanced the resolution and sensitivity of STEM, facilitating the study of complex materials systems. The application of STEM in imaging provides high-resolution visualization of atomic arrangements, while diffraction and spectroscopy offer detailed information on crystallography and elemental distribution. Tomography, combined with advanced reconstruction algorithms, allows for three-dimensional characterization of nanostructures. This comprehensive approach underscores the transformative impact of quantitative STEM in advancing materials research and development."}
