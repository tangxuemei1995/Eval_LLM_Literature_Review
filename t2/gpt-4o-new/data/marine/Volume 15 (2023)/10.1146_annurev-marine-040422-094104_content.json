{"Abstract": "Lipid biogeochemistry is a pivotal field that explores the roles and transformations of lipids in marine environments, offering insights into microbial oceanography and the broader biogeochemical cycles. Recent advancements in lipidomic techniques have revolutionized our understanding of lipid diversity and function, enabling detailed characterization of lipid profiles in complex environmental samples. This review highlights the integration of modern lipidomic approaches with meta-omics technologies, which has facilitated the identification of novel lipid biomarkers and elucidated the metabolic pathways of marine microorganisms. By combining high-resolution mass spectrometry with bioinformatics tools, researchers can now map lipid distributions and dynamics with unprecedented precision. These advancements have significant implications for understanding the ecological roles of lipids, their contribution to carbon cycling, and their potential as indicators of environmental change. Furthermore, the study underscores the importance of lipid geochemistry in reconstructing past oceanic conditions and predicting future trends. This synthesis of lipidomics and biogeochemistry not only enhances our comprehension of marine ecosystems but also informs strategies for monitoring and mitigating anthropogenic impacts on ocean health."}
