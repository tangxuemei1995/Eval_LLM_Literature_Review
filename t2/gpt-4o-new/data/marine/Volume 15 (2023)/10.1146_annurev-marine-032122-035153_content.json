{"Abstract": "The ocean's biological carbon pump plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle by facilitating the transfer of carbon from the surface to the deep ocean. This process is primarily driven by the production and downward flux of organic matter, including marine snow, fecal pellets, and other aggregates. The efficiency of carbon export is influenced by several biological factors, such as microbial degradation and zooplankton feeding, which can attenuate the flux of carbon as it descends through the water column. This review examines the mechanisms underlying carbon export from a biologist's perspective, focusing on the interactions between marine organisms and their environment. We explore how microbial communities contribute to the breakdown of organic matter, and how zooplankton feeding behaviors impact the formation and transformation of particulate organic carbon. Understanding these processes is essential for predicting changes in carbon sequestration in response to environmental shifts, thereby providing insights into the ocean's role in mitigating climate change."}
