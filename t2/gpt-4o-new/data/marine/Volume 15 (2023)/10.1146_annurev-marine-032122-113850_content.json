{"Abstract": "Ocean Carbon Dioxide Removal (OCDR) is emerging as a pivotal strategy in mitigating climate change, yet it presents complex sociotechnical challenges. This study explores the multifaceted considerations surrounding OCDR, focusing on climate finance, public perception, and environmental ethics. The integration of OCDR into climate finance mechanisms is critical, necessitating robust frameworks to ensure equitable and effective funding. Public perception plays a crucial role in the acceptance and implementation of OCDR technologies, influenced by awareness, trust, and perceived risks. Furthermore, environmental ethics demand a careful evaluation of the potential ecological impacts and moral responsibilities associated with altering marine ecosystems. This research underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to address these challenges, advocating for transparent stakeholder engagement and comprehensive policy development. By examining these sociotechnical dimensions, the study aims to contribute to a more informed and balanced discourse on the role of OCDR in global climate strategies."}
