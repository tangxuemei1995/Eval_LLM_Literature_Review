{"Abstract": "Coral reefs are dynamic ecosystems where microbial interactions with dissolved organic matter (DOM) play a pivotal role in maintaining ecosystem function and resilience. This study explores the complex relationships between coral reef microbiomes and DOM, emphasizing their influence on nutrient cycling and overall ecosystem health. As coral reefs face increasing threats from deoxygenation and climate change, understanding these interactions becomes crucial. Microbial communities metabolize DOM, facilitating nutrient recycling and supporting coral and algal growth. This process is essential for sustaining biodiversity and productivity in reef environments. The research highlights how shifts in DOM composition, driven by environmental stressors, can alter microbial community structure and function, potentially impacting reef resilience. By elucidating the mechanisms of microbial-DOM interactions, this study provides insights into the adaptive capacity of coral reefs, offering potential strategies for conservation and management in the face of global environmental changes."}
