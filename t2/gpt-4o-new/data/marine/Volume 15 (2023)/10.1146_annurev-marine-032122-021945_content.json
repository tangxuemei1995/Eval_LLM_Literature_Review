{"Abstract": "Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS) are critical oceanographic features that significantly influence marine biodiversity, fisheries, and global carbon cycles. This study examines the impacts of climate change on EBUS, focusing on alterations in upwelling intensity, frequency, and spatial distribution. Climate change is expected to modify wind patterns, ocean temperatures, and stratification, which are key drivers of upwelling processes. Our analysis synthesizes recent observational data and model projections to assess how these changes may affect nutrient dynamics, primary productivity, and ecosystem structure within EBUS. Results indicate a potential increase in upwelling intensity in some regions, driven by intensified alongshore winds, while other areas may experience reduced upwelling due to altered oceanic conditions. These shifts could lead to significant ecological and socio-economic consequences, including changes in fishery yields and biodiversity loss. The study underscores the need for adaptive management strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on these vital systems. Further research is essential to refine predictions and develop comprehensive conservation frameworks tailored to the unique challenges faced by EBUS."}
