{"Abstract": "The study of global Quaternary carbonate burial offers critical insights into the carbon cycle's response to glacial-interglacial dynamics. This research synthesizes proxy data and model-based reconstructions to evaluate the spatial and temporal patterns of marine carbonate deposition over the Quaternary period. By integrating sediment core analyses with advanced modeling techniques, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms driving carbonate burial and its feedbacks on atmospheric CO2 levels. Despite advancements in reconstructive methodologies, significant uncertainties persist, particularly concerning regional variations and the influence of ocean circulation changes. These uncertainties challenge our understanding of the carbon cycle's sensitivity to climatic shifts. Our findings underscore the necessity for improved proxy records and model refinements to better constrain carbonate burial rates and their implications for past and future climate scenarios. This work contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between marine carbonate systems and global climate regulation during the Quaternary."}
