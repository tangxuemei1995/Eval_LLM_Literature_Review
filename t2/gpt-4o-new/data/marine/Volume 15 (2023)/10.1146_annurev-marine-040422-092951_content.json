{"Abstract": "Marshes and mangroves, as integral components of tidal wetlands, play a crucial role in mitigating the impacts of cyclones and hurricanes on coastal regions. This study explores the effectiveness of these ecosystems as nature-based solutions for flood protection, comparing their performance to traditional coastal engineering approaches. By dissipating wave energy and stabilizing shorelines, marshes and mangroves reduce the severity of storm surges and coastal flooding. The research synthesizes data from recent storm events, highlighting case studies where these natural buffers have significantly minimized damage. Additionally, the study examines the ecological and economic benefits of preserving and restoring these habitats, emphasizing their role in enhancing biodiversity and supporting local communities. The findings advocate for the integration of marshes and mangroves into coastal management strategies, promoting sustainable and resilient coastal development. This research underscores the importance of leveraging natural systems to address the growing challenges posed by climate change and extreme weather events."}
