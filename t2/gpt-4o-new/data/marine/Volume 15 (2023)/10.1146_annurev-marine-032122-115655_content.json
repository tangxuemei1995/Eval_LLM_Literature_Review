{"Abstract": "The deep ocean's water column, a vast and largely unexplored environment, harbors a diverse array of prokaryotic life forms, including bacteria and archaea. This study delves into the microbial oceanography of these prokaryotes, examining their distribution, diversity, and metabolic activities. Utilizing advanced molecular techniques and in situ sampling, we reveal the complex ecological roles these microorganisms play in biogeochemical cycles. Our findings highlight the metabolic versatility of deep ocean prokaryotes, which thrive under extreme conditions of pressure, low temperature, and limited nutrient availability. The study underscores the significance of prokaryotic communities in carbon and nitrogen cycling, contributing to the ocean's overall productivity and resilience. Furthermore, the research provides insights into the evolutionary adaptations that enable these microorganisms to survive and function in such a challenging environment. This work not only enhances our understanding of deep-sea ecosystems but also informs broader ecological and evolutionary theories regarding life in extreme habitats."}
