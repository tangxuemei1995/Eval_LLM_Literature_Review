{"Abstract": "The study explores the profound human impacts on marine ecosystems through a comprehensive analysis of global fisheries, emphasizing the role of The Sea Around Us project in serving civil society. By integrating data science with global studies, the research highlights the critical contributions of both artisanal and subsistence fisheries alongside large-scale operations. The project provides open access to extensive datasets, enabling a nuanced understanding of fisheries' socio-economic and environmental dimensions. This approach facilitates informed decision-making and policy development aimed at sustainable ocean management. The findings underscore the necessity of balancing human needs with ecological preservation, advocating for enhanced collaboration between scientists, policymakers, and communities. By documenting the intricate interactions between human activities and marine environments, the study offers valuable insights into the sustainable stewardship of ocean resources in the twenty-first century, reinforcing the importance of open data in addressing global challenges."}
