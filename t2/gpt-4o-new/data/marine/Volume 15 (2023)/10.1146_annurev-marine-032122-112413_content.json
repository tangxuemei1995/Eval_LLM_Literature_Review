{"Abstract": "This study investigates the connectivity and flow dynamics between the Arctic and subpolar North Atlantic Oceans using nuclear reprocessing tracers, specifically iodine-129 (129I). The research employs a combination of observational data and numerical modeling to trace the pathways and transit time distributions of water masses. The findings reveal significant insights into the circulation patterns and exchange processes between these oceanic regions. The use of 129I as a tracer provides a unique perspective on the temporal and spatial variability of water mass movement, highlighting the influence of Arctic outflows on the North Atlantic's thermohaline circulation. The results underscore the importance of understanding these connections in the context of global climate change, as they play a crucial role in regulating heat and salinity distribution. This study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of oceanic circulation and its implications for climate dynamics, offering valuable data for future climate modeling and prediction efforts."}
