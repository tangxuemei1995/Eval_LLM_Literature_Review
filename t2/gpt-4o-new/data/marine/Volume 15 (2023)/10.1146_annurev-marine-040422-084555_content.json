{"Abstract": "Pacific decadal-scale variability (PDV) represents a critical component of the Earth's climate system, influencing global weather patterns and climate variability. This study synthesizes recent advances in understanding the modes and mechanisms driving PDV, with a focus on the Pacific Ocean's role in modulating climate variability over decadal timescales. The research highlights the complex interplay between oceanic and atmospheric processes, including ocean–atmosphere teleconnections and their interactions with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). By examining observational data and climate model simulations, the study identifies key modes of PDV, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), and explores their impacts on regional and global climate systems. The findings underscore the importance of PDV in modulating climate change signals and emphasize the need for improved predictive models to enhance our understanding of future climate scenarios. This research contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of PDV, offering insights into its potential implications for climate policy and adaptation strategies in the context of ongoing global climate change."}
