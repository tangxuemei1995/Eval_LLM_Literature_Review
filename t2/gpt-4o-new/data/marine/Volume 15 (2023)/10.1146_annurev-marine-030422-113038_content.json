{"Abstract": "Marine organisms exhibit a remarkable array of rhythmic behaviors and physiological processes that are governed by endogenous oscillators. These biological clocks enable organisms to anticipate and adapt to regular environmental cycles, such as circadian (daily), circatidal (tidal), circalunar (monthly), and circannual (yearly) rhythms. This review explores the mechanisms underlying these oscillators in both algae and marine animals, highlighting the genetic and molecular bases of their timekeeping systems. The synchronization of these rhythms with environmental cues is crucial for survival, influencing behaviors such as feeding, reproduction, and migration. However, the increasing impact of climate change poses significant challenges to these finely tuned systems. Alterations in temperature, ocean currents, and light availability can disrupt the synchronization between endogenous rhythms and environmental cycles, potentially leading to maladaptive responses. Understanding the resilience and adaptability of marine organisms' biological clocks in the face of such changes is essential for predicting the ecological consequences of climate change. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the diversity and function of marine biological rhythms, emphasizing the need for further research to unravel the complex interactions between endogenous oscillators and the changing marine environment."}
