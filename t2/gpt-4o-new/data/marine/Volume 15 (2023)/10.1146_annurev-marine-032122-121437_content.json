{"Abstract": "Marine heatwaves, as extreme events driven by climate change, are increasingly impacting marine ecosystems worldwide. These prolonged periods of anomalously high sea temperatures disrupt the delicate balance of oceanic environments, leading to significant alterations in ecosystem services. The biological impacts are profound, affecting species distribution, abundance, and community structure. Ocean warming exacerbates these effects, threatening biodiversity and the resilience of marine ecosystems. This study synthesizes recent findings on the ecological consequences of marine heatwaves, highlighting the vulnerability of key species and habitats. It underscores the need for adaptive management strategies to mitigate these impacts and preserve ecosystem services vital for human well-being. Understanding the complex interactions between marine heatwaves and biological systems is crucial for predicting future changes and developing effective conservation policies in the face of ongoing environmental change."}
