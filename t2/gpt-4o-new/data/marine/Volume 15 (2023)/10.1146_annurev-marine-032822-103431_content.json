{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate dynamics of marine iron biogeochemistry through the lens of iron isotopes, offering novel insights into the sources and processes influencing iron distribution in the ocean. Utilizing data from the GEOTRACES program, we examine the isotopic signatures of iron derived from diverse sources, including atmospheric dust, continental sediments, and hydrothermal vents. Our findings reveal distinct isotopic fingerprints that enable the tracing of iron pathways and transformations within marine environments. The isotopic composition of iron from dust and sediments highlights the significant role of terrestrial inputs in oceanic iron cycling, while hydrothermal contributions are characterized by unique isotopic signatures that underscore their importance in deep-sea iron supply. This research advances our understanding of the complex interactions governing iron availability and its implications for marine ecosystems, emphasizing the critical role of isotopic studies in unraveling the biogeochemical cycles of essential trace metals in the ocean."}
