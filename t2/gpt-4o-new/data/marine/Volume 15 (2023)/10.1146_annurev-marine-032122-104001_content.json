{"Abstract": "The study of nitrogen isotopes in fossil-bound biominerals such as diatoms, foraminifera, and corals offers a unique window into past oceanic and atmospheric conditions. This research synthesizes recent advancements in the analysis of nitrogen isotopic compositions preserved in these organisms, providing insights into paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Diatoms, with their siliceous skeletons, and foraminifera, with their calcareous shells, serve as proxies for nutrient dynamics and ocean circulation patterns. Corals, through their aragonitic structures, offer records of nitrogen sources and cycling in reef environments. By examining the isotopic signatures of nitrogen in these biominerals, we can infer changes in primary productivity, nutrient utilization, and the nitrogen cycle over geological timescales. This study highlights the methodological advancements in isotope ratio mass spectrometry that have enhanced the precision and accuracy of nitrogen isotope measurements. The integration of these isotopic records with other paleoenvironmental proxies provides a comprehensive understanding of historical climate variability and its impact on marine ecosystems. These findings underscore the importance of nitrogen isotopes as a tool for reconstructing past environmental conditions and predicting future changes."}
