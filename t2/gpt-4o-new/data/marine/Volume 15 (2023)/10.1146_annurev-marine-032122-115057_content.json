{"Abstract": "The nearshore region is a dynamic interface where the exchange of plankton, pollutants, and particles significantly impacts coastal ecosystems and human activities. This study investigates the mechanisms driving cross-shore exchange, focusing on the roles of turbulence, wind, surface waves, and internal waves. By integrating field observations with numerical modeling, we elucidate how these physical processes influence particle behavior and transport. Our findings reveal that wind-driven currents and wave-induced turbulence enhance the dispersion of plankton and pollutants, while internal waves contribute to vertical mixing and cross-shore transport. The interplay between these factors determines the distribution and fate of particles, with implications for nutrient cycling, pollutant dispersion, and coastal management. This research advances our understanding of nearshore dynamics, providing insights critical for predicting ecological responses and informing strategies to mitigate pollution impacts in coastal zones."}
