{"Abstract": "The ocean's biological pump plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle by facilitating the transfer of carbon from the surface to the deep ocean, thus acting as a significant carbon sink. This study aims to quantify the efficiency and impact of the biological pump on global carbon sequestration using a combination of satellite oceanography and advanced biogeochemical modeling. By integrating satellite data with models, we assess the spatial and temporal variability of carbon export pathways and their contribution to long-term carbon storage. Our findings highlight the critical regions and processes that enhance carbon sequestration, providing insights into the ocean's capacity to mitigate climate change. This research underscores the importance of continuous monitoring and modeling to improve predictions of the ocean's response to anthropogenic CO2 emissions and to inform global carbon management strategies."}
