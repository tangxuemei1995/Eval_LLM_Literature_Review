{"Abstract": "The Deepwater Horizon blowout in 2010 resulted in one of the largest marine oil spills in history, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of oil transport mechanisms in marine environments. This study investigates the processes of oil spreading, dispersion, and droplet formation following the blowout, with a focus on the role of eddy diffusivity in these phenomena. Utilizing a combination of field data, laboratory experiments, and numerical modeling, we analyze the dynamics of oil droplet formation and their subsequent dispersion in the water column. Our findings highlight the critical influence of eddy diffusivity on the horizontal and vertical transport of oil, affecting both the rate and extent of oil spreading. The results demonstrate that smaller oil droplets, formed under high-energy conditions, are more susceptible to dispersion by turbulent eddies, leading to a wider distribution of oil in the marine environment. This research provides valuable insights into the complex interactions governing oil transport in oceanic settings, offering guidance for future response strategies and environmental impact assessments following similar incidents."}
