{"Abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent condition characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the liver, which can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have emerged as potential therapeutic agents due to their anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering properties. This review explores the mechanisms by which omega-3 fatty acids influence hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Omega-3 fatty acids modulate lipid metabolism by enhancing fatty acid oxidation and reducing lipogenesis, thereby decreasing hepatic fat accumulation. Additionally, they exert anti-inflammatory effects by altering eicosanoid production and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Clinical studies have demonstrated that omega-3 supplementation can improve liver histology in patients with NAFLD, particularly in reducing steatosis and inflammation. However, the impact on fibrosis remains inconclusive. Further research is needed to optimize dosing strategies and to fully elucidate the long-term benefits of omega-3 fatty acids in NAFLD management."}
