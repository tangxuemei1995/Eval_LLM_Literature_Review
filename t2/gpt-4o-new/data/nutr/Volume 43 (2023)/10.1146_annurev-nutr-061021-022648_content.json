{"Abstract": "Serine, a non-essential amino acid, plays a pivotal role in various metabolic pathways, influencing both health and disease states. This review explores the sources and sinks of serine in human nutrition and its metabolic interconversion with glycine, highlighting the significance of serine in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. The study delves into the metabolic flux of serine, examining its contribution to cellular processes such as nucleotide synthesis, phospholipid production, and neurotransmitter regulation. Furthermore, the paper discusses the implications of serine metabolism in neuropathy and diabetes, conditions where altered serine levels have been observed. Utilizing metabolomics, the research identifies biomarkers and pathways affected by serine dysregulation, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets. Understanding the balance of serine sources and sinks is crucial for developing nutritional and pharmacological strategies to mitigate disease progression and enhance health outcomes."}
