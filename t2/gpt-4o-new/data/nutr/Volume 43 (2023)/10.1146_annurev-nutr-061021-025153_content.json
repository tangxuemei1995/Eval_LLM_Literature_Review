{"Abstract": "Precision nutrition, a burgeoning field promising personalized dietary recommendations based on individual genetic, phenotypic, and environmental factors, is gaining significant attention. However, the scientific foundation supporting its application in public health remains underdeveloped. This review critically examines the current state of precision nutrition, highlighting the disparity between its potential and the existing evidentiary standards required to inform public health policies effectively. While precision nutrition offers a tailored approach to nutrient requirements, the biological variation among individuals poses challenges in establishing universally applicable dietary guidelines. The hype surrounding precision nutrition often surpasses the scientific validation necessary for its integration into nutrition policy aimed at chronic disease prevention. This paper underscores the need for rigorous research to substantiate precision nutrition's claims and to develop robust frameworks that can translate individual variability into actionable public health recommendations. Addressing these gaps is crucial for harnessing precision nutrition's promise in improving population health outcomes."}
