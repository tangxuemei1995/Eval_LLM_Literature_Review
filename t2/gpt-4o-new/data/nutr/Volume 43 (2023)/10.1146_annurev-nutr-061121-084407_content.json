{"Abstract": "Riboflavin deficiency, though rare in developed countries, remains a significant nutritional concern globally, particularly in regions with limited access to diverse diets. This deficiency is primarily caused by inadequate dietary intake, malabsorption syndromes, and increased physiological demands. The erythrocyte glutathione reductase activation coefficient (EGRac) is a reliable biomarker for assessing riboflavin status, with elevated EGRac values indicating deficiency. Clinical sequelae of riboflavin deficiency include anemia, due to impaired iron metabolism, and potential exacerbation of hypertension, as riboflavin is crucial for maintaining normal blood pressure levels. The Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) provide guidelines to prevent deficiency, yet awareness and adherence remain suboptimal in at-risk populations. Addressing riboflavin deficiency requires a multifaceted approach, including dietary diversification, supplementation, and public health initiatives to improve nutritional education and access to riboflavin-rich foods. Further research is needed to elucidate the full spectrum of clinical implications associated with riboflavin deficiency."}
