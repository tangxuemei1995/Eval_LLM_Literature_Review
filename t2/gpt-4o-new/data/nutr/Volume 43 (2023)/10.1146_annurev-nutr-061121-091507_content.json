{"Abstract": "Gluconeogenesis, a critical metabolic pathway for glucose production, plays a pivotal role in maintaining blood sugar levels, especially during fasting. This study investigates the alterations in gluconeogenesis flux in the context of metabolic diseases, such as insulin resistance and enzyme deficiencies. We explore how hormonal imbalances, particularly involving insulin and glucagon, modulate gluconeogenic activity. Additionally, the research examines the implications of altered gluconeogenesis in cancer metabolism, where increased glucose production supports tumor growth. By employing advanced metabolic flux analysis, we identify key regulatory enzymes and potential therapeutic targets. Our findings suggest that modulating gluconeogenesis could offer novel strategies for managing metabolic disorders and cancer, highlighting the need for further investigation into the complex interplay between metabolic pathways and disease states."}
