{"Abstract": "The placenta serves as a critical maternofetal interface, facilitating the exchange of nutrients, gases, and waste between mother and fetus. This study explores the complex structure and function of the placenta, with a focus on the syncytiotrophoblast layer, which plays a pivotal role in nutrient transport. The transition from histiotrophic to hemotrophic nutrition marks a significant developmental milestone, underscoring the placenta's adaptability in meeting the growing fetus's demands. We examine the role of nutrient transporters in mediating the selective transfer of essential molecules, ensuring fetal growth and development. Additionally, the phenomenon of placental mosaicism is discussed, highlighting its implications for fetal health and development. Through a comprehensive review of current literature, this research underscores the placenta's dynamic nature and its critical role in fetal development, providing insights into potential areas for therapeutic intervention in placental dysfunction."}
