{"Abstract": "Nutrition security, a critical component of public health, extends beyond food security by emphasizing the quality and diversity of dietary intake necessary for optimal health outcomes. This study explores the methodologies for assessing and monitoring nutrition security in the United States, aiming to enhance dietary intake and health outcomes. By integrating data from national surveys, health records, and socioeconomic indicators, we identify key determinants of nutrition security and their impact on population health. The research highlights the disparities in nutrition security across different demographics, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions. We propose a comprehensive framework for continuous monitoring, which includes the development of standardized metrics and the use of advanced data analytics. This approach facilitates the identification of at-risk populations and the evaluation of policy effectiveness. Our findings underscore the importance of a multi-sectoral strategy involving government, healthcare providers, and community organizations to ensure equitable access to nutritious foods, ultimately promoting healthier dietary patterns and reducing the burden of diet-related diseases."}
