{"Abstract": "The microbiota–gut–brain axis is a complex communication network that plays a crucial role in neurodevelopment and overall health. Recent research highlights the significant impact of maternal and infant nutrition on the development of this axis. Key nutritional components such as milk fat globule membrane (MFGM), human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), as well as prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics, have been identified as influential factors. Maternal nutrition during pregnancy and lactation can shape the infant's gut microbiota, which in turn affects brain development and function. MFGM and HMOs, present in breast milk, are particularly important for cognitive development and immune function. LC-PUFAs are essential for brain structure and function, while prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics contribute to a balanced gut microbiota, supporting the gut-brain communication. This review synthesizes current knowledge on how these nutritional elements influence the microbiota–gut–brain axis, emphasizing the need for further research to optimize maternal and infant nutrition strategies for improved neurodevelopmental outcomes."}
