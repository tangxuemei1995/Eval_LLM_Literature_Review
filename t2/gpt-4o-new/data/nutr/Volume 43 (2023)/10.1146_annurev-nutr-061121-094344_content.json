{"Abstract": "The intricate process of intestinal amino acid transport plays a pivotal role in maintaining metabolic health, influencing both nutrient absorption and systemic homeostasis. This review explores the mechanisms of amino acid transport across epithelial cells, emphasizing the role of membrane transporters in digestion and nutrient uptake. Recent studies highlight the impact of protein restriction on these transport pathways, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies for metabolic disorders. The regulation of amino acid transporters is crucial for optimizing nutrient absorption and preventing metabolic imbalances. Understanding the interplay between dietary protein intake and transporter activity could lead to novel interventions for improving metabolic health. This paper synthesizes current findings on the molecular dynamics of amino acid transport, offering insights into how dietary modifications can modulate these processes to enhance overall health outcomes. Future research directions are proposed to further elucidate the relationship between amino acid transport and metabolic regulation."}
