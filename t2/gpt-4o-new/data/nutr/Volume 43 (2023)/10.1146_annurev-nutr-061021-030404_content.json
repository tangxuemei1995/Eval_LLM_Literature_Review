{"Abstract": "Iron homeostasis during pregnancy is a critical aspect of maternal and fetal health, influenced by complex regulatory mechanisms involving the mother, placenta, and fetus. This review explores the dynamic interplay of these systems, focusing on the role of hepcidin, a key hormone in iron regulation. During pregnancy, maternal iron requirements increase significantly to support fetal development and placental function. The placenta acts as a mediator, modulating iron transfer to the fetus while responding to maternal iron status and inflammatory signals. Iron deficiency and inflammation can disrupt this balance, leading to adverse outcomes such as anemia and impaired fetal growth. Understanding the regulatory pathways, including hepcidin's modulation by maternal and fetal signals, is essential for developing strategies to manage iron deficiency and optimize pregnancy outcomes. This review highlights recent advances in the field, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to ensure adequate iron supply during pregnancy."}
