{"Abstract": "Osteocalcin, a bone-derived hormone, plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes beyond its traditional function in bone mineralization. Recent studies highlight its involvement in energy metabolism, where undercarboxylated osteocalcin enhances insulin secretion and sensitivity, thus influencing glucose homeostasis. Additionally, osteocalcin acts as a 'danger repellent,' modulating the body's response to stress and injury. This multifaceted hormone's ability to interact with multiple systems underscores its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic disorders and stress-related conditions. Understanding the mechanisms governing osteocalcin's diverse functions could pave the way for novel interventions in metabolic and bone health, emphasizing its significance in endocrinology and beyond."}
