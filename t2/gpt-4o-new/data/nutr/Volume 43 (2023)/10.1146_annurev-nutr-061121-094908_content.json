{"Abstract": "The intricate interplay between diet and the gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and management of gastrointestinal disorders. This review explores the mechanisms by which dietary components influence microbiota composition and function, impacting the gutâ€“brain axis and contributing to inflammation. Advances in metabolomics have elucidated the metabolic pathways through which microbiota-derived metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids from fermentation, modulate host physiology and immune responses. Understanding these interactions provides a foundation for developing microbiome-targeted therapies aimed at restoring microbial balance and alleviating gastrointestinal symptoms. Strategies such as prebiotics, probiotics, and dietary interventions are evaluated for their efficacy in modulating the microbiome to reduce inflammation and improve gut health. The potential of personalized nutrition, guided by microbiome profiling, is also discussed as a promising approach to tailor interventions for individual patients. This comprehensive analysis underscores the importance of integrating diet and microbiome research to devise effective therapeutic strategies for gastrointestinal disorders, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes."}
