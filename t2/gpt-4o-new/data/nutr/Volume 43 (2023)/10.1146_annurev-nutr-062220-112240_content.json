{"Abstract": "Mammalian fatty acidâ€“binding proteins (FABPs) are a diverse family of lipid-binding proteins that play crucial roles in lipid metabolism and transport. These proteins are integral to the regulation of fatty acid uptake, transport, and signaling, influencing various metabolic pathways. Recent studies have highlighted the multifunctional nature of FABPs, linking them to the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases and cancer. FABPs are involved in modulating lipid homeostasis, and their dysregulation is associated with conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, FABPs have been implicated in cancer progression, where they may affect tumor growth and metastasis through their role in lipid signaling pathways. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of FABP function could provide novel insights into therapeutic strategies for metabolic disorders and cancer, emphasizing the importance of these proteins in health and disease."}
