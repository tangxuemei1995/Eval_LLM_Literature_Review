{"Abstract": "The utilization of dietary supplements has become increasingly prevalent, yet significant gaps remain in our understanding of their role in health and disease. This review highlights the critical issues surrounding the validity and reproducibility of dietary supplement data, which are often compromised by methodological challenges. Key among these challenges is the accurate dietary assessment, which is frequently plagued by measurement errors that can obscure true associations between supplement use and health outcomes. The lack of standardized methodologies further complicates the ability to draw reliable conclusions from existing research. This paper underscores the necessity for improved methodological approaches that enhance the precision and accuracy of dietary supplement data collection and analysis. By addressing these gaps, future research can better elucidate the complex interactions between dietary supplements and health, ultimately informing public health recommendations and policy. The review calls for a concerted effort to develop and implement robust, standardized tools for dietary assessment, which are essential for advancing our understanding of the potential benefits and risks associated with dietary supplement use. Such advancements are crucial for translating scientific findings into practical guidance for consumers and healthcare providers."}
