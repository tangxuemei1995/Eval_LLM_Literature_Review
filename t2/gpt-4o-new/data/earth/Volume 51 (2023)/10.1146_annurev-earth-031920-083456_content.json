{"Abstract": "Solar geoengineering, a climate intervention strategy aimed at reflecting a portion of solar radiation back into space, has been proposed as a potential method to mitigate the impacts of climate change. This study examines the hydrological consequences of solar geoengineering, focusing on its effects on the global hydrologic cycle and precipitation patterns. By employing advanced climate models, we assess how solar radiation modification could alter atmospheric circulation, cloud formation, and regional precipitation. Our findings indicate that while solar geoengineering may effectively reduce global temperatures, it could also lead to significant disruptions in the hydrologic cycle. These disruptions include changes in the intensity and distribution of precipitation, potentially exacerbating droughts in some regions while increasing flood risks in others. The study highlights the complexity of climate systems and the potential for unintended consequences, emphasizing the need for comprehensive risk assessments before the implementation of geoengineering techniques. Furthermore, the research underscores the importance of integrating solar geoengineering strategies with broader climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts to ensure sustainable and equitable outcomes. The results contribute to the growing body of literature on climate intervention, providing critical insights into the potential hydrological impacts of solar geoengineering and informing policy discussions on its feasibility and ethical considerations. Future research should focus on regional impacts and the development of governance frameworks to manage the risks associated with geoengineering interventions."}
