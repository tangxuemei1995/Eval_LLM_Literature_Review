{"Abstract": "Mimas, one of Saturn's enigmatic moons, presents a compelling case for study due to its unique characteristics and potential classification as an ocean world. This research explores the possibility of Mimas being a frozen fragment, a relic of Saturn's rings, or an emerging ocean world. By examining its tectonic features, rotational dynamics, and satellite formation processes, we aim to unravel the mysteries surrounding this celestial body. Recent observations suggest that Mimas may harbor a subsurface ocean, indicated by its libration and the thermal anomalies detected on its surface. These findings challenge the traditional view of Mimas as a geologically inactive body and open new avenues for understanding its evolutionary history. The study also considers the implications of Mimas' potential oceanic nature on the broader context of ocean worlds within our solar system, contributing to the ongoing discourse on planetary habitability and the conditions necessary for life. Through a synthesis of observational data and theoretical models, this research seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of Mimas' role in the dynamic system of Saturn's moons and its potential as a key to unlocking the secrets of ocean worlds."}
