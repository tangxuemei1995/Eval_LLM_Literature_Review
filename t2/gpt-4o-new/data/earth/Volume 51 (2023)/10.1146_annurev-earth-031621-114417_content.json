{"Abstract": "The escalating threat of climate change necessitates a multifaceted approach to mitigate its impacts, with communication and behavior science playing pivotal roles. This study explores the intersection of these disciplines to enhance societal responses to climate change. By analyzing existing literature and case studies, we identify key strategies that leverage communication to influence public perception and behavior. Effective communication is crucial in translating scientific data into actionable knowledge, fostering a sense of urgency and responsibility among diverse audiences. The research highlights the importance of tailored messaging that considers cultural, social, and psychological factors, thereby increasing engagement and promoting sustainable practices. Furthermore, behavior science provides insights into the cognitive and emotional drivers of decision-making, offering tools to design interventions that encourage pro-environmental behaviors. Techniques such as social norm activation, commitment devices, and feedback mechanisms are examined for their efficacy in altering individual and collective actions. The integration of these strategies into policy and educational frameworks is discussed, emphasizing the role of interdisciplinary collaboration in crafting comprehensive solutions. This study underscores the potential of communication and behavior science to not only raise awareness but also to catalyze meaningful change, ultimately contributing to a more resilient and adaptive society in the face of climate change. Future research directions are proposed to further refine these approaches and assess their long-term impact."}
