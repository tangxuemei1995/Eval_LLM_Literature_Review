{"Abstract": "Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry has emerged as a powerful tool in geochemistry, offering insights into paleoclimate reconstructions and diagenetic processes. This technique leverages the temperature-dependent preference for certain isotopologues, specifically the 'clumping' of heavy isotopes within carbonate minerals, to infer formation temperatures independent of the isotopic composition of the water from which the carbonate precipitated. Recent advancements in analytical precision and calibration have expanded the applicability of clumped isotope thermometry across a range of carbonate materials, including biogenic carbonates, speleothems, and marine sediments. This review explores the frontiers of this rapidly evolving field, highlighting key methodological improvements, such as enhanced mass spectrometry techniques and refined calibration curves, which have increased the accuracy and resolution of temperature estimates. Additionally, the integration of clumped isotope data with other geochemical proxies is discussed, providing a more comprehensive understanding of past environmental conditions. Challenges remain, particularly in addressing kinetic isotope effects and diagenetic alterations that can obscure primary temperature signals. However, ongoing research is focused on developing robust correction models and exploring the potential of clumped isotopes in novel applications, such as tracing carbon cycle dynamics and assessing anthropogenic impacts on carbonate systems. As the field progresses, carbonate clumped isotope thermometry is poised to become an indispensable tool in the geoscientist's toolkit, offering unprecedented insights into Earth's climatic and geochemical history."}
