{"Abstract": "The rock-hosted biosphere, a largely unexplored frontier, harbors diverse microbial communities thriving in the Earth's subsurface. This study investigates the endolithic ecosystems, focusing on chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms inhabiting fractures within the crust. These microbes utilize inorganic compounds as energy sources, facilitating biogeochemical cycles in environments devoid of sunlight. By examining microbial activity in these subsurface habitats, we aim to elucidate the metabolic pathways that sustain life under extreme conditions. Our findings reveal that the rock-hosted biosphere plays a crucial role in Earth's carbon and nutrient cycles, with implications for understanding life's adaptability and resilience. The study also highlights the potential for similar ecosystems on other planetary bodies, expanding the scope of astrobiological research. This research underscores the importance of integrating geological and microbiological perspectives to fully comprehend the dynamics of subsurface life and its impact on global processes."}
