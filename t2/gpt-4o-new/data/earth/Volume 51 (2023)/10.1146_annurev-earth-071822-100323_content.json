{"Abstract": "The integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) into earthquake seismology represents a transformative approach to understanding and predicting seismic events. This study explores the application of neural networks and other ML techniques in analyzing vast datasets generated by seismic activities. Traditional seismological methods often struggle with the complexity and volume of data, whereas ML offers robust tools for pattern recognition and anomaly detection. By leveraging supervised and unsupervised learning models, researchers can enhance the accuracy of earthquake detection, improve the precision of epicenter localization, and refine the prediction of aftershock sequences. The adaptability of neural networks allows for the continuous improvement of models as more data becomes available, offering a dynamic solution to the challenges of seismic analysis. This paper reviews recent advancements in the field, highlighting successful case studies and identifying potential areas for future research. The findings underscore the potential of ML to revolutionize earthquake seismology, providing more reliable tools for risk assessment and disaster preparedness."}
