{"Abstract": "The process of planet formation is a complex and dynamic sequence of events, with giant impacts playing a pivotal role in shaping planetary bodies. This study delves into the significance of collisions and giant impacts in the context of planet formation, examining their influence on the physical and chemical evolution of planetary systems. Through a comprehensive review of recent observational data and advanced computational models, we explore how these colossal collisions contribute to the accretion and differentiation of planetary bodies. Giant impacts are shown to be critical in determining the final mass, spin, and orbital characteristics of planets, as well as in the formation of moons and the delivery of volatiles essential for habitability. The study highlights key case studies, such as the hypothesized giant impact that led to the formation of Earth's Moon, providing insights into the mechanisms by which such events can lead to significant planetary transformations. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of giant impacts for the diversity of exoplanetary systems, suggesting that variations in impact frequency and magnitude could account for the wide range of observed planetary architectures. By integrating findings from both theoretical and empirical research, this study underscores the necessity of considering giant impacts as a fundamental component of planet formation theories, offering a more nuanced understanding of how planets and their systems evolve over time."}
