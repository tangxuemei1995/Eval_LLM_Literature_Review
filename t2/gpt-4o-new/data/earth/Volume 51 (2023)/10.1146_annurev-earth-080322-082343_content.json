{"Abstract": "This autobiographical account of Estella Atekwana delves into her pioneering contributions to the field of biogeophysics, particularly in the study of continental rifts. Atekwana's narrative intertwines her scientific journey with personal insights, highlighting the challenges and triumphs of navigating a career in geophysics as part of a dual-career couple. Her story underscores the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in academia, advocating for systemic changes to foster student success and support underrepresented groups in the sciences. Through her experiences, Atekwana offers a unique perspective on the intersection of personal and professional life, emphasizing the role of mentorship and community in overcoming barriers. This work not only chronicles her scientific achievements but also serves as an inspirational guide for aspiring geophysicists, particularly those from diverse backgrounds, seeking to make their mark in the field."}
