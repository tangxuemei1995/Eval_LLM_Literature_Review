{"Abstract": "The Neogene period, spanning from approximately 23 to 2.6 million years ago, was a critical epoch for the evolution and diversification of the Amazonian flora. This study synthesizes geological, palynological, and molecular phylogenetic data to provide a comprehensive perspective on the Neogene history of Amazonian plant life. Geological evidence indicates significant tectonic activity, particularly the uplift of the Andes, which played a pivotal role in shaping the Amazon Basin's topography and hydrology. This orogenic event not only influenced the climate but also acted as a barrier and corridor for species migration, thereby affecting the distribution and diversification of plant species.\n\nPalynological records from sediment cores reveal shifts in vegetation composition and structure, reflecting responses to climatic fluctuations and geological transformations. These records indicate a dynamic interplay between forest expansion and contraction, driven by changes in precipitation patterns and temperature regimes. The palynological data also suggest that the Amazonian flora was more diverse and complex than previously thought, with evidence of both ancient lineages and newly emerging species during the Neogene.\n\nMolecular phylogenetic analyses provide insights into the evolutionary relationships and divergence times of key plant lineages within the Amazon. These analyses highlight the role of vicariance and dispersal in shaping the current phylogenetic structure of Amazonian flora. The integration of these data sources underscores the importance of the Neogene as a period of significant evolutionary innovation and adaptation in response to environmental changes.\n\nOverall, this study enhances our understanding of the paleobiogeography of the Amazon and underscores the intricate linkages between geological processes, climate change, and biological evolution. It also provides a framework for predicting how current and future environmental changes might impact Amazonian biodiversity."}
