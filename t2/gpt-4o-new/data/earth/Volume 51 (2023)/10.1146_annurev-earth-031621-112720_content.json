{"Abstract": "Elastic thermobarometry is an innovative approach to deciphering the pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions of metamorphic rocks by analyzing the elastic properties of mineral inclusions. This method leverages the principles of Raman spectroscopy to measure the residual stress and strain in inclusions, which are encapsulated within host minerals during metamorphism. By understanding the elastic, viscous, and plastic deformation behaviors of these inclusions, researchers can reconstruct the P-T history of metamorphic events with high precision. This technique offers significant advantages over traditional methods, providing insights into the dynamic processes of metamorphism and the conditions of mineral formation. The integration of elastic thermobarometry with other geochemical and petrological tools enhances our ability to interpret complex geological histories, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the Earth's crustal evolution and the mechanisms driving metamorphic transformations."}
