{"Abstract": "The transformation of Earth's environment by plants over geological time scales is a pivotal aspect of Earth's history, particularly during the late Paleozoic era. This study employs a systems approach to elucidate the complex interactions between plant functional traits, plant functional strategies, and their broader impacts on ecosystem and Earth system dynamics. By integrating ecosystem modeling with Earth system modeling, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how vegetation-climate interactions have historically shaped the planet's climate and atmospheric composition. The late Paleozoic era, characterized by significant evolutionary advancements in plant life, serves as a critical period for examining these interactions. During this time, the diversification of plant functional traits and strategies, such as the development of deep rooting systems and the evolution of vascular tissues, played a crucial role in altering carbon and water cycles. These changes, in turn, influenced global climate patterns and atmospheric CO2 levels, contributing to the transition from a greenhouse to an icehouse Earth. Our models incorporate data from paleobotanical records and geochemical proxies to simulate the feedback mechanisms between vegetation and climate. The results highlight the importance of plant-driven processes in modulating Earth's climate system and underscore the need for incorporating detailed plant functional traits into Earth system models to improve predictions of past and future climate scenarios. This research not only enhances our understanding of historical vegetation-climate interactions but also provides insights into the potential responses of modern ecosystems to ongoing climate change. By adopting a systems approach, this study bridges the gap between paleobotany and climate science, offering a holistic perspective on the role of plants in Earth's environmental evolution."}
