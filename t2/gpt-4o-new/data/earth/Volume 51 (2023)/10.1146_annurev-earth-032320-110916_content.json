{"Abstract": "Iceberg calving, the process by which chunks of ice break off from the edge of a glacier or ice shelf, plays a critical role in the dynamics of ice sheets and their contribution to sea-level rise. This study explores the various regimes and transitions of iceberg calving, focusing on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. By synthesizing recent observational data and modeling studies, we identify key factors influencing calving processes, including ice thickness, oceanic and atmospheric conditions, and the structural integrity of ice shelves. Our analysis reveals distinct calving regimes characterized by different physical mechanisms, such as tensile fracturing, melt-undercutting, and buoyant flexure. \n\nTransitions between these regimes are often driven by changes in environmental conditions, such as warming ocean temperatures and increased surface melting, which can destabilize ice shelves and accelerate calving rates. The study highlights the importance of understanding these transitions to predict future ice-sheet behavior and their potential impact on global sea levels. We also examine the feedback mechanisms between calving and ice-sheet dynamics, noting that increased calving can lead to ice-sheet thinning and grounding line retreat, further enhancing ice loss. \n\nOur findings underscore the need for improved calving models that incorporate the complex interactions between ice, ocean, and atmosphere to enhance predictions of ice-sheet stability. This research contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of iceberg calving processes and their implications for future sea-level rise, emphasizing the urgency of monitoring and modeling efforts in polar regions. By advancing our knowledge of calving regimes and transitions, we aim to inform policy decisions and climate adaptation strategies in response to the ongoing changes in Earth's cryosphere."}
