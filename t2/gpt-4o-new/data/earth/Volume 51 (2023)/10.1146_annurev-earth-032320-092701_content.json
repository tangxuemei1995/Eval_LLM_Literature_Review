{"Abstract": "The Phanerozoic Eon, spanning over 540 million years, has witnessed significant transformations in Earth's carbon cycle, driven by complex interactions between geological, biological, and climatic processes. Understanding these transformations is crucial for elucidating the evolution of carbon sources and sinks, which have played a pivotal role in regulating Earth's climate over deep time. This study synthesizes insights from a range of models that simulate the carbon cycle across the Phanerozoic, highlighting the dynamic interplay between carbon sources, such as volcanic outgassing and organic carbon burial, and sinks, including silicate weathering and carbonate deposition. \n\nModels of the Phanerozoic carbon cycle incorporate various feedback mechanisms that have influenced atmospheric CO2 levels and global temperatures. For instance, the weathering of silicate rocks, a key carbon sink, is modulated by climatic conditions and tectonic activity, which in turn are affected by atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This feedback loop is critical in understanding long-term climate stability and transitions, such as the shift from greenhouse to icehouse conditions. Additionally, the role of biological processes, including the evolution of land plants and marine organisms, has been integrated into models to assess their impact on carbon sequestration and atmospheric composition.\n\nThe study also examines the limitations and uncertainties inherent in modeling the Phanerozoic carbon cycle, such as the scarcity of direct geological and geochemical data and the challenges in reconstructing past environmental conditions. Despite these challenges, models have provided valuable insights into the temporal variability of carbon fluxes and the resilience of Earth's climate system to perturbations. \n\nBy comparing model outputs with empirical data, this research underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in refining our understanding of the carbon cycle over geological timescales. The findings have implications for predicting future climate scenarios, as they offer a long-term perspective on the natural processes that have historically regulated atmospheric CO2 levels. Ultimately, this study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the evolution of carbon sources and sinks, informing both paleoclimate reconstructions and contemporary climate change models."}
