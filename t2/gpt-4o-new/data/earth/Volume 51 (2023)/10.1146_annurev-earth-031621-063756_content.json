{"Abstract": "The ductile deformation of the lithospheric mantle is a critical process influencing the geodynamic behavior of tectonic plates and the evolution of the Earth's interior. This study investigates the mechanisms underlying ductile flow within the lithospheric mantle, with a particular focus on the role of olivine, the dominant mineral in this region. Through a comprehensive review of experimental and theoretical studies, we explore the conditions under which olivine exhibits plasticity, facilitating ductile deformation. The research highlights the influence of temperature, pressure, and grain size on the deformation mechanisms, including dislocation creep and diffusion creep, which govern the rheological properties of the mantle. We also examine the impact of water content and the presence of other mineral phases on the ductility of the lithospheric mantle. By integrating data from laboratory experiments, field observations, and numerical modeling, this study provides insights into the spatial and temporal variations in mantle deformation. The findings underscore the importance of ductile flow in accommodating tectonic stresses and contributing to mantle convection processes. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for interpreting seismic anisotropy and the thermal and mechanical evolution of the lithosphere. This research advances our knowledge of the complex interplay between mineral physics and geodynamic processes, offering implications for the broader field of Earth sciences."}
