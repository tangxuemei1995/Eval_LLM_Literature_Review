{"Abstract": "Understanding the energy dynamics during earthquakes is crucial for comprehending fault mechanics and seismic hazard assessment. This study investigates the roles of fracture energy and breakdown work in the context of earthquake rupture dynamics. Fracture energy, the energy required to propagate a crack, and breakdown work, the energy dissipated during the weakening phase of fault slip, are critical components of the earthquake energy budget. These parameters influence the dynamic weakening of faults, which in turn affects the rupture propagation and the overall seismic energy release. By analyzing a range of seismic events and employing advanced numerical simulations, this research delineates the relationship between fracture energy and breakdown work, highlighting their dependence on fault zone structure and material properties. The study reveals that variations in fault zone heterogeneity and stress conditions significantly impact the partitioning of energy between fracture energy and breakdown work. Furthermore, the findings suggest that dynamic weakening mechanisms, such as thermal pressurization and flash heating, play a pivotal role in modulating these energy components. This research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of rupture dynamics by providing insights into how fracture energy and breakdown work interact within the complex framework of fault mechanics. Ultimately, these insights enhance our ability to model earthquake processes and improve predictions of seismic hazard, offering valuable implications for earthquake engineering and risk mitigation strategies."}
