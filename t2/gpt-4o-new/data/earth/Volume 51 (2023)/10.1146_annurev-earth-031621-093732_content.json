{"Abstract": "River deltas are dynamic landforms at the interface of terrestrial and marine environments, playing a crucial role in coastal geomorphology and sedimentary geology. This study examines the impact of sea-level rise, driven by climate change, on the morphology and stability of river deltas worldwide. As global temperatures increase, the resulting thermal expansion of seawater and melting of ice caps contribute to rising sea levels, posing significant threats to deltaic regions. These areas are particularly vulnerable due to their low-lying topography and the complex interplay of fluvial and marine processes that govern their evolution. \n\nThe research synthesizes recent findings from geomorphological studies and climate models to assess the potential changes in deltaic systems under various sea-level rise scenarios. It highlights the mechanisms through which rising seas can alter sediment deposition patterns, leading to shoreline retreat, increased flooding, and loss of habitat. The study also explores adaptive strategies that can mitigate these impacts, such as sediment management, restoration of natural deltaic processes, and the implementation of engineered structures. \n\nFurthermore, the paper discusses the socio-economic implications of delta degradation, emphasizing the need for integrated management approaches that consider both environmental and human factors. By providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge, this research aims to inform policymakers and stakeholders involved in coastal management and climate adaptation planning. Ultimately, understanding the response of river deltas to sea-level rise is essential for preserving these vital ecosystems and the communities that depend on them. The findings underscore the urgency of addressing climate change to protect deltaic environments and ensure their resilience in the face of ongoing environmental challenges."}
