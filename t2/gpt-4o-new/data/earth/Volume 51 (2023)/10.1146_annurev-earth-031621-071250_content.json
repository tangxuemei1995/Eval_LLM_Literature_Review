{"Abstract": "The Lomagundi-Jatuli Excursion represents one of the most significant carbon isotope excursions in Earth's history, occurring during the Paleoproterozoic era, approximately 2.2 to 2.1 billion years ago. This study aims to deconstruct the complex interplay of geological and biological processes that contributed to this prolonged positive carbon isotope excursion, which coincides with the Great Oxidation Event (GOE). By synthesizing recent geochemical data and employing advanced isotopic modeling, we explore the potential mechanisms driving the excursion, including enhanced organic carbon burial, changes in volcanic activity, and shifts in oceanic and atmospheric chemistry. Our analysis suggests that the Lomagundi-Jatuli Excursion was likely a multifaceted event, influenced by a combination of increased photosynthetic activity and tectonic processes that facilitated the sequestration of organic carbon. Furthermore, the excursion's temporal alignment with the GOE implies a feedback loop where rising oxygen levels may have accelerated organic carbon burial, thereby sustaining elevated Î´13C values. This research not only elucidates the dynamics of early Earth's carbon cycle but also provides insights into the environmental conditions that fostered the emergence of complex life. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating isotopic data with geological and biological evidence to reconstruct ancient biogeochemical cycles and their impact on Earth's evolutionary trajectory."}
