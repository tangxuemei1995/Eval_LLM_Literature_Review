{"Abstract": "The formation of the Moon has long been a subject of scientific intrigue, with the giant impact hypothesis being the most widely accepted explanation. This hypothesis suggests that the Moon formed from the debris ejected after a Mars-sized body collided with the early Earth. However, the precise chronology of these events remains a topic of active research and debate. Recent advancements in isotopic dating techniques and computer modeling have provided new insights into the timeline of lunar formation and evolution. This study synthesizes current research on the chronology of the Moon's formation, focusing on the implications of the lunar magma ocean hypothesis and the model ages derived from isotopic analyses. By examining the isotopic signatures of lunar samples, particularly those of hafnium-tungsten and uranium-lead systems, researchers have been able to refine the timeline of the Moon's differentiation and solidification processes. The findings suggest that the Moon's formation occurred approximately 4.5 billion years ago, with the lunar magma ocean crystallizing over a period of tens of millions of years. This evolving chronology challenges previous models that proposed a more rapid solidification process. Additionally, the study explores the implications of these findings for understanding the thermal and chemical evolution of the Moon, as well as the broader context of planetary formation in the early solar system. By integrating data from various scientific disciplines, this research contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the Moon's complex formation history and its implications for planetary science."}
