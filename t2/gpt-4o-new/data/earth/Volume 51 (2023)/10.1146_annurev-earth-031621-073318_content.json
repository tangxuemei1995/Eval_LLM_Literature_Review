{"Abstract": "Mars seismology has emerged as a pivotal field of study, offering profound insights into the Red Planet's interior structure and geodynamic processes. The detection and analysis of marsquakes, facilitated by missions such as NASA's InSight lander, have provided unprecedented data on seismic activity on Mars. This research focuses on understanding the frequency, magnitude, and distribution of marsquakes, with particular attention to the Cerberus Fossae region, a geologically active area that has been identified as a significant source of seismic events. The study of marsquakes not only aids in mapping the Martian crust and mantle but also enhances our understanding of tectonic activity and thermal evolution. Additionally, the impact of meteoroids on Mars' surface contributes to the seismic activity, offering a unique opportunity to study impact-generated seismic waves and their propagation through the Martian interior. By analyzing these seismic events, researchers can infer the composition and state of the Martian core, mantle, and crust, providing clues about the planet's formation and evolution. The integration of seismological data with geological and geophysical observations has led to a more comprehensive model of Mars' interior structure, revealing differences and similarities with Earth. This research not only advances our understanding of Mars but also contributes to comparative planetology, offering insights into the dynamic processes that shape terrestrial planets. As Mars seismology continues to evolve, it holds the potential to answer fundamental questions about planetary formation and the potential for past or present life on Mars."}
