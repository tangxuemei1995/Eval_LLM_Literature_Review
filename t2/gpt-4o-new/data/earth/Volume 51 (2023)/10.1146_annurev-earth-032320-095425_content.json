{"Abstract": "The evolution of atmospheric oxygen (O2) levels throughout the Phanerozoic eon has been a subject of significant interest due to its profound impact on Earth's climate, biogeochemical cycles, and the evolution of life, particularly animals. This study revisits the fluctuations in atmospheric O2 concentrations over the past 541 million years, integrating recent advancements in geochemical modeling and isotopic analysis. By examining sedimentary records and employing state-of-the-art geochemical proxies, we provide a refined timeline of O2 variations and their correlation with major biological and geological events. Our findings suggest that O2 levels have not only been influenced by the carbon cycle and tectonic activities but also by the evolution and diversification of terrestrial and marine life forms. Notably, periods of significant O2 increase appear to coincide with major evolutionary milestones, such as the Cambrian explosion and the rise of large terrestrial animals. Conversely, declines in O2 levels are associated with mass extinction events, highlighting the intricate link between atmospheric composition and biological evolution. This comprehensive analysis underscores the dynamic nature of Earth's atmosphere and its critical role in shaping the biosphere. Our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between geochemical processes and evolutionary biology, offering insights into the potential future trajectories of Earth's atmospheric composition in response to ongoing anthropogenic influences."}
