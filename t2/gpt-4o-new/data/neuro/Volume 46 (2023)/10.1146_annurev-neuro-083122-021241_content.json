{"Abstract": "The integration of feedforward and feedback information streams is crucial for understanding the modular architecture of the mouse visual cortex. This study investigates the role of patchy connections and layer 1 in facilitating these interactions within the processing hierarchy. Utilizing advanced imaging techniques, we explore how M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors modulate these connections, influencing visual processing streams. Our findings reveal that layer 1 serves as a critical hub for integrating diverse information streams, with patchy connections providing a structural basis for this integration. The results suggest that M2 receptors play a significant role in modulating the strength and efficacy of these connections, offering insights into the dynamic processing capabilities of the visual cortex."}
