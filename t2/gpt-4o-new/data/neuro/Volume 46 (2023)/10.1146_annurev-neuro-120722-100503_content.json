{"Abstract": "The integration of vestibular and visual cues is crucial for effective spatial navigation, visual processing, and perception. This study explores the mechanisms by which the cerebral cortex synthesizes these multisensory inputs to facilitate coherent self-motion perception and navigation. By examining neural pathways and cortical regions involved in processing vestibular and visual information, we aim to elucidate how these systems interact to maintain spatial orientation and balance. Our findings suggest that specific cortical areas, such as the parietal and temporal lobes, play pivotal roles in integrating sensory inputs, thereby enhancing the accuracy of motion perception and navigation. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of multisensory integration in adapting to dynamic environments, suggesting that disruptions in these processes may contribute to navigational and perceptual deficits. This research advances our understanding of the neural basis of multisensory integration and its implications for developing interventions for disorders affecting balance and spatial awareness."}
