{"Abstract": "The neural control of sexually dimorphic social behavior is a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors that shape behavior from development through adulthood. This study explores the role of the social behavior network, focusing on GABAergic neurons, in modulating behaviors such as aggression and social play. We examine how epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and histone modification, influence the expression of genes involved in these neural circuits. Additionally, the enzyme aromatase, which converts testosterone to estrogen, is highlighted for its critical role in the sexual differentiation of the brain and subsequent behavior. By integrating developmental and adult stages, this research provides insights into how early-life experiences and genetic predispositions contribute to the establishment of sexually dimorphic behaviors. Understanding these processes may offer new perspectives on the treatment of social behavior disorders and enhance our comprehension of the biological underpinnings of gender-specific social interactions."}
