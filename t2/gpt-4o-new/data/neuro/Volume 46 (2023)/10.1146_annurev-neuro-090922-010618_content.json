{"Abstract": "The development of cognitive maps, essential for spatial navigation and memory, involves intricate neural circuits and computations within the brain. This study explores the formation and maturation of these maps, focusing on the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, key regions implicated in spatial representation. We examine the ontogeny of grid cells, place cells, and their interactions, elucidating how these neural elements contribute to the encoding and retrieval of spatial information. Through a synthesis of developmental neuroscience and computational modeling, we highlight the role of experience and environmental interactions in shaping these circuits. Our findings suggest that the integration of sensory inputs and intrinsic neural dynamics is crucial for the emergence of a functional cognitive map. This research advances our understanding of the neural basis of navigation and memory, offering insights into how spatial representations are constructed and maintained in the brain."}
