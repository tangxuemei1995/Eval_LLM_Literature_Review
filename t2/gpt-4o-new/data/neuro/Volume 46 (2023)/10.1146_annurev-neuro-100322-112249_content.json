{"Abstract": "Circadian rhythms, the intrinsic 24-hour cycles governing physiological processes, are crucial for maintaining homeostasis. Astrocytes, a type of glial cell, have emerged as significant players in the regulation of these rhythms, influencing both neuronal activity and overall brain function. This review explores the dualistic roles of astrocytes in circadian regulation, highlighting their beneficial contributions to calcium signaling and gliotransmitter release, which are essential for sleep regulation and cognitive function. However, dysregulation of astrocytic circadian rhythms can lead to detrimental outcomes, such as exacerbating neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease and promoting the progression of gliomas. The complex interplay between astrocytic function and circadian rhythms presents both therapeutic opportunities and challenges. Understanding these dynamics is critical for developing interventions aimed at mitigating the adverse effects of circadian disruption in neurological disorders. This review underscores the need for further research into astrocyte-specific circadian mechanisms to harness their potential in clinical applications."}
