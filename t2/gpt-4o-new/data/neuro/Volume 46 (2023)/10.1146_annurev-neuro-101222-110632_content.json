{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between the body and brain in the context of memory, focusing on the exaptation of memory processes. Central to this investigation is the hippocampus, a critical structure for memory consolidation, and its role in sharp-wave ripples (SWRs), which are believed to facilitate memory replay and integration. We examine how these neural processes are influenced by physiological states, particularly through mechanisms of homeostasis and allostasis, which maintain internal stability and adapt to external demands, respectively. The research highlights the bidirectional influence between body control systems, such as glucose regulation, and cognitive functions, suggesting that metabolic states can modulate hippocampal activity and memory performance. By integrating insights from neuroscience and physiology, this study proposes a model where memory processes are not only brain-dependent but also significantly shaped by bodily states, offering a comprehensive understanding of cognition as a dynamic body-brain partnership."}
