{"Abstract": "Spinal interneurons play a crucial role in the intricate circuitry of the spinal cord, significantly influencing motor control and locomotion. This review explores the diversity and connectivity of spinal interneurons, particularly within the ventral horn, where they integrate sensory inputs and modulate motor outputs. Recent advances in genetic and imaging techniques have unveiled a complex network of interneurons, each with distinct molecular identities and functional roles. These interneurons form dynamic circuits that are essential for the coordination and execution of locomotor activities. Understanding the specific contributions of different interneuron subtypes to motor control can provide insights into the mechanisms underlying normal and pathological motor function. This knowledge is pivotal for developing therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring motor abilities following spinal cord injuries or neurodegenerative diseases. The review highlights the need for further research to map the complete connectivity and functional diversity of spinal interneurons."}
