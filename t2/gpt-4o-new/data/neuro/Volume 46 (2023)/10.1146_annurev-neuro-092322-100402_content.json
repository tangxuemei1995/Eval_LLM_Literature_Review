{"Abstract": "Context-dependent learning is a fundamental cognitive process that enables organisms to adaptively respond to varying environmental cues. This study explores the computational and neural mechanisms underlying this form of learning, emphasizing the roles of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and motor cortex. By integrating principles of Bayesian inference, we propose a model of continual learning that accounts for the dynamic updating of memory representations in response to contextual changes. Our findings suggest that the prefrontal cortex orchestrates context-dependent learning by modulating neural computations across the hippocampus and thalamus, facilitating the encoding and retrieval of context-specific information. Additionally, the motor cortex is implicated in translating these neural computations into adaptive behavioral responses. This research advances our understanding of the neural substrates of learning and memory, offering insights into how the brain efficiently manages and utilizes contextual information to guide behavior in complex environments."}
