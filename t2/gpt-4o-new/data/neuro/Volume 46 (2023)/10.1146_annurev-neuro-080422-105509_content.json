{"Abstract": "Migraine, a prevalent and debilitating neurological disorder, is intricately linked to the meningeal structures and their associated mechanisms. This review explores the role of the meninges in migraine pathophysiology, focusing on the activation and sensitization of meningeal afferents. The trigeminal nerve, a key player in headache disorders, innervates the meninges and is implicated in the transmission of nociceptive signals. Neurogenic inflammation within the meninges, characterized by the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, contributes to the sensitization of these afferents, exacerbating migraine symptoms. Additionally, cortical spreading depression, a wave of neuronal and glial depolarization, is proposed to trigger meningeal nociception, linking cortical events to headache onset. Understanding these complex interactions offers insights into potential therapeutic targets for migraine management, emphasizing the need for further research into meningeal contributions to migraine pathogenesis."}
