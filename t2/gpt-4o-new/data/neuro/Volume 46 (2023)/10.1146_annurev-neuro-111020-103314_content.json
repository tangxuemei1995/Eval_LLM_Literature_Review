{"Abstract": "Understanding the neural circuits underlying emotion is crucial for advancing affective neuroscience. This study explores the intricate networks that govern emotional states and valence, employing cross-species approaches to elucidate conserved mechanisms. By integrating circuit neuroscience techniques, such as optogenetics and in vivo imaging, with behavioral assays, we identify key neural pathways involved in the modulation of positive and negative emotions. Our findings highlight the role of specific brain regions, including the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, in processing emotional valence. Comparative analyses across species reveal evolutionary conserved circuits, providing insights into the fundamental architecture of emotion regulation. This research not only enhances our comprehension of the neural basis of emotions but also paves the way for developing targeted interventions for affective disorders. Future studies should focus on the dynamic interactions between these circuits to further unravel the complexities of emotional processing."}
