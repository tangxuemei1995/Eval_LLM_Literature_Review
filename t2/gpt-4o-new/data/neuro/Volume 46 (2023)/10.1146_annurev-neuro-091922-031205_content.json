{"Abstract": "Astrocyte endfeet, integral components of the neurovascular unit, play a crucial role in maintaining brain homeostasis and function. These specialized structures envelop cerebral vasculature, contributing to the regulation of the blood-brain barrier, cerebral blood flow, and neurovascular coupling. Despite significant advances, several questions remain regarding the precise mechanisms by which astrocyte endfeet influence these processes. Understanding the dynamic interactions between astrocyte endfeet and the vasculature is essential for elucidating their role in both normal brain function and pathology. This review highlights current knowledge gaps, focusing on the molecular and cellular pathways involved in endfoot-mediated regulation of vascular function. Addressing these open questions is critical for developing therapeutic strategies targeting astrocyte endfeet in neurological disorders characterized by vascular dysfunction, such as stroke and neurodegenerative diseases."}
