{"Abstract": "Cholesterol metabolism plays a crucial role in the aging process and the pathogenesis of age-related neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. This review explores the intricate relationship between cholesterol homeostasis and neuronal function, emphasizing the impact of dysregulated cholesterol metabolism on microglia and neurons. As the brain ages, alterations in cholesterol transport and synthesis can lead to neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction, contributing to cognitive decline. In Alzheimer's disease, aberrant cholesterol metabolism is linked to amyloid-beta accumulation and tau pathology, exacerbating neurodegeneration. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cholesterol dysregulation in aging brains may reveal novel therapeutic targets for mitigating age-related cognitive impairments. This study highlights the need for further research into cholesterol-modulating strategies to preserve neuronal health and function in the elderly, potentially offering new avenues for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other age-associated neurological conditions."}
