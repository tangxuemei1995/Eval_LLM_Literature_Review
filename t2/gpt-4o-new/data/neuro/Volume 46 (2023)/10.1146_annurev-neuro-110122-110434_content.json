{"Abstract": "Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a promising neuromodulatory intervention for treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders, particularly Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and depression. This review synthesizes current research on the efficacy and mechanisms of DBS in these conditions, highlighting its role in psychiatric neurosurgery. DBS involves the implantation of electrodes in specific brain regions, such as the subthalamic nucleus and ventral capsule/ventral striatum, to modulate dysfunctional neural circuits. Clinical trials and case studies demonstrate significant symptom reduction in patients with severe OCD and depression, who have not responded to conventional therapies. Despite its potential, DBS presents challenges, including patient selection, optimal target identification, and long-term effects. Advances in neuroimaging and personalized medicine are expected to enhance DBS outcomes. This paper underscores the need for further research to refine DBS protocols and improve understanding of its neuromodulatory mechanisms in psychiatric disorders."}
