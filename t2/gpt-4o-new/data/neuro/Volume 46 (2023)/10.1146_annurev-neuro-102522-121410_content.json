{"Abstract": "The primate brain exhibits specialized networks that underpin social cognition, a critical aspect of navigating complex social environments. This study explores the functional brain organization related to social cognition, emphasizing the role of the 'social brain' in processing social information. We investigate the neural substrates involved in face processing and social interaction analysis, which are essential for recognizing and interpreting social cues. By integrating findings from neuroimaging studies and behavioral analyses, we delineate the distinct neural circuits that facilitate social knowledge acquisition and application. Our results highlight the interconnectedness of regions such as the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and superior temporal sulcus, which collectively support the perception and interpretation of social stimuli. This research advances our understanding of how specialized networks in the primate brain contribute to social cognition, offering insights into the evolutionary adaptations that enable complex social behaviors. These findings have implications for understanding social cognitive deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders."}
