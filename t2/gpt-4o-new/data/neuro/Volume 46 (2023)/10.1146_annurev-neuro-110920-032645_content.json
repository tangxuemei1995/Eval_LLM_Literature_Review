{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate role of neural networks in navigation, focusing on the computational processes underlying memory, menotaxis, path integration, head direction, dopamine signaling, and coordinate transformation. By examining the neural substrates that facilitate these navigational functions, we aim to elucidate how connections within the brain translate into complex computations necessary for spatial orientation and movement. The research highlights the integration of sensory inputs and internal states, mediated by dopaminergic pathways, to support adaptive navigation strategies. Furthermore, we investigate the transformation of coordinate systems within neural circuits, which enables the seamless transition between different frames of reference. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms that underpin navigation, offering insights into how these processes can be modeled and potentially enhanced through artificial neural networks. This work has implications for developing advanced navigational technologies and understanding neurological disorders affecting spatial cognition."}
