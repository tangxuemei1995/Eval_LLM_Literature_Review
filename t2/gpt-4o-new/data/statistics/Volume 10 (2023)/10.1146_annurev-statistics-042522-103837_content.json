{"Abstract": "This review explores the concepts of generalizability and transportability within the context of causal inference, focusing on their roles in assessing external validity and treatment effect heterogeneity. Generalizability refers to the extent to which findings from a study can be applied to broader populations, while transportability involves adapting causal inferences from one setting to another with potentially different conditions. The review synthesizes recent advancements in methodologies that address these challenges, highlighting the importance of understanding population differences and contextual factors. It discusses frameworks and statistical techniques that enhance the robustness of causal claims across diverse settings. By examining case studies and empirical applications, the review underscores the practical implications of these concepts in policy-making and clinical decision-making. The findings emphasize the need for rigorous design and analysis strategies to ensure that causal inferences are both valid and applicable across various contexts, ultimately contributing to more effective and equitable interventions."}
