{"Abstract": "Approximate methods for Bayesian computation, such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and Bayesian synthetic likelihood, offer efficient alternatives to traditional techniques. These methods address computational challenges by employing strategies like subsampling, coreset construction, and divide-and-conquer approaches. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques are often integrated to enhance sampling efficiency. This paper reviews recent advancements in these approximate methods, highlighting their potential to handle complex models and large datasets, thereby broadening the applicability of Bayesian inference in various scientific domains."}
