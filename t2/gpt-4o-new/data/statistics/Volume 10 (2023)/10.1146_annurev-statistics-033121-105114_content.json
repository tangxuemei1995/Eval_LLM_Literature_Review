{"Abstract": "The increasing emphasis on open science has underscored the importance of data reusability and research transparency, with statistics playing a pivotal role in this paradigm shift. This study explores how statistical methodologies enhance data quality, thereby facilitating data sharing and reuse. By employing robust statistical techniques, researchers can ensure the accuracy and reliability of datasets, which are critical for reproducibility and replicability in scientific research. The paper discusses various statistical approaches that contribute to the standardization and validation of data, making it more accessible and interpretable for secondary analyses. Furthermore, it highlights the challenges and opportunities associated with integrating statistical practices into open science frameworks. The findings suggest that a strong statistical foundation not only improves data integrity but also fosters a culture of transparency and collaboration among researchers. This work advocates for the adoption of comprehensive statistical guidelines to support sustainable data ecosystems, ultimately advancing scientific discovery and innovation."}
