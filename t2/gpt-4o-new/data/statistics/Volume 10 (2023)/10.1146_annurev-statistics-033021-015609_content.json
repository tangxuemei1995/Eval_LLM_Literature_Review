{"Abstract": "This study explores the critical role of biostatistics in enhancing statistical capacity-building across Africa, emphasizing sustainable development through education, consulting, and research. The paper highlights the importance of fostering human capital by developing robust educational programs and training initiatives tailored to the unique needs of African nations. It examines the potential of Southâ€“North collaborations to bridge gaps in expertise and resources, facilitating knowledge transfer and capacity enhancement. The research underscores the necessity of integrating biostatistics into public health and policy-making processes, thereby improving data-driven decision-making. By analyzing current challenges and opportunities, the study proposes strategic frameworks for sustainable capacity-building, focusing on long-term partnerships and local empowerment. The findings suggest that a concerted effort in biostatistics education and consulting can significantly contribute to the continent's statistical infrastructure, ultimately supporting broader socio-economic development goals. This paper serves as a call to action for stakeholders to invest in and prioritize biostatistics as a cornerstone of Africa's statistical capacity-building efforts."}
