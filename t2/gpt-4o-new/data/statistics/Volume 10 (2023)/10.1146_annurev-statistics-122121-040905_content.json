{"Abstract": "Simulation-based Bayesian analysis has become a cornerstone in modern statistical inference, leveraging computational techniques to approximate complex posterior distributions. This paper explores the integration of various Bayesian computation methods, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques such as Gibbs sampling, and the use of statistical software like BUGS, Stan, and JAGS. Additionally, we examine the role of Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA) and Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMPs) in enhancing computational efficiency. The application of these methods within graphical models is highlighted, demonstrating their capacity to handle high-dimensional data. Our analysis underscores the importance of these tools in advancing Bayesian inference, offering insights into their implementation and potential for future research developments."}
