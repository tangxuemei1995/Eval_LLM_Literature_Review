{"Abstract": "The 2020 US Census of Population and Housing implemented advanced statistical disclosure limitation techniques to enhance confidentiality protection. This study examines the application of differential privacy, a method designed to safeguard individual data while allowing for accurate aggregate statistics. The integration of differential privacy marks a significant shift in census data protection, addressing growing concerns over privacy in the digital age. The implications for redistricting and policy-making are profound, as the balance between data utility and confidentiality is recalibrated. This research highlights the challenges and successes of implementing differential privacy in large-scale national data collection efforts."}
