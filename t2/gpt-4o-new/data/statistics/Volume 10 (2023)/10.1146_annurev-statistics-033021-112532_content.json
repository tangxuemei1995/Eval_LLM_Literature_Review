{"Abstract": "The integration of diverse data types in Bayesian phylogenetics has emerged as a pivotal approach to enhance the accuracy and robustness of evolutionary inferences. This study explores the synthesis of Bayesian networks with continuous-time Markov processes and Gaussian processes to improve phylogenetic comparative methods and phylogeography. Bayesian networks provide a flexible framework for modeling complex dependencies among evolutionary traits, while continuous-time Markov processes are instrumental in modeling the stochastic nature of evolutionary changes over time. Gaussian processes offer a powerful tool for capturing spatial and temporal correlations in phylogeographic data. By integrating these methodologies, we aim to address the challenges of heterogeneity and uncertainty inherent in phylogenetic data. Our approach allows for the simultaneous analysis of genetic, morphological, and ecological data, providing a more comprehensive understanding of evolutionary processes. We demonstrate the application of this integrated framework through case studies involving diverse taxa, highlighting its potential to uncover novel insights into evolutionary history and biogeographic patterns. The results underscore the importance of data integration in advancing phylogenetic research and offer a promising avenue for future studies in evolutionary biology. This work contributes to the growing body of literature advocating for the use of sophisticated statistical models in phylogenetic analysis."}
