{"Abstract": "This review explores recent advancements in shared frailty methods for analyzing complex survival data, focusing on clustered data, competing events, and recurrent events. We examine the integration of accelerated failure time models and Cox regression in handling heterogeneity within clusters. The review highlights the application of regression trees and random survival forests in capturing non-linear relationships and interactions in survival data. Emphasis is placed on the methodological innovations that enhance the robustness and interpretability of survival models in the presence of frailty. By synthesizing recent literature, this review provides insights into the practical implementation of shared frailty models, offering guidance for researchers dealing with intricate survival data structures."}
