{"Abstract": "The balance between privacy and utility in statistical data analysis is a critical concern in the era of big data. This paper explores the intricate relationship between statistical data privacy and utility, focusing on methodologies such as statistical disclosure control and formal privacy frameworks, including differential privacy. We examine how these approaches can be harmonized to protect individual privacy while maintaining the integrity and usefulness of data for inference. The study delves into the theoretical underpinnings of differential privacy, highlighting its robustness in providing quantifiable privacy guarantees. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and trade-offs involved in implementing these privacy-preserving techniques in real-world applications. By analyzing case studies and recent advancements, we aim to provide insights into optimizing privacy-utility trade-offs. Our findings suggest that while perfect privacy and utility are unattainable, strategic compromises can significantly enhance data protection without severely compromising analytical outcomes. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on achieving sustainable data privacy in statistical analysis."}
