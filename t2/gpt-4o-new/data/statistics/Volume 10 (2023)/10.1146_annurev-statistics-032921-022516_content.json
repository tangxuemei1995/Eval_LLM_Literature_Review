{"Abstract": "This study explores advanced models for integer data, focusing on univariate distributions and time-series models. We delve into the application of thinning operators, which are instrumental in constructing flexible models for count data. The Skellam distribution, a prominent model for differences between two independent Poisson-distributed variables, is examined for its utility in various statistical contexts. By integrating thinning operators with the Skellam distribution, we propose novel methodologies for modeling integer-valued time series. These models are particularly relevant for fields requiring precise count data analysis, such as epidemiology and finance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of these models to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of integer data analysis, offering significant improvements over traditional approaches. Future research directions include extending these models to multivariate contexts."}
