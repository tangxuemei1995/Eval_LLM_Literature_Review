{"Abstract": "Graph-based change-point analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for detecting structural changes in complex datasets, particularly in high-dimensional, network, and non-Euclidean data. This study explores nonparametric graph-based tests, leveraging scan statistics to identify change-points without assuming specific data distributions. By focusing on tail probabilities, the proposed methods enhance sensitivity to subtle changes in data structure, which are often missed by traditional parametric approaches. The research demonstrates the efficacy of these techniques through simulations and real-world applications, highlighting their robustness in diverse settings. The integration of graph-based methods with change-point analysis offers a novel perspective, enabling the detection of changes in data connectivity and topology. This approach is particularly advantageous in high-dimensional and network data, where traditional methods struggle with scalability and complexity. The findings underscore the potential of graph-based change-point analysis as a versatile tool for uncovering hidden patterns and shifts in various scientific and engineering domains."}
