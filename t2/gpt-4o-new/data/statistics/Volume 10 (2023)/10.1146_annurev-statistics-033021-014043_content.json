{"Abstract": "The Cox proportional hazards model, introduced in 1972, has become a cornerstone in survival analysis, offering a robust framework for examining the relationship between covariates and the hazard function. Over the past fifty years, the model has been extensively developed and adapted to address various complexities in survival data. Key advancements include the handling of competing risks, where the model has been extended to accommodate situations where multiple types of events can occur, influencing the risk of the event of interest. The concept of independent censoring has been crucial in ensuring unbiased estimation of model parameters, while the introduction of time-dependent covariates has allowed for more dynamic modeling of hazard rates over time. The development of partial likelihood methods has facilitated efficient estimation and hypothesis testing without requiring the specification of the baseline hazard function. Additionally, the model has been adapted for recurrent events, enabling the analysis of repeated occurrences of the same event type. The integration of intensity and marginal rate models has further expanded the applicability of the Cox model in complex survival data scenarios. This review highlights these significant contributions and discusses ongoing challenges and future directions in the application of the Cox model in survival analysis."}
