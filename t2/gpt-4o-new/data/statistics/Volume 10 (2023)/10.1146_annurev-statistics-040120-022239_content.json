{"Abstract": "This study explores the application of bootstrap methods in high-dimensional data settings, focusing on empirical and multiplier bootstrap techniques. We investigate their efficacy in addressing challenges posed by the high-dimensional central limit theorem, particularly in the context of multiple testing and simultaneous inference. Our findings demonstrate that these bootstrap approaches provide robust solutions for accurate inference in complex data environments, enhancing statistical power and control over Type I errors. This work contributes to the development of reliable statistical tools for high-dimensional data analysis."}
