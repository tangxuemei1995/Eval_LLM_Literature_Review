{"Abstract": "Model-based clustering is a statistical approach that leverages mixture models to identify subgroups within a dataset. This method assumes that data are generated from a mixture of underlying probability distributions, each representing a distinct cluster. The expectationâ€“maximization (EM) algorithm is commonly employed to estimate the parameters of these mixture models, iteratively refining estimates to maximize the likelihood of the observed data. Bayesian inference further enhances model-based clustering by incorporating prior information, allowing for more robust parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification. Recent advancements in software development have facilitated the application of model-based clustering, providing user-friendly tools for practitioners to implement these sophisticated techniques. This paper reviews the theoretical underpinnings of model-based clustering, discusses the role of the EM algorithm and Bayesian methods, and highlights the capabilities of contemporary software solutions, underscoring their impact on diverse fields such as bioinformatics, marketing, and social sciences."}
