{"Abstract": "The detection of exoplanets using radial velocity (RV) measurements is a critical area of astrophysical research, requiring sophisticated statistical methods to address challenges such as correlated noise, model misspecification, and uneven sampling. This study explores advanced statistical techniques for analyzing multivariate time series data in the context of exoplanet detection. We focus on model comparison strategies to discern planetary signals from stellar activity and instrumental noise, emphasizing the importance of accurately modeling correlated noise. Our approach incorporates Bayesian frameworks and machine learning algorithms to improve the robustness and reliability of exoplanet detection. We demonstrate the efficacy of these methods through simulations and real-world data applications, highlighting their potential to enhance the precision of RV measurements. This research contributes to the development of more accurate and efficient tools for the discovery and characterization of exoplanets, advancing our understanding of planetary systems beyond our own."}
