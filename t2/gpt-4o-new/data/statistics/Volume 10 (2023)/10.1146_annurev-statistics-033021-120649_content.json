{"Abstract": "The integration of machine learning algorithms in risk assessment, particularly within the criminal justice system, has raised significant concerns regarding fairness and discrimination. This study explores the development of fair risk algorithms that mitigate bias while maintaining predictive accuracy. By leveraging optimal transport theory, we propose a novel framework for conformation prediction that aligns algorithmic outputs with equitable outcomes. Our approach systematically addresses disparities by adjusting the distribution of risk scores across different demographic groups, ensuring that predictions do not disproportionately disadvantage any particular group. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our method effectively reduces bias without compromising the performance of risk assessments. This research contributes to the growing body of work on algorithmic fairness, offering a robust solution for implementing equitable machine learning models in high-stakes decision-making contexts. The findings underscore the importance of integrating fairness considerations into the design and deployment of predictive algorithms."}
