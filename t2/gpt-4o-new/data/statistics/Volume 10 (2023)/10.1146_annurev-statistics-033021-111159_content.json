{"Abstract": "This study explores the development and application of three-decision methods in statistical significance testing, offering a comprehensive framework that extends beyond traditional binary decision-making. By integrating decision theory principles, the proposed methods enhance the interpretability and robustness of statistical tests. The research emphasizes the importance of considering power and sensitivity analysis in the context of multiple testing scenarios, where conventional approaches often fall short. Through a series of simulations and real-world applications, the study demonstrates how three-decision methods can improve decision-making processes by incorporating an additional decision option, thus reducing the risk of Type I and Type II errors. This approach not only refines the understanding of statistical significance but also provides a more nuanced tool for researchers across various scientific disciplines, promoting more informed and reliable conclusions."}
