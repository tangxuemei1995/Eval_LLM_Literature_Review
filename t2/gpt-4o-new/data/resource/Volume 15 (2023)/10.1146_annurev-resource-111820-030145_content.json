{"Abstract": "This critical review examines the Market Stability Reserve (MSR) within the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), focusing on its role in enhancing market stability amid overlapping climate policies. The analysis highlights the MSR's effectiveness in addressing surplus allowances and price volatility, while considering its interaction with other policy instruments. The study underscores the need for adaptive mechanisms to ensure the EU ETS's robustness in achieving long-term climate objectives."}
