{"Abstract": "This review examines the multifaceted impacts of climate change-related risks on the financial sector, with a focus on banking, insurance, and financial markets. As the frequency and severity of natural disasters increase, financial institutions face heightened exposure to physical risks, such as property damage and business interruptions, which can lead to significant financial losses. The banking sector is particularly vulnerable to credit risks arising from borrowers' inability to repay loans due to climate-induced disruptions. Insurance companies are grappling with escalating claims and the challenge of accurately pricing climate risks, which threatens their solvency and market stability. Financial markets are also affected, as climate risks influence asset valuations and investor behavior, leading to increased volatility and potential market corrections. This review highlights the need for enhanced risk assessment frameworks and the integration of climate risk considerations into financial decision-making processes. It also underscores the importance of regulatory interventions and the development of innovative financial instruments to mitigate these risks. By synthesizing current research, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the financial sector's vulnerabilities to climate change and to inform strategies for building resilience against future climate-related challenges."}
