{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of competition policy and environmental sustainability, focusing on how antitrust regulations can accommodate sustainability agreements among firms. By analyzing the role of competition analysis in fostering cooperation for environmental goals, the research highlights the potential for aligning firm green preferences with industrial organization principles. The paper examines case studies where firms have successfully integrated sustainability into their competitive strategies without breaching antitrust laws. It also discusses the challenges and opportunities presented by such integration, emphasizing the need for a nuanced approach to competition policy that considers environmental impacts. The findings suggest that well-designed competition policies can promote both market efficiency and environmental sustainability, encouraging firms to innovate and collaborate in ways that benefit both the economy and the environment."}
