{"Abstract": "This study investigates the impact of temperature variations on labor productivity, focusing on both physical and mental tasks. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset, we analyze how temperature fluctuations affect productivity levels and explore the role of adaptation mechanisms. The research highlights the significance of early-life exposure to temperature extremes in shaping long-term productivity outcomes. Additionally, we examine the distributional effects across different sectors and demographic groups. Our findings underscore the importance of developing adaptive strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of temperature changes on labor productivity in a warming climate."}
