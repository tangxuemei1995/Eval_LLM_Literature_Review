{"Abstract": "This study examines the impact of environmental regulation on labor demand, synthesizing evidence from various sectors and regions. While environmental policies aim to mitigate ecological harm, their influence on employment remains contentious. The analysis reveals that stringent regulations can lead to short-term job losses in pollution-intensive industries due to increased compliance costs. However, these effects are often offset by job creation in green sectors and through innovation-driven productivity gains. The net impact on labor demand varies by industry, regulatory stringency, and regional economic conditions. Policymakers are encouraged to consider transitional support for affected workers and to foster skill development in emerging green industries to balance environmental and employment objectives."}
