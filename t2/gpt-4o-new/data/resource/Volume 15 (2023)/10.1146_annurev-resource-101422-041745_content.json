{"Abstract": "Mathematical programming has emerged as a pivotal tool in analyzing and addressing the multifaceted challenges posed by climate change, particularly within the realms of agriculture and natural resource management. This study explores the application of mathematical programming techniques to model and optimize strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation. By integrating complex datasets and simulating various scenarios, these models provide insights into efficient resource allocation, sustainable agricultural practices, and effective policy-making. The research highlights the potential of mathematical programming to enhance decision-making processes by evaluating the trade-offs and synergies between economic, environmental, and social objectives. Furthermore, the study underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches, combining mathematical programming with ecological and economic theories, to develop robust solutions for climate resilience. The findings suggest that leveraging mathematical programming can significantly contribute to sustainable development goals by fostering adaptive capacities and reducing vulnerabilities in the face of climate change."}
