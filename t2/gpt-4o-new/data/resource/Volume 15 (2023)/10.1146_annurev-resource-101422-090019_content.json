{"Abstract": "The management of crop residues is a critical component in sustainable agriculture, particularly for smallholder farmers. This study examines the economic implications of various crop residue management practices, with a focus on residue burning and its environmental effects. Residue burning, while a quick disposal method, contributes significantly to air pollution and climate change. The research highlights the potential benefits of alternative practices, such as mulching and composting, which can enhance soil fertility and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the adoption of these technologies is often hindered by economic constraints and lack of awareness among smallholder farmers. This paper explores the cost-benefit analysis of different residue management strategies and suggests policy interventions to promote sustainable practices, thereby aligning agricultural productivity with environmental conservation goals."}
