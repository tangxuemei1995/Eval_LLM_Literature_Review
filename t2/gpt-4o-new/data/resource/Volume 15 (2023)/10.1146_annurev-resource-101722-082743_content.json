{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of behavioral economics and neuroeconomics in understanding environmental values and individual decision-making. By integrating insights from these fields, we aim to elucidate how cognitive biases and neural mechanisms influence perceptions and actions regarding environmental issues. The research examines the role of common pool resources and how individuals value and manage these resources, often leading to suboptimal outcomes due to bounded rationality and social preferences. We analyze how neuroeconomic tools, such as neuroimaging, can reveal underlying neural processes that drive environmental decision-making. Furthermore, the study discusses policy implications, suggesting that incorporating behavioral and neuroeconomic insights can enhance the design of interventions aimed at promoting sustainable behaviors. By bridging these disciplines, the research provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and influencing environmental values, ultimately contributing to more effective environmental policies and resource management strategies."}
