{"Abstract": "The implementation of sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) taxes has emerged as a strategic policy tool aimed at curbing the rising prevalence of obesity and other chronic noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) by promoting healthier dietary choices. This study evaluates the effectiveness of these taxes in achieving their intended public health goals and explores potential avenues for enhancing their impact. By analyzing data from various jurisdictions that have enacted SSB taxes, we assess changes in consumption patterns, health outcomes, and revenue generation. Our findings indicate that while SSB taxes have led to a modest reduction in beverage consumption and a corresponding decrease in obesity rates, the overall impact on NCDs remains limited. The study identifies key factors influencing the success of these taxes, including tax design, public awareness, and complementary health policies. We propose a framework for optimizing SSB tax strategies, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive policy integration and targeted public health campaigns. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on effective fiscal measures for promoting healthy diets and reducing the burden of NCDs globally."}
