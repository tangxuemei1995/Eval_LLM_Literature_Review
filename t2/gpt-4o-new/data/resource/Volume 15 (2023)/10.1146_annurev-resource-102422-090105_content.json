{"Abstract": "Agroecology presents a transformative approach to achieving sustainable agriculture and food systems by integrating ecological principles with agricultural practices. This study explores the potential of agroecology to address pressing global challenges such as food security, environmental degradation, and climate change. By examining case studies from diverse geographical regions, the research highlights successful local solutions that have been implemented through multiactor approaches, involving farmers, policymakers, scientists, and civil society. The findings underscore the importance of supportive agricultural and food policies in facilitating the transition from local initiatives to large-scale adoption. Furthermore, the study discusses the role of emerging technologies in enhancing agroecological practices, emphasizing the need for context-specific innovations that respect local knowledge and biodiversity. The research advocates for a holistic agricultural transformation that aligns with sustainable development goals, urging stakeholders to collaborate across multiple scales to foster resilient food systems. Ultimately, this study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting agroecology as a viable pathway for sustainable agricultural development and calls for integrated policy frameworks to enable its widespread implementation."}
