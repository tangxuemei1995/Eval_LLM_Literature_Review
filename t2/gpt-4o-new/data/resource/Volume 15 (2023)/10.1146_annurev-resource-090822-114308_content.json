{"Abstract": "This study investigates whether various estimation methods yield significantly different results in assessing the size of nonobserved or shadow economies. By comparing the MIMIC estimation approaches, micro survey techniques, and the consumption-income gap approach, the research aims to identify potential discrepancies and their implications. Preliminary findings suggest that while each method offers unique insights, they may produce implausible variations in estimated shadow economy sizes due to methodological differences and data limitations. The study highlights the importance of methodological transparency and the need for a standardized framework to enhance comparability across studies. These insights are crucial for policymakers and researchers seeking to understand and address the complexities of shadow economies effectively. Further research is recommended to refine these methods and validate findings across diverse economic contexts."}
