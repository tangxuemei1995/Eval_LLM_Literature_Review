{"Abstract": "The Rigor Revolution in international agricultural research emphasizes the need for robust standards of evidence in impact assessment. This paper explores the evolving methodologies that enhance the precision and reliability of measuring the effects of agricultural research for development. By integrating advanced causal inference techniques and scalable measurement frameworks, the study addresses the challenges of attributing outcomes directly to research interventions. The analysis highlights the importance of context-specific approaches that consider the diverse socio-economic and environmental landscapes in which agricultural innovations are deployed. Furthermore, the paper discusses the implications of these new standards for policy-making and resource allocation, advocating for a paradigm shift towards more rigorous, evidence-based decision-making processes. This revolution in rigor not only aims to improve the credibility of impact assessments but also seeks to maximize the developmental benefits of agricultural research by ensuring that interventions are both effective and scalable across different regions."}
