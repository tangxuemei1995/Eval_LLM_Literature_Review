{"Abstract": "This study investigates the heterogeneous effects of obesity on life expectancy across different global contexts, focusing on both developed and developing countries. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset that spans multiple decades and includes diverse demographic and socioeconomic variables, we analyze how obesity impacts mortality rates and life expectancy. Our findings reveal significant disparities in the effects of obesity on life expectancy between developed and developing nations. In developed countries, where healthcare systems are more robust, the impact of obesity on life expectancy is somewhat mitigated, although still significant. Conversely, in developing countries, the lack of adequate healthcare infrastructure exacerbates the negative effects of obesity, leading to a more pronounced reduction in life expectancy. The study highlights the importance of tailored public health strategies that consider the unique challenges and resources of each region. By understanding these heterogeneous effects, policymakers can better address the global obesity epidemic and its implications for health and mortality, ultimately improving life expectancy outcomes worldwide."}
