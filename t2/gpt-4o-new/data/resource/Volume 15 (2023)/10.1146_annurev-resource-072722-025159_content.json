{"Abstract": "Food loss and waste within agrifood systems pose significant challenges to global food security, economic stability, and environmental sustainability. This study synthesizes current knowledge on the extent, causes, and impacts of food losses across various stages of the value chain, from production to consumption. It highlights the complexity of measuring food loss due to diverse definitions and methodologies, which complicates the assessment of its true scale and impact. Key determinants of food loss include inadequate infrastructure, inefficient supply chain management, and socio-economic factors. The paper reviews interventions aimed at reducing food loss, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches that involve technological innovations, policy reforms, and stakeholder collaboration. By identifying gaps in current research and practice, this study underscores the importance of developing standardized measurement frameworks and targeted strategies to mitigate food loss, thereby enhancing the resilience and efficiency of agrifood systems and contributing to global food security goals."}
