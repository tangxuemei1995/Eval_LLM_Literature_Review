{"Abstract": "This study examines the role of social protection mechanisms, particularly cash transfers, in facilitating rural transformation across Africa. By employing a comprehensive impact evaluation framework, the research investigates how these financial interventions influence income levels, agricultural production, and overall economic development in rural communities. The analysis draws on a diverse array of case studies and empirical data to assess the effectiveness of cash transfers in enhancing the livelihoods of rural populations. Findings suggest that cash transfers significantly contribute to increased household income and improved agricultural productivity, thereby fostering economic resilience and sustainability. Moreover, the study highlights the potential of social protection programs to catalyze broader socio-economic changes, including enhanced access to education and healthcare, which are critical for long-term rural transformation. The research underscores the importance of integrating social protection strategies with broader development policies to maximize their impact. This study provides valuable insights for policymakers and development practitioners aiming to design effective interventions that promote inclusive growth and poverty reduction in rural Africa."}
