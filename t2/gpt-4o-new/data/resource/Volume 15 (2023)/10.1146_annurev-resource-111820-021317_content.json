{"Abstract": "Nutrient pollution from agriculture, primarily due to the overapplication of fertilizers, poses significant environmental and economic challenges. This study examines the economic dimensions of nutrient pollution, focusing on nonpoint-source pollution, which is diffuse and difficult to regulate. The research highlights the externalities associated with agricultural practices, where the costs of environmental degradation are not borne by the producers but by society at large. By analyzing case studies and economic models, the study identifies the inefficiencies in current agricultural practices and the resultant economic impacts on water quality, biodiversity, and public health. The findings suggest that traditional market mechanisms fail to account for these externalities, leading to suboptimal resource allocation. The study advocates for policy interventions, such as taxes on fertilizer use, subsidies for sustainable practices, and the implementation of nutrient trading schemes, to internalize these externalities. Additionally, the research underscores the importance of technological innovations and education in promoting sustainable agricultural practices. By addressing the economic aspects of nutrient pollution, this study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between agriculture and environmental sustainability, offering pathways for mitigating the adverse effects of nutrient pollution."}
