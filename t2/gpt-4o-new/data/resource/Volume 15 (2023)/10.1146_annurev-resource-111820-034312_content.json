{"Abstract": "This study explores the differential impacts of research and development (R&D) lag models in agricultural and industrial sectors, focusing on the dynamics of knowledge stocks and flows. By examining the temporal aspects of R&D adoption and technological change, the research highlights how innovation processes differ between these sectors. The agricultural sector often experiences longer R&D lags due to biological growth cycles and regulatory constraints, whereas the industrial sector benefits from faster innovation cycles driven by technological advancements and market demands. The study employs a comparative analysis of R&D investment patterns, adoption rates, and resultant productivity gains, providing insights into sector-specific challenges and opportunities. Findings suggest that tailored R&D strategies are essential to optimize innovation outcomes, with implications for policy-making and resource allocation. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of how sectoral characteristics influence the pace and effectiveness of technological change, ultimately impacting economic growth and competitiveness."}
