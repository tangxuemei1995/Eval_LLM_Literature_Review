{"Abstract": "Food fraud, encompassing adulteration and mislabeling, arises from asymmetric information and the credence nature of food products. This study examines the causes, including economic incentives and regulatory gaps, and the consequences, such as health risks and economic losses. The role of certification and labeling as deterrence strategies is analyzed, highlighting their limitations due to costly and imperfect enforcement. The research suggests enhancing transparency and accountability through improved regulatory frameworks and technological innovations. By addressing these challenges, the study aims to contribute to more effective deterrence strategies, ensuring food integrity and consumer trust in the global food supply chain."}
