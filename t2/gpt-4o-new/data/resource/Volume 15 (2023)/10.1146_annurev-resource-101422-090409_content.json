{"Abstract": "Food insecurity remains a critical issue in the United States, affecting millions of individuals and families. This study examines the measurement of food insecurity, the economic modeling of its determinants, and the effectiveness of food assistance programs. Utilizing data from national surveys and administrative records, we assess the prevalence and severity of food insecurity across different demographics. The analysis incorporates economic models to identify key factors contributing to food insecurity, including income levels, employment status, and regional disparities. Furthermore, the study evaluates the impact of major food assistance programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the School Breakfast Program (SBP), the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Our findings suggest that these programs play a significant role in mitigating food insecurity and improving nutrition security, particularly among vulnerable populations. However, challenges remain in ensuring equitable access and addressing the root causes of food insecurity. The study concludes with policy recommendations aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of food assistance programs and promoting sustainable food security solutions in the United States."}
