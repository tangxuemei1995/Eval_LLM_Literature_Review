{"Abstract": "Recent advances in causal inference methodologies have significantly enhanced our understanding of the relationship between air pollution and health outcomes. This study explores the integration of natural experiments and epidemiological data to establish more robust causal links. By leveraging integrated science assessments, researchers can better account for confounding variables and biases, leading to more accurate estimations of health impacts. The application of these advanced techniques provides critical insights into the mechanisms by which air pollution affects human health, informing policy decisions and public health interventions. This interdisciplinary approach underscores the importance of combining statistical innovation with comprehensive environmental assessments to address complex public health challenges."}
