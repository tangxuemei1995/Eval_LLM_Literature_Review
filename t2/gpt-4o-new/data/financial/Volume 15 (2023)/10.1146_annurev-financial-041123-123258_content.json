{"Abstract": "This paper explores the limitations and insights that financial economics offers regarding the determination of the social discount rate, a critical component in government project valuation and policy decision-making. The social discount rate is pivotal in assessing the present value of future costs and benefits, influencing budgetary and fair value accounting practices. While financial economics provides robust frameworks for understanding market-based discount rates, its application to the social discount rate is fraught with challenges due to the unique nature of government projects, which often involve non-market goods and intergenerational equity considerations. The paper critically examines the assumptions underlying traditional financial models, such as the government cost of capital, and their applicability to public sector evaluations. It also highlights the need for a more nuanced approach that incorporates ethical and social dimensions, which are often overlooked in conventional financial analyses. By reflecting on these aspects, the study aims to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of how financial economics can inform, yet also limit, the determination of the social discount rate in public policy contexts."}
