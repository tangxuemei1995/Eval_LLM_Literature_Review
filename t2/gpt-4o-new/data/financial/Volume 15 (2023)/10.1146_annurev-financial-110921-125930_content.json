{"Abstract": "The increasing reliance on machine learning algorithms in decision-making processes, such as credit scoring, has raised significant concerns about algorithmic fairness. This study explores the intersection of algorithms and fairness, focusing on the identification and mitigation of biases that may arise in machine learning models. We review various fairness metrics that have been proposed to evaluate and ensure equitable outcomes across different demographic groups. By analyzing the impact of these metrics on credit scoring systems, we highlight the challenges and trade-offs involved in achieving fairness. Our findings suggest that while no single metric can universally guarantee fairness, a combination of approaches tailored to specific contexts can enhance the fairness of algorithmic decisions. This research underscores the importance of continuous monitoring and adaptation of fairness strategies to address evolving societal norms and expectations, ultimately contributing to more equitable and just algorithmic systems."}
