{"Abstract": "This study delves into the complexities surrounding sovereign debt, focusing on the persistent puzzles that challenge conventional economic theories. Sovereign debt, a critical component of global financial systems, often leads to sovereign default, raising questions about the sustainability and management of public debt. The research examines the paradoxes of why countries with high debt levels continue to access international capital markets and the factors influencing their default decisions. By analyzing historical data and employing advanced econometric models, the study aims to provide insights into the mechanisms of sovereign debt accumulation and default, offering policy recommendations to enhance debt sustainability and mitigate the risks of financial crises."}
