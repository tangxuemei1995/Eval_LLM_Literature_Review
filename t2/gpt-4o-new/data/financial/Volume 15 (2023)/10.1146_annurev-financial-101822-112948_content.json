{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate dynamics between missing participants in financial markets and the determination of the social discount rate, emphasizing the roles of borrowing constraints, intergenerational transfers, altruism, and legacy desires. By examining incomplete markets, the research highlights how these factors influence individual and collective decision-making processes regarding future investments and resource allocations. The analysis reveals that borrowing constraints limit market participation, affecting the social discount rate by altering the perceived value of future benefits. Additionally, altruistic behaviors and the desire for legacy shape intergenerational wealth transfers, further impacting discount rate calculations. The findings suggest that incorporating these elements into economic models can provide a more comprehensive understanding of social discount rates, ultimately informing policy decisions aimed at achieving sustainable economic growth and intergenerational equity."}
