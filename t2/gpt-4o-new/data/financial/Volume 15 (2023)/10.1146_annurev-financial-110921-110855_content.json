{"Abstract": "This study explores the dynamics of inflation-adjusted financial instruments, focusing on inflation-indexed bonds, swaps, and derivatives. Utilizing the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) framework, we model the term structure of interest rates to assess the pricing and risk management of these instruments. The research highlights the role of inflation swaps in hedging against inflation risk and examines the break-even inflation rate as a critical indicator for investors. By analyzing market data, we provide insights into the effectiveness of inflation derivatives in portfolio diversification and risk mitigation. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of inflation-linked securities and their impact on financial markets."}
