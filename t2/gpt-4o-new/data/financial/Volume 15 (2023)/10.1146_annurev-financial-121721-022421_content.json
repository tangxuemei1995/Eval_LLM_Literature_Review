{"Abstract": "The social discount rate (SDR) is a pivotal concept in benefit-cost analysis, particularly when evaluating policies with long-term intertemporal and intergenerational impacts. This paper explores the legal and philosophical foundations of the SDR, emphasizing its role in balancing present and future benefits and costs. The study delves into the ethical considerations of discounting future generations' welfare, questioning the moral justification of valuing present benefits over future ones. It examines the legal frameworks that guide the application of SDR in policy-making, highlighting the tension between economic efficiency and equitable intergenerational resource allocation. By analyzing various philosophical perspectives, including utilitarian and deontological approaches, the paper seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the SDR's implications for sustainable development. The findings suggest that while the SDR is a necessary tool for decision-making, its application requires careful consideration of ethical principles to ensure that future generations are not disproportionately disadvantaged. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on how best to integrate legal and philosophical insights into the formulation of discount rates that reflect societal values and priorities."}
