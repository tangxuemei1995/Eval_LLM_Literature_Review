{"Abstract": "This study examines the evolving landscape of initial public offerings (IPOs) and special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), focusing on recent developments and trends. The analysis highlights the increasing popularity of SPACs as an alternative to traditional IPOs, driven by their expedited process and reduced regulatory scrutiny. The research also explores the rise of unicorn companies opting for confidential filings and direct listings, reflecting a shift towards more flexible and cost-effective public market entry strategies. Additionally, the implications of dual-class share structures on corporate governance and investor interests are discussed. By synthesizing current data and case studies, this paper provides insights into the strategic considerations influencing companies' choices between IPOs and SPACs in the contemporary financial environment."}
