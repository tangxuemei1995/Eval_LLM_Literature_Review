{"Abstract": "This study examines the intricate relationship between inflation and asset returns, focusing on risk premia and bond return predictability. By analyzing historical data, we explore how inflationary pressures influence asset performance, particularly during periods of stagflation. The research highlights the role of monetary policy in shaping investor expectations and asset pricing. Our findings suggest that inflation significantly impacts risk premia, with implications for bond market strategies. The study provides insights into the predictive power of inflation indicators for bond returns, offering valuable guidance for investors and policymakers in navigating inflationary environments. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of inflation's role in financial markets."}
