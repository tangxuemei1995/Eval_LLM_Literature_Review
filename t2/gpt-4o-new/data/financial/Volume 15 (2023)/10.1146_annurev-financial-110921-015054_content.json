{"Abstract": "The transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to alternative short-term rate benchmarks marks a significant shift in global financial markets. This paper examines the post-LIBOR landscape, focusing on the adoption and implications of new benchmarks such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in the United States and the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor) in Europe. These risk-free rates are designed to provide a more stable and reliable foundation for interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments. However, the transition has also spurred the development of credit-sensitive rates like Ameribor, Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY), and Across-the-Curve Credit Spread Index (AXI), which aim to capture credit risk more effectively. The study analyzes the impact of these benchmarks on market liquidity, pricing, and risk management practices. It also explores the challenges and opportunities presented by the coexistence of risk-free and credit-sensitive rates in the financial ecosystem. By evaluating the effectiveness and adoption of these new benchmarks, the paper provides insights into the evolving dynamics of interest rate markets in the post-LIBOR era."}
