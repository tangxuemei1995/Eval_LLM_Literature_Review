{"Abstract": "This study explores the evolving landscape of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) with a focus on mitigating externalities through responsible shareholder mandates and sustainable finance. The research examines how these mandates influence corporate strategies, particularly in the context of decarbonization efforts. By analyzing the role of 'greeniums'—the premium investors are willing to pay for green bonds—this paper highlights the financial incentives driving corporations towards sustainable practices. The findings suggest that responsible shareholder mandates can significantly impact corporate behavior, encouraging a shift towards more sustainable business models. Furthermore, the study underscores the importance of integrating CSR into corporate governance to address environmental challenges effectively. This research contributes to the understanding of how financial mechanisms and shareholder activism can promote corporate decarbonization, ultimately fostering a more sustainable economic environment."}
