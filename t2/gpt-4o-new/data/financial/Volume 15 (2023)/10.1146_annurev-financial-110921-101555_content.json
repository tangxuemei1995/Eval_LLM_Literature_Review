{"Abstract": "Climate stress testing has emerged as a critical tool for assessing the resilience of financial systems in the face of climate-related risks. This study explores the integration of climate risk into financial stability frameworks, emphasizing the importance of systemic risk assessment. By simulating various climate scenarios, including extreme weather events and long-term environmental changes, financial institutions can evaluate potential impacts on asset values, credit risk, and overall market stability. The research highlights the necessity for robust methodologies that incorporate both physical and transition risks associated with climate change. It also underscores the role of regulatory bodies in mandating climate stress tests to ensure that financial institutions are adequately prepared for potential disruptions. The findings suggest that while significant progress has been made, challenges remain in standardizing approaches and data availability. Furthermore, the study advocates for enhanced collaboration between financial institutions, regulators, and climate scientists to refine models and improve predictive accuracy. Ultimately, climate stress testing is positioned as a vital component in safeguarding financial stability, enabling institutions to proactively manage risks and contribute to a more resilient economic system in the face of escalating climate threats."}
