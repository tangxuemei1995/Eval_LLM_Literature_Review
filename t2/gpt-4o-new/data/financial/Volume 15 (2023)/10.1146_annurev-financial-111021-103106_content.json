{"Abstract": "The integration of microdata into macro-finance research has emerged as a pivotal approach to enhance the understanding of economic phenomena. This paper explores methodologies for effectively utilizing microdata to address macroeconomic questions, focusing on the challenges of identification and aggregation. By leveraging granular data, researchers can uncover heterogeneities and causal relationships that are often obscured in aggregate data. The paper discusses advanced econometric techniques that facilitate the identification of causal effects, such as instrumental variables and natural experiments, which are crucial for deriving robust macroeconomic insights from micro-level observations. Furthermore, it examines strategies for aggregating microdata to construct macroeconomic indicators that reflect underlying economic dynamics more accurately. The paper also highlights the potential of microdata to improve policy evaluation and forecasting by providing a more nuanced understanding of economic agents' behavior. Through case studies and empirical examples, the paper demonstrates the transformative impact of microdata on macro-finance, advocating for its broader adoption in economic research and policy analysis."}
