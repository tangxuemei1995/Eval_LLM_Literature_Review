{"Abstract": "This study revisits pari-mutuel betting markets, focusing on racetracks and lotteries, to evaluate their efficiency and explore optimization strategies. By employing stochastic programming models, we analyze the dynamics of betting markets, particularly addressing the favorite-longshot bias. Our findings suggest that while racetrack betting markets exhibit certain inefficiencies, strategic approaches can enhance bettors' outcomes. The research further examines lottery strategies, providing insights into their operational mechanisms and potential for optimization. This comprehensive analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of the underlying factors influencing market behavior, offering valuable implications for both bettors and market regulators aiming to improve market efficiency and fairness."}
