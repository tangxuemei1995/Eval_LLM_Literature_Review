{"Abstract": "This study examines banking crises through a historical lens, analyzing the recurring patterns and underlying causes that have shaped financial systems over centuries. By focusing on the role of financial intermediation and the critical function of the lender of last resort, the research highlights how these elements have influenced financial stability during periods of economic turmoil. The analysis delves into the impact of leverage on banking systems, identifying how excessive risk-taking has often precipitated crises. Historical lessons are drawn from past episodes, providing insights into the effectiveness of policy responses and regulatory frameworks in mitigating the adverse effects of banking crises. The findings underscore the importance of robust financial oversight and adaptive policy measures to enhance resilience against future disruptions, contributing to a deeper understanding of the dynamics of banking crises and their implications for modern financial systems."}
