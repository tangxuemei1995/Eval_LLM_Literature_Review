{"Abstract": "This study explores the transformative role of smart contracts in the burgeoning field of decentralized finance (DeFi). By leveraging blockchain technology, smart contracts facilitate automated, trustless transactions, underpinning decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and protocols for loanable funds (PLFs). The research highlights Ethereum's pivotal role as a foundational platform for DeFi applications, enabling the creation and exchange of tokens without intermediaries. The paper examines the implications of these technologies for financial inclusion, security, and efficiency, while also addressing challenges such as scalability and regulatory compliance. Through a comprehensive analysis, this work contributes to understanding the potential and limitations of DeFi in reshaping global financial systems."}
