{"Abstract": "This study examines the inadequacies in current public discounting systems, particularly in the context of environmental policy and carbon pricing. Discounting, a critical component of cost-benefit analysis, often fails to adequately account for long-term risks and uncertainties associated with climate change. The research highlights the need for risk-adjusted discount rates that better reflect the potential future impacts of carbon emissions. By integrating more robust risk adjustment mechanisms, policymakers can improve the accuracy of economic evaluations related to environmental projects. The paper proposes a framework for recalibrating discount rates to incorporate the social cost of carbon, thereby aligning economic incentives with sustainable development goals. This approach aims to enhance the effectiveness of public policies in mitigating climate change by ensuring that long-term environmental risks are appropriately valued in economic decision-making processes. The findings underscore the importance of revising discounting methodologies to support more informed and responsible policy decisions."}
