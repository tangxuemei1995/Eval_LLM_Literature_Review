{"Abstract": "The social discount rate (SDR) is a pivotal concept in evaluating government projects and public investments, particularly those with long-term impacts such as climate change mitigation. This introduction to the ARFE theme on the SDR explores its role in determining the present value of future costs and benefits, influencing decisions on public policy and investment. The SDR is crucial in assessing the cost of carbon and other environmental externalities, as it reflects intergenerational trade-offs and ethical considerations about the welfare of future generations. This theme examines the theoretical underpinnings of the SDR, its application in various governmental contexts, and the debates surrounding its appropriate level. By integrating insights from economics, ethics, and environmental science, this collection aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the SDR's implications for sustainable development and policy-making, highlighting the need for a balanced approach to intertemporal equity and efficiency."}
