{"Abstract": "This study explores the integration of nonlinear dynamics into macro-finance models, specifically focusing on dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) frameworks. By incorporating endogenous jump risk and financial constraints, the research addresses systemic risk and liquidity challenges within the economy. The nonlinear approach allows for a more accurate representation of economic fluctuations and financial instability, providing insights into the complex interactions between macroeconomic variables and financial markets. The findings suggest that traditional linear models may underestimate the impact of financial shocks, highlighting the importance of considering nonlinearities in policy formulation and risk assessment. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of macro-financial linkages."}
