{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of fiscal policy and asset pricing by examining the term structure of government debt and its implications for fiscal capacity. We analyze how debt maturity influences the convenience yield, a premium investors are willing to pay for holding government securities. Our findings suggest that fiscal policy decisions, particularly those related to debt issuance and maturity, significantly impact the term structure and, consequently, asset prices. By integrating fiscal capacity into asset pricing models, we provide a nuanced understanding of how government debt dynamics affect financial markets, offering insights for policymakers and investors navigating the complexities of fiscal and monetary interactions."}
