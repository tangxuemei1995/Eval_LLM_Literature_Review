{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical role of epidemiological models in understanding and forecasting disease dynamics. This study reviews various modeling approaches, including compartmental models, agent-based models, and machine learning techniques, highlighting their applications in predicting infection spread, healthcare demand, and intervention outcomes. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each model type, emphasizing the importance of accurate parameter estimation and real-time data integration. The review also explores the challenges of uncertainty quantification and the need for adaptive models that can respond to evolving epidemiological data. By synthesizing recent advancements, this work aims to inform future model development and enhance the effectiveness of public health strategies in managing infectious disease outbreaks."}
