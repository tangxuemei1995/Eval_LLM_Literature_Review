{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted global fixed income markets, revealing vulnerabilities and prompting unprecedented policy responses. This study examines the dynamics of fixed income markets during the crisis, focusing on liquidity disruptions, yield volatility, and credit risk re-evaluation. Utilizing JEL classifications G1 and G2, the analysis highlights the interplay between market microstructure and macroeconomic factors. The research identifies key drivers of market stress, including investor behavior shifts and central bank interventions. Findings suggest that while policy measures stabilized markets temporarily, underlying structural weaknesses remain. This paper contributes to understanding the resilience of fixed income markets and informs future regulatory frameworks to mitigate similar crises."}
