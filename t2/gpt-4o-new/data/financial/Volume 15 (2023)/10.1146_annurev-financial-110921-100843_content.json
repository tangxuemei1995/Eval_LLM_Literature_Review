{"Abstract": "This study delves into the concept of swing pricing as a mechanism for liquidity management in mutual funds, addressing the challenges of liquidity transformation and mitigating the adverse effects of fire sales. Swing pricing allows funds to adjust their net asset value in response to significant investor flows, thereby protecting long-term investors from the costs associated with large redemptions. The theoretical framework presented explores the conditions under which swing pricing can effectively reduce the liquidity mismatch inherent in mutual funds. Empirical evidence is drawn from a comprehensive dataset of mutual funds implementing swing pricing, highlighting its impact on fund performance, investor behavior, and market stability. The findings suggest that swing pricing not only curtails the need for fire sales but also enhances overall fund resilience during periods of market stress. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on optimal liquidity management strategies in the mutual fund industry."}
