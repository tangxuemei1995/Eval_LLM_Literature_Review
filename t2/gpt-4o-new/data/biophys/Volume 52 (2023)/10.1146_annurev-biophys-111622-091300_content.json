{"Abstract": "High-resolution single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a transformative tool for elucidating the 3D structures of macromolecules and protein complexes at near-atomic resolution. This technique offers significant advantages over traditional methods, such as X-ray crystallography, by allowing the study of biomolecules in their native states without the need for crystallization. Recent advancements in detector technology and image processing algorithms have pushed the boundaries of achievable resolution, enabling detailed insights into molecular mechanisms. However, challenges remain, including the correction of optical aberrations and the need for improved sample preparation techniques to enhance image quality and resolution. This review explores the current prospects of cryo-EM, addressing its limitations and potential future developments in achieving true atomic resolution."}
