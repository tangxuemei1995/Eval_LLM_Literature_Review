{"Abstract": "The expanded central dogma of molecular biology now encompasses the innovative realms of synthetic biology, where genome resynthesis and orthogonal biosystems redefine genetic manipulation. This study explores the integration of synthetic genetics, focusing on the creation and application of xenonucleic acids (XNA) and unnatural base pairs, which enable the construction of novel genetic systems. These advancements facilitate the development of orthogonal biosystems that operate independently of natural biological processes, offering unprecedented control over genetic expression and function. By harnessing genome synthesis technologies, researchers can design and implement bespoke genetic circuits, paving the way for breakthroughs in biotechnology and medicine. This paper reviews current methodologies, challenges, and future directions in the field, highlighting the transformative potential of these synthetic approaches in expanding the boundaries of genetic engineering."}
