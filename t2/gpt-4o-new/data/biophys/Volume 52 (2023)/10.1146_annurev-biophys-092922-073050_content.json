{"Abstract": "Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins are pivotal in immune responses, forming resistosomes and inflammasomes upon activation. This study delves into the structural assembly and architecture of these complexes, focusing on the mechanisms of autoinhibition and ligand recognition. We explore the transition from inactive to active states, highlighting the role of NLRs in forming NADase holoenzymes and resistosome channels. The findings reveal intricate molecular interactions that govern the activation and function of these immune complexes, providing insights into their roles in pathogen defense and inflammatory diseases. Understanding these processes offers potential therapeutic targets for modulating immune responses and treating related disorders."}
