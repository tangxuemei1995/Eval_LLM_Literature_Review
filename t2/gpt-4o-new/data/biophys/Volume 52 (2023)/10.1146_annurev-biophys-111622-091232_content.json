{"Abstract": "ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are integral membrane proteins that play a crucial role in the translocation of various substrates across cellular membranes, impacting processes such as drug extrusion and lipid homeostasis. These transporters are implicated in numerous human diseases, including cystic fibrosis and multidrug resistance in cancer, making them significant targets for therapeutic intervention. Recent advancements in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have provided unprecedented insights into the structural dynamics and mechanistic functions of human ABC transporters. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the architecture of these transporters, highlighting the conformational changes associated with ATP binding and hydrolysis that drive substrate translocation. We discuss the implications of these structural insights for understanding the molecular basis of transporter-related diseases and for the development of novel pharmacological strategies. By elucidating the structure-function relationships of ABC transporters, this research underscores the potential for cryo-EM to advance our understanding of membrane protein mechanisms and to inform the design of targeted therapies for conditions linked to transporter dysfunction."}
