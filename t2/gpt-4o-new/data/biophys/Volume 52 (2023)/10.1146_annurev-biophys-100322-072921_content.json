{"Abstract": "Ball-and-chain inactivation is a critical mechanism regulating the function of potassium channels, particularly in voltage-gated and Ca2+-activated K+ channels. This process, also known as N-type inactivation, involves a cytoplasmic domain, the 'ball,' tethered by a flexible 'chain,' which occludes the channel pore following activation. This inactivation mechanism is essential for the rapid termination of ion flow, contributing to the precise control of electrical signaling in neurons and muscle cells. Recent studies have elucidated the structural dynamics of the ball-and-chain model, revealing its role in modulating channel kinetics and influencing cellular excitability. Comparisons with Na+ channels, which also exhibit similar inactivation processes, highlight the evolutionary conservation and functional significance of this mechanism. Understanding the molecular basis of ball-and-chain inactivation provides insights into the pathophysiology of channelopathies and offers potential therapeutic targets for disorders involving dysfunctional ion channel activity. This review synthesizes current knowledge and identifies future research directions in the field."}
