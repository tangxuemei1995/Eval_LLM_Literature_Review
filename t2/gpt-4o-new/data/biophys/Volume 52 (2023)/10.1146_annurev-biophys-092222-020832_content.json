{"Abstract": "The organization and encapsulation of multienzyme systems are pivotal in enhancing metabolic efficiency and specificity, offering significant potential in metabolic engineering. This study explores both theoretical frameworks and practical applications of multienzyme complexes, focusing on protein scaffolds and bacterial microcompartments. Protein scaffolds provide a modular approach to enzyme organization, facilitating substrate channeling and reducing diffusion limitations. Bacterial microcompartments, on the other hand, offer a natural encapsulation strategy, creating distinct microenvironments that can optimize reaction conditions and protect sensitive intermediates. By integrating these strategies, we can design synthetic pathways with improved yields and reduced by-products. This paper reviews recent advances in the field, highlighting innovative techniques for scaffold design and compartmentalization, and discusses their implications for industrial biotechnology. The findings underscore the importance of structural and functional considerations in the development of efficient multienzyme systems for diverse applications."}
