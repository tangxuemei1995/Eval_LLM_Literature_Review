{"Abstract": "Mitochondrial ion channels play a pivotal role in cellular homeostasis and energy metabolism, influencing processes such as ATP production, apoptosis, and calcium signaling. This review explores the diverse types of ion channels present in the mitochondrial membranes, including calcium channels, potassium channels, chloride channels, and the mitochondrial megachannel, also known as the permeability transition pore. Calcium channels are crucial for regulating mitochondrial calcium uptake, impacting metabolic activity and cell death pathways. Potassium channels contribute to mitochondrial volume regulation and protection against ischemic damage. Chloride channels are involved in maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential and ionic balance. Additionally, the mitochondrial megachannel is implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial permeability transition, a key event in apoptosis. The role of porins, which facilitate the transport of metabolites across the outer mitochondrial membrane, is also discussed. Understanding the function and regulation of these channels is essential for elucidating their contributions to mitochondrial physiology and their potential as therapeutic targets in various diseases."}
