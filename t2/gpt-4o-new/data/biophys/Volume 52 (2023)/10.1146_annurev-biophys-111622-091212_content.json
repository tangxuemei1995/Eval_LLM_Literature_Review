{"Abstract": "Quantitative Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) has emerged as a pivotal technique in super-resolution nanoscopy, enabling unprecedented insights into cellular structures at the nanoscale. This method surpasses the diffraction limit of conventional microscopy by precisely localizing individual fluorescent molecules, thus facilitating the quantitative analysis of complex biological systems. Recent advancements in SMLM have enhanced its applicability in quantitative cell biology, allowing for the detailed mapping of molecular distributions and interactions within cells. This review highlights the latest developments in SMLM techniques, including improvements in localization precision, data analysis algorithms, and their integration with complementary imaging modalities. The potential of SMLM to transform our understanding of cellular processes through quantitative measurements is underscored, paving the way for novel discoveries in molecular and cellular biology."}
