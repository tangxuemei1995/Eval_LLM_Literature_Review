{"Abstract": "Rhodopsin, a prototypical G proteinâ€“coupled receptor (GPCR), plays a crucial role in vision by converting light into a biochemical signal. This study elucidates the activation mechanism of rhodopsin, focusing on its structural dynamics. Using advanced spectroscopic and crystallographic techniques, we reveal conformational changes upon photon absorption, leading to the activation of the G protein transducin. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of retinal isomerization and subsequent helix movements in signal transduction. Understanding rhodopsin's activation provides insights into GPCR function, offering potential therapeutic targets for visual disorders and expanding knowledge of GPCR-mediated signaling pathways."}
