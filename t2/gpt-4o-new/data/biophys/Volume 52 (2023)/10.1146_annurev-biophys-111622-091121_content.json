{"Abstract": "Graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising candidates for biomolecule sensing due to their exceptional specific surface area (SSA) and tunable electronic properties, such as density of states (DOS). These materials, when integrated into field effect transistor (FET) configurations, exhibit high sensitivity and selectivity in detecting biomolecules. The unique electronic properties of 2D materials, influenced by defects and edge states, play a crucial role in enhancing sensor performance. Impedance models are employed to understand the interaction mechanisms between biomolecules and the sensor surface, providing insights into optimizing sensor design. However, the variability in material quality and device fabrication necessitates the development of standardized protocols to ensure reproducibility and reliability in sensor performance. This review highlights recent advancements in the use of graphene and 2D materials for biomolecule sensing, emphasizing the need for standardization to fully realize their potential in practical applications."}
