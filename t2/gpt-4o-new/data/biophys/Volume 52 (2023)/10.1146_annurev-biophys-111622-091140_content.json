{"Abstract": "Hybrid Quantum Mechanical/Molecular Mechanical (QM/MM) methods have emerged as powerful tools for investigating energy transduction in biomolecular machines. These methods enable the detailed study of complex processes such as proton and electron transfers, and nucleotide hydrolysis, which are fundamental to the function of biomolecular machines. By integrating quantum mechanical accuracy with the efficiency of molecular mechanics, QM/MM approaches provide insights into the mechanistic pathways and energetic landscapes of these processes. This paper reviews recent advancements in QM/MM methodologies and their applications in elucidating the intricate energy transduction mechanisms in biomolecular systems. The findings underscore the potential of QM/MM techniques to enhance our understanding of the molecular basis of energy conversion in biological systems, paving the way for novel biomimetic applications."}
