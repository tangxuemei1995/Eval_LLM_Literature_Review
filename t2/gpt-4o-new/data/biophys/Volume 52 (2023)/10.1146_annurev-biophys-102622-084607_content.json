{"Abstract": "The accurate prediction of protein structures and their interactions is a pivotal challenge in computational biology, with significant implications for drug discovery and understanding biological processes. This study critically assesses the current methodologies employed in predicting the three-dimensional structures of proteins and protein complexes, focusing on the contributions of the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) and the Critical Assessment of Predicted Interactions (CAPRI) initiatives. These biennial competitions have driven advancements in the field by benchmarking the performance of various prediction algorithms. Recent developments in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning techniques, have revolutionized the accuracy of these predictions, as evidenced by the success of models like AlphaFold. This review synthesizes the progress made in the field, evaluates the strengths and limitations of existing methods, and discusses future directions for improving prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. The integration of AI-driven approaches with traditional methods holds promise for further breakthroughs in understanding protein interactions."}
