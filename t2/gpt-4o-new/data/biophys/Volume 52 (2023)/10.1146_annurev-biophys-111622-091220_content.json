{"Abstract": "The study investigates the mechanisms of protein diffusion along protein and DNA lattices, emphasizing the influence of electrostatic interactions and intrinsically disordered regions. Proteins often locate their target sites on DNA or microtubules through a combination of three-dimensional diffusion and one-dimensional sliding along the lattice. Electrostatic forces play a crucial role in modulating the diffusion coefficient, as they can either facilitate or hinder the sliding process depending on the charge distribution of the protein and the lattice. Additionally, intrinsically disordered regions of proteins contribute to the dynamic interaction with the lattice, potentially enhancing the search efficiency by allowing conformational flexibility. This research employs a combination of computational modeling and experimental validation to elucidate the interplay between electrostatics and disordered regions in protein diffusion. The findings provide insights into the fundamental processes of cellular function, with implications for understanding protein-DNA interactions, microtubule dynamics, and the development of therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways."}
