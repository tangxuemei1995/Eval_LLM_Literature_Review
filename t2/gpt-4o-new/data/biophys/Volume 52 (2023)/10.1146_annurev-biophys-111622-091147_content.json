{"Abstract": "The ribosome, a pivotal molecular machine in cellular translation, presents a formidable challenge for computational simulations due to its size and complexity. Recent advancements in molecular dynamics and computer simulations have enabled more detailed studies of ribosomal function and interactions. This paper reviews the integration of cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data with simulation techniques to enhance the accuracy of ribosomal models. By simulating the dynamic processes of translation, researchers can gain insights into the mechanisms of antibiotic action and resistance. The synergy between cryo-EM and molecular dynamics offers a powerful approach to unravel the intricate workings of the ribosome, providing a platform for the development of novel antibiotics. This study underscores the potential of computational methods to address biological questions at the molecular level, particularly in the context of complex biomolecular systems."}
