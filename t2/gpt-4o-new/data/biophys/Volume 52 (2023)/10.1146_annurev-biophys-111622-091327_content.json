{"Abstract": "Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is revolutionizing cell biology by providing unprecedented insights into the molecular architecture of cells in their native state. This technique enables in situ structural biology, allowing researchers to visualize complex cellular environments at near-atomic resolution. By integrating cryo-ET with quantitative cell biology and biophysical modeling, scientists can elucidate the spatial organization and interactions of macromolecular complexes within cells. This approach not only enhances our understanding of cellular processes but also facilitates the development of predictive models of cellular behavior. Cryo-ET thus represents a powerful tool for advancing our knowledge of cell biology, bridging the gap between molecular structures and cellular function."}
