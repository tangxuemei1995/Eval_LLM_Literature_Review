{"Abstract": "The study of protein dynamics is crucial for understanding biological processes at the molecular level. Emerging time-resolved X-ray diffraction techniques, such as serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX), have revolutionized the ability to capture transient states of proteins in real-time. These methods enable the observation of protein mechanics and structural changes induced by external stimuli, such as electric fields, with unprecedented temporal resolution. This review highlights recent advancements in time-resolved X-ray crystallography, focusing on their application to elucidate excited states of proteins. By leveraging ultra-fast X-ray pulses, researchers can now visualize the dynamic processes that govern protein function, providing insights into mechanisms that were previously inaccessible. The integration of these techniques with computational modeling and advanced data analysis tools further enhances the understanding of protein behavior under various conditions. This progress paves the way for novel applications in drug discovery and the design of biomimetic materials, offering new avenues for scientific exploration."}
