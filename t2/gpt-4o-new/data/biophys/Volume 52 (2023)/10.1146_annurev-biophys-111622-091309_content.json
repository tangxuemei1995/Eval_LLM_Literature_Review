{"Abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a critical cellular organelle responsible for the proper folding and maturation of proteins. This study investigates the coordinated action of molecular chaperones Hsp40, Hsp70, and Hsp90 in maintaining protein quality control within the ER. These chaperones form a dynamic network that facilitates protein folding, prevents aggregation, and targets misfolded proteins for degradation. Hsp40 acts as a co-chaperone, enhancing the ATPase activity of Hsp70, which in turn stabilizes nascent polypeptides. Hsp90 further refines the folding process, ensuring functional conformation. Our findings reveal that the interplay between these chaperones is crucial for cellular homeostasis, as disruptions can lead to protein misfolding diseases. Advanced biochemical assays and imaging techniques were employed to elucidate the mechanistic pathways and interactions among these chaperones. This research underscores the importance of the Hsp40-Hsp70-Hsp90 system in ER-associated protein quality control and highlights potential therapeutic targets for related disorders."}
