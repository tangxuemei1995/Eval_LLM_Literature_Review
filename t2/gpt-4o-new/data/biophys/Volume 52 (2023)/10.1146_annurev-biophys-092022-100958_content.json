{"Abstract": "Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has revolutionized structural biology by enabling high-resolution visualization of viruses in their native states. The integration of cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling has further enhanced sample preparation, allowing for precise thinning of cellular specimens. This technological advancement has led to a surge in in situ virological discoveries, providing unprecedented insights into viral architecture and host interactions. Cryo-ET's ability to capture dynamic processes at near-atomic resolution is transforming our understanding of viral pathogenesis and informing the development of novel therapeutic strategies."}
