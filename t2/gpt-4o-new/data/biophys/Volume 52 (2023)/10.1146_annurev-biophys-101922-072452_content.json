{"Abstract": "The ribosome is a complex molecular machine responsible for translating mRNA sequences into functional proteins, a process that is finely regulated by various factors including tRNA, EF-Tu, and EF-G. This study explores the mechanisms of mRNA decoding and recoding, focusing on frameshifting and stop codon readthrough events. These phenomena are critical for understanding how the ribosome maintains fidelity and flexibility during translation. We employ kinetic analyses to elucidate the roles of elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G in modulating the accuracy and efficiency of translation. Our findings reveal that specific interactions between tRNA and the ribosome can induce frameshifting, while certain sequences promote stop codon readthrough, highlighting the dynamic nature of mRNA translation. This research advances our understanding of the molecular intricacies of ribosomal function and its implications for protein synthesis and cellular regulation."}
