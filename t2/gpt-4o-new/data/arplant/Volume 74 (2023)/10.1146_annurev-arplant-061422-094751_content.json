{"Abstract": "This study explores the engineering principles underlying plant forms and functions, emphasizing the biomechanics of plant structures. By examining the structureâ€“function relationship, we identify how plants utilize bilayer and slender body designs to optimize their growth and survival. The concept of self-similarity is highlighted as a key factor in the efficient scaling of plant structures, allowing for adaptability and resilience. Through a detailed analysis of biological design, we reveal how plants achieve mechanical stability and functional efficiency. This research provides insights into the intricate balance between form and function in plant biology, offering potential applications in biomimetic engineering and sustainable design practices. Our findings underscore the sophistication of natural engineering in plant systems."}
