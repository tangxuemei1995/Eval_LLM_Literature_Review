{"Abstract": "Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are pivotal in orchestrating plant development, adaptation, and evolutionary processes by modulating gene expression. These non-coding DNA sequences, located proximal to genes, interact with transcription factors and chromatin modifiers to regulate transcriptional activity. This review synthesizes current insights into the role of CREs in plant development, highlighting their influence on spatial and temporal gene expression patterns essential for organogenesis and differentiation. Furthermore, we explore how CREs contribute to plant adaptation by mediating stress response pathways, enabling plants to cope with environmental challenges such as drought, salinity, and pathogen attack. The evolutionary significance of CREs is underscored by their capacity to drive phenotypic diversity and speciation through subtle modifications in gene regulatory networks. Advances in genomic technologies, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and CRISPR-based editing, have facilitated the identification and functional characterization of CREs, offering new avenues for crop improvement and sustainable agriculture. Understanding CRE dynamics is crucial for harnessing plant resilience and productivity in changing climates."}
