{"Abstract": "De novo domestication, facilitated by advances in genome editing technologies, offers unprecedented opportunities to enhance crop resilience and productivity in the face of climate change. This approach allows for the targeted modification of wild plant species, harnessing desirable traits such as drought tolerance and disease resistance, while maintaining genetic diversity. By integrating insights from plant developmental genetics and ethnobotany, researchers can identify and manipulate key genetic pathways to accelerate the domestication process. However, the power of genome editing also presents significant ethical and ecological challenges. Potential risks include unintended consequences on ecosystems and the erosion of traditional agricultural practices. This paper explores the dual nature of de novo domestication, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach that considers both the scientific potential and the socio-cultural implications. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and robust regulatory frameworks, the benefits of genome editing can be maximized while minimizing its perils, ensuring sustainable agricultural development."}
