{"Abstract": "Plant volatiles play a crucial role in mediating ecological signaling, influencing interactions among plants, herbivores, and pollinators. This study explores the spatial and temporal dynamics of volatile-mediated signaling, emphasizing the environmental chemistry and physics that govern these processes. By examining the distribution patterns of plant volatiles, we identify key factors that affect their dispersion and reception, such as wind patterns, temperature, and humidity. Temporal dynamics are also considered, highlighting how diurnal and seasonal variations impact volatile emissions and their ecological roles. Despite significant advances, research gaps remain in understanding the precise mechanisms by which plant volatiles influence ecological interactions. This review synthesizes current knowledge and proposes future research directions to address these gaps, aiming to enhance our understanding of the complex interplay between plant volatiles and their environment. Ultimately, this work underscores the importance of integrating multidisciplinary approaches to unravel the intricate web of ecological signaling mediated by plant volatiles."}
