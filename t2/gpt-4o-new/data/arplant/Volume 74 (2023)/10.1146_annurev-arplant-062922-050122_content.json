{"Abstract": "The BAHD acyltransferase gene family, encompassing hydroxycinnamoyltransferases (HCTs), plays a pivotal role in plant metabolism, particularly in the phenylpropanoid pathway. This pathway is crucial for the biosynthesis of a diverse array of secondary metabolites, including acylsugars, esters, and amides, which are vital for plant defense, growth, and adaptation. Recent studies have highlighted the evolutionary significance of BAHD acyltransferases in land plants, underscoring their contribution to the diversification of plant chemical defenses and ecological interactions. The functional versatility of these enzymes is attributed to their ability to catalyze the transfer of acyl groups to a wide range of acceptor molecules, facilitating the synthesis of complex compounds. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the structural and functional diversity of the BAHD family, exploring their evolutionary trajectories and expanding roles in plant biology. Understanding these mechanisms offers insights into plant resilience and potential applications in agriculture and biotechnology."}
