{"Abstract": "The increasing salinity of arable land poses a significant threat to global food security, necessitating the development of salt-tolerant crops. This paper explores the potential of leveraging crop wild relatives and neodomestication to enhance salinity tolerance in staple crops. By integrating advanced genetic modification techniques, such as CRISPR-Cas9, with traditional breeding methods, researchers aim to improve crop yield under saline conditions. The study highlights recent breakthroughs in identifying key genetic markers associated with salinity tolerance and discusses the role of biotechnological innovations in accelerating the breeding process. Furthermore, the paper examines the socio-economic implications of deploying salt-tolerant crops, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to address regulatory, ethical, and market challenges. Ultimately, the research underscores the urgency of delivering salt-tolerant crops to ensure sustainable agricultural practices and secure food supplies in the face of climate change and soil degradation. This comprehensive approach promises to transform agricultural resilience and productivity in saline-prone regions."}
