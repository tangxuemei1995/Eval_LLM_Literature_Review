{"Abstract": "Plant glutamate receptor-like (GLR) ion channels are pivotal components in the intricate network of plant signaling, bridging the gap between structural integrity and dynamic cellular communication. These channels, homologous to animal ionotropic glutamate receptors, are integral to the modulation of excitability and cellâ€“cell communication in plants. This review delves into the multifaceted roles and mechanisms of GLRs, emphasizing their contribution to calcium transport and signaling, which are crucial for various physiological processes. GLRs facilitate the influx of calcium ions, thereby influencing electric signaling and the generation of action potentials, which are essential for rapid systemic responses to environmental stimuli. Furthermore, GLRs are implicated in amino acid signaling, particularly through their interaction with glutathione and other signaling molecules, underscoring their role in metabolic regulation and stress responses. The structural aspects of GLRs, including their ligand-binding domains and ion channel architecture, are explored to elucidate their functional diversity and specificity. Recent advances in molecular biology and electrophysiology have shed light on the complex regulatory mechanisms governing GLR activity, including post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions. This synthesis of signaling and structural insights provides a comprehensive understanding of how GLRs integrate external signals with internal cellular responses, thereby maintaining homeostasis and adaptability in plants. By highlighting the convergence of signaling pathways mediated by GLRs, this review underscores their potential as targets for genetic and biotechnological interventions aimed at enhancing plant resilience and productivity in the face of environmental challenges."}
