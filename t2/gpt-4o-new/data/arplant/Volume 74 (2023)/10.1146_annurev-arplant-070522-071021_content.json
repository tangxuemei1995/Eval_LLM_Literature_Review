{"Abstract": "Invasive plants pose significant ecological challenges, often outcompeting native species and altering ecosystem dynamics. This study explores the factors contributing to the success of alien plants, focusing on biotic interactions, competition, and ecosystem invasibility. We examine the role of functional traits that enhance invasiveness, such as rapid growth, high reproductive output, and adaptability to diverse environmental conditions. The research highlights how these traits enable non-native plants to exploit available resources more efficiently than native species. Additionally, we investigate the influence of biotic interactions, including mutualisms and enemy release, which can facilitate the establishment and spread of invasive species. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for predicting potential invasions and developing effective management strategies. Our findings underscore the importance of considering both intrinsic plant traits and extrinsic ecosystem characteristics to mitigate the impacts of invasive plants on biodiversity and ecosystem function."}
