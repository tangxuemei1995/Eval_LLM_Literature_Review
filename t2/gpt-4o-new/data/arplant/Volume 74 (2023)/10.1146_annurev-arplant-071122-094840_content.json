{"Abstract": "Optogenetic methods have emerged as a transformative approach in plant biology, offering precise control over cellular processes through light-responsive proteins. This review explores the integration of plant optogenetics, focusing on the utilization of photoreceptors, rhodopsins, and optoswitches to manipulate plant physiology and development. Photoreceptors, such as phytochromes and cryptochromes, are harnessed to modulate gene expression and signaling pathways, providing insights into plant responses to environmental stimuli. Rhodopsins, traditionally studied in microbial systems, are now being adapted to plants, enabling the regulation of ion channels and membrane potentials with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Additionally, the development of optoswitches and biosensors facilitates real-time monitoring and control of metabolic pathways, enhancing our understanding of plant growth and adaptation. This synthesis of optogenetic tools in plant systems not only advances fundamental research but also holds potential for agricultural innovations, such as improving crop resilience and productivity in response to climate change."}
