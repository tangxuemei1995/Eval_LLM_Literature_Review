{"Abstract": "Mycorrhizal symbiosis plays a pivotal role in plant growth and stress adaptation, influencing ecosystems from the genetic to the community level. This review explores the intricate interactions within common mycorrhizal networks, highlighting their capacity to enhance nutrient exchange and improve plant resilience to environmental stressors. The involvement of mycorrhizae helper bacteria is examined, emphasizing their role in facilitating symbiotic efficiency and promoting plant health. Recent advances in understanding the autoregulation of mycorrhizae reveal complex signaling pathways that optimize symbiotic associations, ensuring balanced resource allocation. By integrating insights from molecular biology, ecology, and environmental science, this study underscores the significance of mycorrhizal networks in sustaining plant communities and maintaining ecosystem stability. Future research directions are proposed to further elucidate the genetic and ecological mechanisms underpinning mycorrhizal symbiosis, with implications for enhancing agricultural productivity and ecosystem restoration efforts."}
