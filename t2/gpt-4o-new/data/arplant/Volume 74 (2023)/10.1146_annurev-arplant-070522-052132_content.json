{"Abstract": "Proximity labeling (PL) has emerged as a powerful technique for elucidating protein–protein and protein–nucleotide interactions within the complex cellular environments of plants. This method involves the use of engineered enzymes that catalyze the covalent attachment of biotin or other tags to nearby proteins or nucleotides, enabling the capture and identification of interaction partners in vivo. The application of PL in plant systems offers significant advantages for mapping subcellular and cell type–specific proteomes, which are crucial for understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of plant cellular processes. Recent advancements in PL technologies, such as TurboID and miniTurbo, have enhanced the speed and efficiency of labeling, allowing for more precise quantification of interactions under various physiological conditions. These improvements facilitate the study of transient and weak interactions that are often missed by traditional methods. Furthermore, PL can be integrated with mass spectrometry to provide a comprehensive view of the proteomic landscape, offering insights into the functional networks that underpin plant development and stress responses. This review highlights the current state of PL applications in plant research, discusses methodological considerations, and explores future directions for expanding the utility of PL in plant biology. By advancing our understanding of plant proteomes, PL holds the potential to drive innovations in agriculture and biotechnology, ultimately contributing to sustainable crop production and food security."}
