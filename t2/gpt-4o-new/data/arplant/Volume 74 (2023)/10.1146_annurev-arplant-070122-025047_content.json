{"Abstract": "Epigenetic regulation plays a crucial role in plant development, influencing gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. This regulation is mediated through mechanisms such as histone modifications and DNA methylation, which can modulate chromatin structure and accessibility. These epigenetic marks are dynamic, allowing plants to adapt to environmental changes, such as heat stress, by altering gene expression patterns. Furthermore, epigenetic memory enables plants to 'remember' past environmental conditions, potentially enhancing their resilience to future stresses. Transposable elements, often silenced by epigenetic mechanisms, can also contribute to genomic plasticity and adaptation. This review explores the intricate network of epigenetic regulation during plant development, emphasizing the capacity for epigenetic memory in response to environmental stimuli. Understanding these processes provides insights into plant adaptability and resilience, offering potential strategies for improving crop performance under changing climatic conditions."}
