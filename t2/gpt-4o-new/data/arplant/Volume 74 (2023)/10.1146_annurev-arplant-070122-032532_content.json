{"Abstract": "Chloroplasts, essential organelles for photosynthesis in plants, require a finely tuned proteostasis network to maintain their function and integrity. This review explores the intricate processes of protein import, sorting, ubiquitination, and proteolysis within chloroplasts. Protein translocation into chloroplasts is mediated by the TOC/TIC complexes, which ensure the precise import and sorting of nuclear-encoded proteins. Once inside, proteins are directed to their functional destinations, a process critical for chloroplast biogenesis and function. Ubiquitination, a post-translational modification, plays a pivotal role in marking misfolded or damaged proteins for degradation, thus maintaining protein quality control. The ubiquitin-proteasome system, although primarily cytosolic, has emerging roles in chloroplast proteostasis, highlighting the interplay between cytosolic and plastidial protein degradation pathways. Proteolysis within chloroplasts is facilitated by specific proteases, ensuring the removal of defective proteins and the regulation of protein turnover. Understanding these processes provides insights into the maintenance of chloroplast function and plant health."}
