{"Abstract": "Between-plant signaling is a complex and dynamic process facilitated by various biotic interactions, including those mediated by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and common mycelial networks (CMNs). These networks enable interplant signaling, allowing plants to communicate and share resources, enhancing their resilience to environmental stresses. AMF and CMNs play a crucial role in systemic signaling, where signals are transmitted across plant communities, influencing growth, defense mechanisms, and nutrient acquisition. Additionally, parasitic plants exploit these networks to siphon resources from host plants, demonstrating the dual nature of interplant signaling as both beneficial and detrimental. This review synthesizes current research on the mechanisms and ecological implications of between-plant signaling, highlighting the importance of these interactions in maintaining ecosystem stability and biodiversity. Understanding these processes offers insights into sustainable agricultural practices and the development of strategies to mitigate the impacts of parasitic plants on crop productivity."}
