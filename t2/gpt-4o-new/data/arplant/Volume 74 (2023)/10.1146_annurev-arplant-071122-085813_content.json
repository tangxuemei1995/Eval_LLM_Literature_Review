{"Abstract": "RNA modifications have emerged as pivotal regulators of gene expression, influencing various biological processes in plants. This review delves into the diversity and functional roles of RNA modifications, with a focus on mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA in plant systems. Among the myriad of modifications, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and 5-methylcytosine (m5C) are highlighted for their significant roles in modulating RNA stability, translation, and splicing. These modifications are not only crucial for normal plant development but also play a vital role in plant stress responses, enabling plants to adapt to environmental challenges. The review synthesizes current knowledge on the enzymatic machinery responsible for these modifications, including writers, erasers, and readers, and their dynamic regulation under stress conditions. Despite the advances in understanding RNA modifications, many questions remain regarding their precise molecular mechanisms and the full spectrum of their biological functions. The review calls for further research employing advanced technologies such as high-throughput sequencing and CRISPR-based tools to unravel the complexities of RNA modifications. By expanding our understanding of RNA modifications, we can potentially enhance crop resilience and productivity, addressing global food security challenges. This review serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers aiming to explore the functional diversity of RNA modifications in plants."}
