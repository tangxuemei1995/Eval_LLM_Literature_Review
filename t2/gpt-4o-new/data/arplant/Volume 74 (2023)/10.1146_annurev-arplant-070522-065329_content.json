{"Abstract": "Circadian rhythms, the intrinsic time-keeping mechanisms present in most living organisms, play a crucial role in synchronizing biological processes with environmental cycles. This study explores the intersection of circadian rhythms with rapidly changing environments due to climate change. By examining the signaling networks that govern these rhythms, we aim to understand how organisms adapt to new environmental conditions. Our research highlights the plasticity of circadian systems, which can adjust to shifts in temperature, light, and other environmental cues. We discuss the implications of these adaptations for survival and fitness, emphasizing the potential for circadian rhythms to serve as a buffer against environmental stressors. Furthermore, we investigate the molecular and genetic bases of these adaptations, providing insights into the evolutionary pressures exerted by climate change. This work underscores the importance of integrating circadian biology with ecological and environmental sciences to predict and mitigate the impacts of global climate shifts on biodiversity."}
