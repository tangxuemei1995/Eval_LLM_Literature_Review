{"Abstract": "The SWI/SNF chromatin remodelers are pivotal in modulating chromatin architecture, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular function. These ATP-dependent complexes facilitate the repositioning, ejection, or restructuring of nucleosomes, which are the fundamental units of chromatin. By altering nucleosome positioning, SWI/SNF complexes enable or restrict access to DNA for transcription factors and other regulatory proteins, thus playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. This review explores the mechanistic underpinnings of SWI/SNF activity, focusing on the ATPase subunits that drive chromatin remodeling. We discuss how these remodelers interact with nucleosomes and the subsequent impact on chromatin dynamics. Furthermore, the role of SWI/SNF complexes in development and cellular response to environmental stimuli is examined, highlighting their involvement in cell differentiation and adaptation processes. Recent studies have elucidated the diverse functions of SWI/SNF complexes in various biological contexts, including their contribution to the regulation of developmental pathways and response to external signals. The dysregulation of SWI/SNF activity is implicated in numerous diseases, underscoring the importance of these remodelers in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Understanding the intricate mechanisms of SWI/SNF function provides insights into their potential as therapeutic targets in disease contexts where chromatin remodeling is disrupted."}
