{"Abstract": "Lipid droplets (LDs) are dynamic organelles that play a crucial role in cellular lipid metabolism by storing neutral lipids, primarily triacylglycerols, within the aqueous environment of the cytoplasm. These organelles are essential for energy homeostasis, acting as reservoirs of metabolic energy that can be mobilized when needed. The biogenesis of lipid droplets involves the budding of a monolayer of phospholipids from the endoplasmic reticulum, encapsulating a core of hydrophobic molecules. This process is tightly regulated and involves a complex interplay of proteins and lipids that ensure the proper formation and function of LDs. Compartmentation within LDs allows for the segregation of hydrophobic molecules, preventing their interference with cellular processes in the aqueous cytoplasm. In addition to their role in energy storage, lipid droplets are involved in various cellular processes, including lipid signaling, protein sequestration, and the regulation of lipid metabolism. In seeds, lipid droplets, often referred to as oil bodies, are particularly important for storing energy-rich compounds that support seed germination and early seedling growth. Understanding the mechanisms governing lipid droplet formation, maintenance, and mobilization is critical for elucidating their role in cellular physiology and their potential implications in metabolic disorders. This review highlights recent advances in our understanding of lipid droplet biology, emphasizing their biogenesis, compartmentation, and metabolic functions."}
