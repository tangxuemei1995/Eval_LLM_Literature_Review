{"Abstract": "Plant hormones, or phytohormones, are crucial signaling molecules that regulate growth, development, and stress responses. This review explores the transport and localization mechanisms of key phytohormones, including auxin (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), cytokinin (CK), gibberellin (GA), ethylene, and jasmonic acid (JA). Understanding the transport mechanisms, such as specific transporters and cellular pathways, is essential for maintaining hormone homeostasis and ensuring precise spatial and temporal signaling. Recent advances highlight the role of transport proteins and vesicular trafficking in hormone distribution, influencing plant physiology and adaptation. The interplay between different hormones and their transport systems underscores the complexity of plant signaling networks. This synthesis of current knowledge provides insights into the dynamic movement of phytohormones, offering potential strategies for enhancing crop resilience and productivity through targeted manipulation of hormone transport pathways."}
