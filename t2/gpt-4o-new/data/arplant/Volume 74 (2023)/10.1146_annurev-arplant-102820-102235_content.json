{"Abstract": "Temperature sensing in plants is a critical adaptive mechanism that enables survival under varying thermal conditions. This study focuses on the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana to elucidate the molecular and physiological processes underlying plant thermosensation. We explore the role of thermosensors in detecting temperature fluctuations and initiating appropriate responses to heat and cold stress. Our findings highlight the significance of thermomorphogenesis, a process by which plants alter their growth and development in response to temperature changes. By examining gene expression patterns and phenotypic adaptations, we identify key regulatory pathways that facilitate thermal adaptation. This research advances our understanding of plant resilience to climate variability and provides insights into potential strategies for enhancing crop tolerance to extreme temperatures, thereby contributing to agricultural sustainability in the face of global climate change."}
