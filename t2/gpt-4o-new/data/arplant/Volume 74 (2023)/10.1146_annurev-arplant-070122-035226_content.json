{"Abstract": "Plant small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and phased secondary siRNAs (phasiRNAs), are pivotal regulators of gene expression, influencing plant development and stress responses. These small RNAs are generated through distinct biogenesis pathways, involving Dicer-like enzymes and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, which produce mature RNA molecules that guide the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to target mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression. miRNAs primarily regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally, while siRNAs, including mobile siRNAs, can move between cells to coordinate developmental processes and defense mechanisms. PhasiRNAs, derived from precursor transcripts, play crucial roles in reproductive development. The intricate network of small RNA-mediated regulation underscores their importance in plant growth, development, and adaptation to environmental challenges. Understanding the biogenesis and functional dynamics of these small RNAs offers insights into plant biology and potential applications in crop improvement and stress resilience."}
