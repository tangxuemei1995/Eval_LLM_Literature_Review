{"Abstract": "The intricate metabolic interplay between neurons and astrocytes is crucial for maintaining brain function, particularly under varying energetic demands. This study explores the recruitment of metabolic pathways in brain tissue, focusing on the roles of glucose, lactate, and oxygen in neuronal and astrocytic metabolism. Neurons primarily rely on oxidative phosphorylation within mitochondria, necessitating a continuous supply of oxygen and glucose. In contrast, astrocytes predominantly utilize glycolysis, producing lactate as a byproduct, which can be shuttled to neurons as an alternative energy substrate. This lactate shuttle hypothesis underscores the complementary metabolic roles of these cell types. Our findings highlight the dynamic regulation of glycolytic and oxidative pathways, emphasizing the adaptability of brain tissue to fluctuating energy requirements. Understanding these metabolic interactions provides insights into the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases and potential therapeutic targets for enhancing brain resilience under metabolic stress."}
