{"Abstract": "Protein trafficking and quality control are critical processes in maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly in the kidney, where precise protein sorting and degradation are essential for function. This review explores the intricate mechanisms governing protein trafficking, focusing on the roles of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, and vesicular transport systems. We highlight the significance of the transmembrane emp24 domain-containing (TMED) family in cargo selection and transport within the secretory pathway. The study further delves into the proteome dynamics involved in vesicle formation and fusion, emphasizing the importance of these processes in kidney physiology and pathology. Disruptions in these pathways can lead to kidney diseases, underscoring the need for a comprehensive understanding of protein trafficking and quality control. Additionally, we discuss the broader implications of these mechanisms beyond the kidney, including their roles in lysosomal function and systemic protein homeostasis, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets for related disorders."}
