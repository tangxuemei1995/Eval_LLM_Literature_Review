{"Abstract": "The perception of salt taste is a critical component of gustation, influencing dietary choices and maintaining electrolyte balance. This review explores the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying salt taste, focusing on the role of sodium ions and their interaction with taste receptors. The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is identified as a primary mediator of salt taste, particularly for low-sodium concentrations, where it contributes to the detection and transduction of salty stimuli. Recent studies have elucidated the valence of salt taste, highlighting the dual nature of sodium as both an essential nutrient and a potential health risk at high concentrations. The review also examines the integration of salt taste signals within the gustatory system and their modulation by other taste modalities. Understanding these mechanisms provides insights into the complex interplay between taste perception and dietary behavior, with implications for addressing health issues related to sodium consumption."}
