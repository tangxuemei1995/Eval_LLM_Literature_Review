{"Abstract": "The mammalian liver is a complex organ characterized by its remarkable capacity for regeneration and maintenance of homeostasis. This review explores the multifaceted nature of liver zonation and cellular heterogeneity, which are crucial for its diverse metabolic functions. We examine the mechanisms underlying liver homeostasis, focusing on the dynamic balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis. The liver's response to acute and chronic injury is discussed, highlighting the role of cellular plasticity in regeneration. Hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells exhibit distinct regenerative capabilities, influenced by their microenvironment and zonal location. Understanding these processes is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to enhance liver regeneration and repair. This synthesis of current research underscores the liver's adaptability and resilience, providing insights into its regenerative biology and potential interventions for liver diseases."}
