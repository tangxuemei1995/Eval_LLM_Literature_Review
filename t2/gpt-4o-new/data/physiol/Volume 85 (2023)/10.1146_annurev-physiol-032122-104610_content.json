{"Abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulumâ€“plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions are increasingly recognized as critical sites for Ca2+ signaling, particularly in excitable cells such as neurons and muscle tissues. These specialized membrane contact sites facilitate the rapid and localized exchange of ions and second messengers, crucial for cellular responses to depolarization. This study explores the role of ER-PM junctions in modulating Ca2+ dynamics across skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle cells, as well as neurons. We highlight the involvement of specific ion channels and transporters that are strategically positioned at these junctions, enabling efficient Ca2+ influx and release. Our findings suggest that the spatial organization of these junctions is essential for the precise regulation of Ca2+ signaling, which is vital for muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and other cellular functions. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing these interactions provides insights into the pathophysiology of diseases associated with dysregulated Ca2+ signaling and offers potential therapeutic targets for intervention."}
