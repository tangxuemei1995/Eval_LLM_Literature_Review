{"Abstract": "Myostatin, also known as growth differentiation factor-8 (GDF-8), is a member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily and functions as a critical chalone in skeletal muscle regulation. It plays a pivotal role in controlling muscle growth and tissue size by inhibiting myogenesis. Myostatin is synthesized as a latent precursor that requires activation to exert its biological effects, often through proteolytic cleavage. This regulatory mechanism ensures precise modulation of muscle mass, preventing excessive growth. Myostatin's interaction with activin receptors further underscores its importance in muscle homeostasis. Understanding the molecular pathways and regulatory networks involving myostatin could provide insights into therapeutic strategies for muscle-wasting diseases and conditions characterized by abnormal muscle growth. This review explores the biochemical properties, activation processes, and physiological implications of myostatin in skeletal muscle biology."}
