{"Abstract": "Fatty acids play a crucial role in cellular metabolism and signaling, influencing various physiological processes. This review explores the mechanisms of fatty acid transport and signaling, focusing on key proteins such as CD36, FFAR1, and FFAR4. CD36 facilitates the uptake of long-chain fatty acids, while FFAR1 and FFAR4 are G-protein-coupled receptors that mediate fatty acid signaling, impacting insulin secretion and anti-inflammatory responses. The role of caveolin in organizing lipid rafts and modulating receptor activity is also examined. Furthermore, the review discusses the implications of fatty acid signaling in Î²-oxidation and tissue repair, highlighting its potential in therapeutic strategies for metabolic disorders and injury recovery. Understanding these mechanisms provides insights into the complex interplay between fatty acid metabolism and cellular function, offering avenues for novel interventions in metabolic and inflammatory diseases."}
