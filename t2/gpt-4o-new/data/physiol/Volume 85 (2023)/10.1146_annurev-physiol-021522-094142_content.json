{"Abstract": "Recent advancements in molecular tools have significantly transformed our understanding of breathing control mechanisms. Central to this transformation is the preBötzinger complex (preBötC), a critical neural network in the brainstem responsible for generating respiratory rhythm. Molecular techniques have elucidated the role of lung sensory inputs and their integration within the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), enhancing our comprehension of the Hering-Breuer reflex, which modulates breathing patterns. Furthermore, the involvement of neurotransmitters, particularly serotonin, has been highlighted in modulating respiratory circuits, offering insights into the neuromodulatory processes that influence breathing. These molecular insights have not only deepened our understanding of the fundamental physiology of respiration but also opened new avenues for addressing respiratory disorders. By leveraging these tools, researchers are now better equipped to dissect the complex interplay between neural circuits and molecular signals, paving the way for innovative therapeutic strategies to manage conditions such as sleep apnea and congenital central hypoventilation syndrome."}
