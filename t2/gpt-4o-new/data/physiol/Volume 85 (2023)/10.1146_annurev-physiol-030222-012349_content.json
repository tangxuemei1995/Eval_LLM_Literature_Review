{"Abstract": "Transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) channels are integral to various physiological processes, including thermosensation, osmoregulation, and nociception. Despite significant advances in understanding their molecular structure and function, controversies persist regarding their precise roles in pain perception and ion selectivity. Recent structural studies have provided insights into the conformational dynamics of TRPV channels, yet the translation of these findings into therapeutic applications remains challenging. This review synthesizes current knowledge on TRPV channel physiology, highlighting unresolved questions and emerging research directions. Future challenges include elucidating the complex regulatory mechanisms governing TRPV channel activity and developing selective modulators for clinical use. Addressing these challenges will enhance our understanding of TRPV channels' physiological roles and their potential as targets for pain management and other therapeutic interventions."}
