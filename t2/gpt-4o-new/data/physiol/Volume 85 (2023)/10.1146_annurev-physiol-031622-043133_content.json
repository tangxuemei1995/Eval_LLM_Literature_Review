{"Abstract": "Insulin clearance is a critical determinant of insulin action and plays a pivotal role in maintaining glucose homeostasis. This review explores the mechanisms of insulin clearance in both health and disease, emphasizing its impact on insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. We examine how factors such as age, ethnicity, and the presence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) influence insulin clearance rates. The interplay between hyperglycemia and insulin clearance is also discussed, highlighting the potential for altered clearance to exacerbate metabolic dysfunction. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing targeted interventions to improve insulin sensitivity and manage conditions like NAFLD. This synthesis of current research underscores the need for further studies to elucidate the complex relationships between insulin clearance and metabolic health across diverse populations."}
