{"Abstract": "Proprioception, the body's intrinsic ability to sense movement and position, is undergoing a transformative era driven by genetic and bionic innovations. Recent advances in understanding proprioceptive sensory neurons, muscle spindles, and Golgi tendon organs have elucidated their roles in kinesthetic illusions and neural processing within the dorsal column nuclei and somatosensory cortex. Concurrently, the development of neural machine interfaces and advanced prosthetic limbs is enhancing proprioceptive feedback in amputees, offering unprecedented integration with the nervous system. This review explores the intersection of genetic insights and bionic technologies, highlighting their potential to revolutionize therapeutic strategies and improve quality of life for individuals with proprioceptive deficits."}
