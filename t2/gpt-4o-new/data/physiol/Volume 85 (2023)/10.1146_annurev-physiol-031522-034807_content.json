{"Abstract": "Pericytes, integral components of the microvascular system, play a crucial role in regulating blood flow in both the brain and heart. This study explores the mechanisms by which pericytes influence neurovascular coupling and cardiac function, focusing on their electro-metabolic signaling capabilities. Pericytes modulate blood flow through ion channels, particularly those involving calcium and potassium, which are essential for maintaining metabolic homeostasis. In the brain, pericytes contribute to neurovascular coupling by responding to neuronal activity and adjusting capillary diameter, thereby optimizing oxygen and nutrient delivery. Similarly, in the heart, pericytes are involved in the regulation of coronary blood flow, ensuring efficient cardiac metabolism. This research highlights the importance of pericytes in maintaining the delicate balance of blood supply and metabolic demand in these vital organs. Understanding the signaling pathways and ion channel dynamics in pericytes could lead to novel therapeutic strategies for conditions such as stroke and heart disease, where blood flow regulation is compromised."}
