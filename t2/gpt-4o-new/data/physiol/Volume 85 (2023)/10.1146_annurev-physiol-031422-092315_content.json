{"Abstract": "Cough is a prevalent symptom of respiratory tract infections, serving as a mechanism for disease transmission. This study explores the infectious and inflammatory pathways that contribute to cough, focusing on the role of sensory neurons in the respiratory system. We examine how pathogens trigger inflammatory responses, leading to the activation of sensory neurons and subsequent cough reflex. Understanding these pathways is crucial for developing targeted therapies to mitigate cough and reduce transmission of infectious diseases. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between infection, inflammation, and neural pathways in the pathophysiology of cough."}
