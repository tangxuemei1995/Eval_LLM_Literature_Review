{"Abstract": "The intricate relationship between iron metabolism and diabetes pathophysiology has garnered significant attention in recent years. This review explores the role of iron in the development and progression of diabetes, focusing on the regulatory hormone hepcidin and its impact on iron homeostasis. Excessive iron accumulation, as observed in conditions like hemochromatosis, is linked to insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction, contributing to the onset of diabetes. Adipocytes, or fat cells, also play a crucial role in this interplay, as they can influence systemic iron levels and insulin sensitivity. The dysregulation of iron metabolism may exacerbate oxidative stress and inflammation, further impairing insulin action. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions could pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting iron metabolism to mitigate diabetes risk and progression. This review underscores the need for further research to elucidate the precise pathways through which iron influences diabetes pathophysiology."}
