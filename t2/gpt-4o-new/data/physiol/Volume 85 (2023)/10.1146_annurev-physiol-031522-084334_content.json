{"Abstract": "Polycystin channel complexes, primarily composed of polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a prevalent genetic disorder characterized by the formation of renal cysts. These complexes are integral to the function of primary cilia, acting as mechanosensors and regulators of calcium signaling. Recent studies have elucidated the gating mechanisms of polycystin channels, revealing their structural and functional similarities to transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing targeted therapies for ADPKD and related ciliopathies. This review synthesizes current insights into the molecular architecture and biophysical properties of polycystin channel complexes, highlighting their significance in cellular signaling and potential as therapeutic targets in ciliopathies."}
