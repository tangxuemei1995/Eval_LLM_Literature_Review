{"Abstract": "Endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is a complex biological process where endothelial cells lose their specific markers and acquire mesenchymal characteristics. This transition plays a crucial role in embryonic development, tissue repair, and fibrosis. In the context of cardiovascular health, EndMT is implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including atherosclerosis, cardiac fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying EndMT is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to mitigate its detrimental effects in disease states. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of signaling pathways such as TGF-Î², Wnt, and Notch in regulating EndMT. Moreover, the identification of key transcription factors and epigenetic modifications offers new insights into the modulation of this process. This review aims to synthesize current knowledge on EndMT, emphasizing its dual role in health and disease, and to explore potential therapeutic interventions."}
