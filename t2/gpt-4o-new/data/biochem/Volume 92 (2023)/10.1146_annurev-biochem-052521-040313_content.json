{"Abstract": "The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is a critical regulator of embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis, with its activity intricately linked to cholesterol. This review explores the multifaceted relationship between cholesterol and Hh signaling, emphasizing the role of cholesterol in modulating the function of primary cilia and biological membranes, which are essential for Hh pathway activation. Cholesterol's influence extends to the regulation of G proteinâ€“coupled receptors and cell surface receptors, which are pivotal in transducing Hh signals. Recent studies highlight cholesterol's dual role as a structural component and a signaling molecule, underscoring its importance in the spatial and temporal control of Hh signaling. Understanding this relationship offers insights into developmental biology and potential therapeutic targets for Hh-related pathologies."}
