{"Abstract": "Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a specialized sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER) that specifically targets and rectifies DNA lesions on the transcribed strand of active genes. This process is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing mutagenesis. Key players in TCR include the transcription-repair coupling factors Mfd in prokaryotes and CSB in eukaryotes, which facilitate the recognition and removal of transcription-blocking lesions. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms by which these factors interact with the transcription machinery and recruit repair proteins to the site of damage. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests a link between TCR and the circadian clock, indicating that DNA repair efficiency may be modulated by circadian rhythms. Understanding these intricate molecular interactions provides insights into the prevention of mutagenesis and the potential development of therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with defective DNA repair mechanisms."}
