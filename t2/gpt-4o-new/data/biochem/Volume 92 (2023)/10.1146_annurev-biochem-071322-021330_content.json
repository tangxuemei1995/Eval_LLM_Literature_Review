{"Abstract": "Polyamines, small organic cations, play a dual role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD), oscillating between neurotoxicity and neuroprotection. This study explores the intricate balance of polyamines within the cellular environment, particularly focusing on their interactions with endo/lysosomal and mitochondrial pathways. The accumulation of Î±-synuclein, a hallmark of PD, is influenced by polyamine levels, which can modulate its aggregation and clearance. Astrocytes, crucial for maintaining neuronal health, are also affected by polyamine dynamics, impacting their ability to support neurons and manage oxidative stress. Understanding the precise mechanisms by which polyamines contribute to both the progression and potential mitigation of PD symptoms could unveil novel therapeutic targets. This research underscores the importance of a nuanced approach to polyamine regulation, aiming to harness their protective properties while minimizing their detrimental effects."}
