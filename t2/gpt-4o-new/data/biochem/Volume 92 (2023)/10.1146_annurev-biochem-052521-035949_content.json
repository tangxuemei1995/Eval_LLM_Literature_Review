{"Abstract": "RNA modifications have emerged as pivotal regulators of mRNA metabolism, influencing various posttranscriptional processes. This study delves into the epitranscriptome, highlighting the dynamic nature of RNA modifications such as N6-methyladenosine (m6A), pseudouridine, and 5-methylcytosine. These modifications modulate mRNA stability, splicing, translation, and localization, thereby orchestrating gene expression in response to cellular signals. By integrating high-throughput sequencing technologies and biochemical assays, we elucidate the mechanisms by which these modifications impact mRNA function. Our findings underscore the complexity of posttranscriptional regulation and suggest potential therapeutic targets for diseases linked to dysregulated RNA modification patterns. This research advances our understanding of the intricate layers of gene expression control mediated by the epitranscriptome."}
