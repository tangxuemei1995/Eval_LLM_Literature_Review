{"Abstract": "The 3′-end processing of eukaryotic mRNA is a critical step in gene expression, involving the precise cleavage and polyadenylation of pre-mRNA. This process is orchestrated by a complex machinery comprising endonucleases, poly(A) polymerases, and a host of regulatory proteins. The addition of a poly(A) tail is essential for mRNA stability, nuclear export, and translation efficiency. Regulation of 3′-end processing is tightly linked to transcription, with factors such as the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II playing a pivotal role. Recent advances have elucidated the dynamic interactions between processing components and their impact on alternative polyadenylation, which can generate mRNA isoforms with distinct regulatory and functional properties. Understanding the nuances of 3′-end processing not only provides insights into fundamental cellular processes but also highlights its implications in diseases where these mechanisms are disrupted. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the machinery, regulation, and biological significance of mRNA 3′-end processing."}
