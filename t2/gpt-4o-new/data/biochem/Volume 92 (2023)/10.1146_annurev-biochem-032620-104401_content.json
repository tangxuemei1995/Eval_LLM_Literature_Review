{"Abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release into the cytosol is increasingly recognized as a pivotal event in the activation of innate immune signaling pathways. This process is implicated in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases, where mtDNA acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) that is sensed by cytosolic DNA sensors. The release of mtDNA is often facilitated by the formation of mitochondrial pores, which can be induced by cellular stress or damage. Once in the cytosol, mtDNA can engage with pattern recognition receptors such as cGAS-STING, leading to the production of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines. This review explores the mechanisms underlying mtDNA release, the role of mitochondrial pores in this process, and the subsequent activation of DNA sensing pathways. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of mtDNA-mediated inflammation in disease contexts, highlighting potential therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating mtDNA release and its downstream signaling. Understanding these processes is crucial for developing interventions to mitigate inflammation-driven pathologies."}
