{"Abstract": "SMC (Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes) complexes play a pivotal role in genome organization through the process of DNA loop extrusion. This dynamic mechanism is essential for various cellular processes, including chromosome segregation, DNA repair, and transcription regulation. Recent advancements in single-molecule studies have provided unprecedented insights into the molecular dynamics and mechanistic underpinnings of SMC complexes. These studies reveal how SMC complexes facilitate the formation and stabilization of DNA loops, thereby influencing chromatin architecture and gene expression. Understanding the intricacies of SMC-mediated loop extrusion not only enhances our comprehension of genome organization but also opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting chromosomal abnormalities. This review synthesizes current findings and highlights future directions in the study of SMC complexes."}
