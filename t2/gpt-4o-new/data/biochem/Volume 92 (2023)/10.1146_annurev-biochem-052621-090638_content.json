{"Abstract": "The radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme superfamily is pivotal in catalyzing a diverse array of radical-mediated transformations, crucial for various biological processes. Central to their function is the generation of a 5â€²-deoxyadenosyl radical, initiated by the reductive cleavage of SAM. This study delves into the mechanistic intricacies of radical initiation within this enzyme superfamily, emphasizing the role of organometallic intermediates. Utilizing advanced spectroscopic techniques and computational modeling, we elucidate the electron transfer pathways and the structural dynamics that facilitate the homolytic cleavage of the S-C bond in SAM. Our findings highlight the critical involvement of iron-sulfur clusters in stabilizing radical intermediates and orchestrating the precise control of radical generation. This research not only enhances our understanding of the fundamental biochemical principles governing radical SAM enzymes but also opens avenues for engineering these enzymes for biotechnological applications, including natural product biosynthesis and novel therapeutic development."}
