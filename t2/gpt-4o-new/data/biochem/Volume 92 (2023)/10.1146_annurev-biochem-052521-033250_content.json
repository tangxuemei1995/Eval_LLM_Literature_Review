{"Abstract": "The insulin receptor (IR) plays a pivotal role in glucose homeostasis, and its activation mechanism is crucial for understanding insulin signaling pathways. This study employs cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to elucidate the structural dynamics of IR upon insulin binding. We focus on the conformational changes at insulin-binding sites 1 and 2, which are essential for receptor activation. Our findings reveal that insulin binding induces a significant rearrangement in the extracellular domain, facilitating the transmembrane signaling cascade. The structural insights highlight the allosteric modulation between the two binding sites, providing a detailed map of the activation process. These results enhance our understanding of the molecular basis of insulin action and offer potential targets for therapeutic intervention in insulin resistance and diabetes. This study underscores the importance of structural biology in unraveling complex biochemical processes and paves the way for future research into receptor-ligand interactions."}
