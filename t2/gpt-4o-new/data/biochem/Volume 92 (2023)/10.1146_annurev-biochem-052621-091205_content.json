{"Abstract": "Transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) is a critical cellular mechanism that rectifies DNA lesions, particularly those induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which can impede transcription by RNA polymerase II. This study explores the interplay between TC-NER and the transcriptional response to UV-induced DNA damage, highlighting the distinct roles of TC-NER and global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER). While GG-NER operates throughout the genome, TC-NER specifically targets lesions on the transcribed strand of active genes, ensuring rapid resumption of transcription. The research delves into the molecular dynamics of TC-NER, examining its impact on transcriptional fidelity and cellular recovery post-UV exposure. Furthermore, the study investigates the implications of TC-NER deficiencies, as observed in disorders like Cockayne syndrome, which manifest heightened sensitivity to UV and impaired transcriptional recovery. These findings underscore the importance of TC-NER in maintaining genomic integrity and cellular homeostasis, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets for related genetic disorders."}
