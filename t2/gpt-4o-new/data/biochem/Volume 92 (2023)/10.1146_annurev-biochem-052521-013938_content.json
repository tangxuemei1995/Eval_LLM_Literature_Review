{"Abstract": "The advent of DNA-editing enzymes, particularly base editors, has revolutionized genetic engineering by enabling precise nucleotide modifications without inducing double-strand breaks. This study explores the design and application of base editors, focusing on the integration of deaminases, methyltransferases, demethylases, and glycosylases. Through protein engineering, these enzymes are tailored to achieve targeted base conversions, offering a versatile toolkit for genomic modifications. Deaminases facilitate C-to-T and A-to-G transitions, while methyltransferases and demethylases modulate epigenetic marks, expanding the scope of base editing beyond simple nucleotide changes. Glycosylases further enhance specificity by excising mismatched bases, reducing off-target effects. The application of these engineered enzymes in therapeutic contexts, such as correcting pathogenic mutations and modulating gene expression, underscores their potential in precision medicine. This research highlights the ongoing advancements in base editor technology, emphasizing the importance of enzyme design in achieving efficient and accurate genome editing."}
