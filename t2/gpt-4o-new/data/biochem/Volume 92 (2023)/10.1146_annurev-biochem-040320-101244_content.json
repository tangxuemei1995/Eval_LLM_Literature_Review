{"Abstract": "Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) is a pivotal enzyme in the Calvin cycle, facilitating the conversion of atmospheric carbon dioxide into organic compounds through carbon fixation. Despite its essential role in photosynthesis, Rubisco is characterized by a relatively slow catalytic rate and a propensity for oxygenation, which leads to photorespiration and reduced photosynthetic efficiency. This has spurred extensive research into the enzyme's function, evolutionary history, and potential for engineering to enhance its performance. Evolutionary studies reveal that Rubisco has undergone significant diversification across different photosynthetic organisms, adapting to varying environmental CO2 and O2 concentrations. Recent advances in enzyme engineering have focused on improving Rubisco's catalytic efficiency and specificity for CO2 over O2, employing techniques such as directed evolution, rational design, and synthetic biology. These efforts aim to optimize photosynthetic efficiency and increase crop yields, addressing global food security and climate change challenges. This review synthesizes current understanding of Rubisco's biochemical properties, evolutionary adaptations, and the latest strategies in enzyme engineering to enhance its function."}
