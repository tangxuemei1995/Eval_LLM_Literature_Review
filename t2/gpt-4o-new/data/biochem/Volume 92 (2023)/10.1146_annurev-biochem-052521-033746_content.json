{"Abstract": "Thiolase enzymes are pivotal biocatalysts that facilitate the formation and cleavage of carbon-carbon (C–C) bonds through coenzyme A (CoA)–thioester chemistry. This study explores the intricate mechanisms by which thiolases employ a sophisticated hydrogen-bond network and proton wire to stabilize reaction intermediates, particularly focusing on the oxyanion hole's role in Claisen condensation reactions. The enzyme's active site architecture, characterized by its ability to accommodate CoA-thioesters, is crucial for catalyzing reversible reactions that are essential in metabolic pathways such as fatty acid synthesis and degradation. By elucidating the structural and functional dynamics of thiolases, this research highlights their versatility and potential applications in synthetic biology and industrial biocatalysis. The findings underscore the importance of the enzyme's conformational flexibility and the strategic positioning of catalytic residues, which collectively enhance the efficiency and specificity of C–C bond transformations, offering insights into the design of novel biocatalysts."}
