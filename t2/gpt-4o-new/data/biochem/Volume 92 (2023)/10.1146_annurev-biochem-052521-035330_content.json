{"Abstract": "The dynamic landscape of RNA modifications, collectively known as the epitranscriptome, plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and cellular function. Among these modifications, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent and has been extensively studied. This review focuses on the proteins involved in the m6A modification process, categorized as writers, readers, and erasers. Writers, primarily methyltransferases, catalyze the addition of m6A marks, while reader proteins recognize and bind to these modifications, influencing RNA stability, translation, and splicing. Erasers, or demethylases, remove m6A marks, allowing for dynamic regulation of RNA function. Understanding the interplay between these proteins provides insights into the complex regulation of gene expression and highlights potential therapeutic targets for diseases linked to aberrant RNA modifications. This review synthesizes recent advances in the field, emphasizing the molecular mechanisms and biological implications of m6A and its associated proteins."}
