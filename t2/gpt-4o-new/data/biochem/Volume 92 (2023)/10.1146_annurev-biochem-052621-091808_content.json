{"Abstract": "The interplay between translation and mRNA stability is a critical aspect of gene expression regulation, influenced significantly by codon optimality. Codon usage, determined by the frequency of synonymous codons, affects translation elongation rates and mRNA decay. Optimal codons, which are efficiently recognized by abundant tRNAs, enhance translation elongation and stabilize mRNA, whereas non-optimal codons can lead to slower translation and increased mRNA degradation. This study explores the mechanisms by which codon optimality influences mRNA stability, focusing on the role of tRNA availability and its impact on translation elongation. We examine how variations in codon usage can modulate mRNA half-life and the implications for cellular protein synthesis. Additionally, we discuss the potential for codon usage to serve as a regulatory mechanism in response to cellular conditions, thereby affecting gene expression profiles. Understanding these dynamics provides insights into the fundamental processes of mRNA turnover and the broader implications for cellular homeostasis and adaptation."}
