{"Abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical and methodological framework for addressing health equity in the context of urban gentrification. Gentrification, often characterized by urban regeneration and displacement, poses significant challenges to health equity, disproportionately affecting marginalized communities. By synthesizing existing literature and empirical studies, this guide explores the multifaceted impacts of gentrification on urban health, emphasizing the need for equitable urban planning and policy interventions. It proposes innovative strategies to prevent or mitigate adverse health outcomes associated with displacement, including community engagement, policy advocacy, and cross-sector collaboration. The guide also outlines methodological approaches for assessing health impacts and evaluating interventions, providing a roadmap for researchers and policymakers to foster inclusive urban environments. Ultimately, this work aims to bridge the gap between urban development and public health, promoting sustainable and equitable cities for all residents."}
