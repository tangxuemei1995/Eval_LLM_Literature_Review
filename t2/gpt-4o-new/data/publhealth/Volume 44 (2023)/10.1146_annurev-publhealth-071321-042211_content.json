{"Abstract": "In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), physical activity often arises from necessity rather than choice, with active transport being a primary mode of movement. This study explores the implications of necessity-driven physical activity on global health, health equity, and social justice. By examining the socio-economic and infrastructural factors that compel individuals to engage in active transport, we aim to understand the barriers and facilitators of physical activity in these regions. The research highlights the disparity in physical activity opportunities between high-income and LMICs, emphasizing the need for policies that promote equitable access to safe and sustainable active transport options. Addressing these disparities is crucial for enhancing public health outcomes and achieving social justice. The findings suggest that interventions should focus on improving infrastructure, increasing awareness, and fostering environments that support voluntary physical activity, thereby transforming necessity into choice and promoting overall well-being in LMICs."}
