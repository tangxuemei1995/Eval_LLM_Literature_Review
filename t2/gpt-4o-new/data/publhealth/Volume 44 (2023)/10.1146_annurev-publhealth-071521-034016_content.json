{"Abstract": "The intersection of public health and the prison system has become increasingly critical in the era of mass incarceration. This study examines the health priorities within correctional facilities, highlighting the unique challenges faced by incarcerated populations. With over two million individuals currently imprisoned in the United States, the correctional health system is tasked with addressing a wide range of health issues, including infectious diseases, mental health disorders, and chronic conditions. The research underscores the importance of integrating comprehensive health services within prisons to improve health outcomes and reduce recidivism. Furthermore, the study explores the potential benefits of decarceration strategies, which aim to decrease the prison population and redirect resources towards community-based health interventions. By prioritizing public health within the context of mass incarceration, policymakers can address systemic health disparities and promote a more equitable healthcare system. The findings suggest that a shift towards decarceration and enhanced correctional health services could lead to significant improvements in public health, both within prisons and in the broader community."}
