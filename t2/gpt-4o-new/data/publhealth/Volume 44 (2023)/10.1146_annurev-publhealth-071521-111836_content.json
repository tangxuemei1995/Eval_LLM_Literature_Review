{"Abstract": "This review examines the intricate relationship between housing quality and disparities in health and well-being, emphasizing the critical role of indoor environments. Housing quality, encompassing structural integrity, ventilation, thermal comfort, and exposure to pollutants, significantly influences physical and mental health outcomes. Poor housing conditions are disproportionately experienced by marginalized populations, exacerbating health inequalities. The review synthesizes current guidelines and standards for healthy housing, highlighting their potential to mitigate adverse health effects and promote well-being. It also explores the cobenefits of improved housing quality, such as enhanced social cohesion and economic productivity. By integrating findings from recent studies, the review underscores the necessity for comprehensive policies that address housing quality as a determinant of health. It advocates for interdisciplinary approaches that involve stakeholders from public health, urban planning, and social services to develop and implement effective interventions. Ultimately, the review calls for a paradigm shift towards recognizing housing as a fundamental component of public health strategy, essential for reducing health disparities and enhancing overall well-being."}
