{"Abstract": "The rapid emergence and global spread of infectious diseases, exemplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, underscore the critical need for innovative public health surveillance systems. This study explores advancements in public health surveillance, focusing on the integration of spatial modeling and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the national notifiable disease reporting system. Traditional surveillance methods often struggle with timeliness and accuracy, limiting their effectiveness in early detection and response. By leveraging AI, particularly machine learning algorithms, public health systems can process vast amounts of data from diverse sources, including social media, electronic health records, and environmental sensors, to identify patterns indicative of emerging infections. Spatial modeling further augments these capabilities by providing geospatial analysis that can predict disease spread and identify hotspots, enabling targeted interventions. The integration of these technologies into existing frameworks promises to transform public health surveillance, offering real-time insights and predictive analytics that can inform policy decisions and resource allocation. This paper reviews current innovations, evaluates their effectiveness in recent outbreaks, and discusses challenges such as data privacy, interoperability, and the need for robust validation frameworks. Ultimately, these advancements hold the potential to significantly improve the agility and responsiveness of public health systems in managing infectious disease threats."}
