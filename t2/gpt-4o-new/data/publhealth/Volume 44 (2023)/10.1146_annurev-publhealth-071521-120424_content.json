{"Abstract": "This literature review examines the relationship between air pollution and COVID-19 health outcomes globally, highlighting statistical challenges and the role of data visualization in evidence synthesis. The review synthesizes findings from diverse studies, revealing that exposure to pollutants such as PM2.5 and NO2 may exacerbate COVID-19 severity and mortality. However, the complexity of isolating air pollution effects from confounding variables presents significant statistical challenges. The review discusses methodologies employed to address these challenges, including advanced statistical models and machine learning techniques. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of data visualization in enhancing the interpretability of complex datasets, facilitating clearer communication of findings to policymakers and the public. This synthesis underscores the need for robust, interdisciplinary approaches to better understand and mitigate the compounded health impacts of air pollution and COVID-19."}
