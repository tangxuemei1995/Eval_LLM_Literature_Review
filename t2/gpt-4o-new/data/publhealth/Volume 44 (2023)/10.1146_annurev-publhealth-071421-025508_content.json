{"Abstract": "As climate change intensifies, extreme heat events are becoming more frequent and severe, posing significant public health challenges. This study examines the effectiveness of heat action plans as a critical component of disaster risk reduction strategies. By analyzing case studies from various regions, we identify best practices and common pitfalls in public health preparedness for extreme heat. Our findings highlight the importance of early warning systems, community engagement, and inter-agency collaboration in mitigating the adverse health impacts of heatwaves. We also explore the role of urban planning and infrastructure improvements in enhancing resilience to extreme temperatures. The research underscores the need for adaptive strategies that incorporate climate projections and socio-economic factors to protect vulnerable populations. Ultimately, this study provides actionable insights for policymakers and public health officials to develop comprehensive and sustainable heat action plans in the face of escalating climate risks."}
