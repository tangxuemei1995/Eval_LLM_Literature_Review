{"Abstract": "The integration of rapid randomized controlled trials (RCTs) into health care systems presents a promising approach to enhancing quality improvement and safety. This study explores the application of rapid RCTs as a methodological innovation to address the dynamic challenges faced by health care systems. By leveraging the agility of rapid RCTs, health care providers can swiftly evaluate interventions, leading to timely and evidence-based decision-making. The research highlights the potential of these trials to generate robust data that inform policy and practice, ultimately improving patient outcomes and system efficiency. Key considerations include the design and implementation of trials that are both scientifically rigorous and adaptable to the fast-paced health care environment. The findings suggest that rapid RCTs can serve as a catalyst for continuous improvement, fostering a culture of safety and quality within health care systems. This approach underscores the importance of collaboration among stakeholders to ensure the successful integration of rapid RCTs into routine practice."}
