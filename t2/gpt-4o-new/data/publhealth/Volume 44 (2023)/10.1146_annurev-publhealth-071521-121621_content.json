{"Abstract": "Accurate assessment of food and nutrient intake is crucial in nutritional epidemiology to understand the relationship between diet and health outcomes. This study explores advanced methodologies to enhance capacity for dietary assessment in population sciences research. We focus on integrating nutritional biomarkers and regression calibration techniques to address measurement error, a common challenge in dietary data collection. By employing a combination of self-reported dietary assessments and objective biomarker data, we aim to improve the precision and validity of intake estimates. The study also evaluates the effectiveness of these methods in large-scale epidemiological studies, highlighting their potential to refine dietary exposure assessments. Our findings suggest that incorporating biomarkers and advanced statistical techniques can significantly mitigate biases associated with self-reported data, thereby enhancing the reliability of dietary intake assessments. This research underscores the importance of methodological advancements in nutritional epidemiology to better inform public health policies and dietary guidelines."}
