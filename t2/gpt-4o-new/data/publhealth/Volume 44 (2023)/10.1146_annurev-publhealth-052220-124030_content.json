{"Abstract": "This study examines the proportion of cancer cases attributable to modifiable risk factors, providing a comprehensive analysis of the potential for cancer prevention through lifestyle and environmental changes. By calculating the population attributable fraction (PAF) for various cancers, the research identifies key modifiable risk factors, including tobacco use, alcohol consumption, dietary habits, physical inactivity, and exposure to environmental carcinogens. The findings underscore the significant impact of these factors on cancer incidence, highlighting the potential for substantial reductions in cancer burden through targeted prevention strategies. The study advocates for integrated cancer control policies that prioritize risk factor modification, emphasizing the role of public health initiatives and individual behavioral changes. By mapping out a strategic approach to cancer prevention, this research offers a valuable framework for policymakers, healthcare providers, and researchers aiming to reduce the global cancer burden through effective risk factor management."}
