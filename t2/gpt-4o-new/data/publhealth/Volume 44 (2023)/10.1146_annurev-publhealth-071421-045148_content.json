{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationships between climatic and environmental changes, human migration, and health outcomes. As climate change intensifies, it exacerbates environmental stressors, leading to increased displacement and migration. This research examines how these forced movements impact health, considering both physical and mental health dimensions. By analyzing case studies and empirical data, the study identifies patterns of mobility triggered by climate-induced events such as floods, droughts, and rising sea levels. It further investigates the health challenges faced by displaced populations, including access to healthcare, nutrition, and mental health services. The findings underscore the need for integrated policies that address the root causes of climate-induced migration and prioritize health interventions. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between environmental change, migration, and health, offering insights for policymakers and stakeholders."}
