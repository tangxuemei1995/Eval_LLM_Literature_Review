{"Abstract": "The proliferation of health misinformation poses significant challenges to public health, exacerbating existing health disparities. This study examines the intersection of misinformation exposure and health disparities, with a focus on how structural racism contributes to these dynamics. By analyzing patterns of health misperception and behavior across diverse populations, we identify key factors that influence susceptibility to misinformation. Our findings suggest that marginalized communities, already burdened by systemic inequities, are disproportionately affected by health misinformation, which can lead to adverse health outcomes. We explore the role of digital platforms in disseminating misinformation and propose strategies to mitigate its impact, emphasizing the need for culturally sensitive interventions. This research highlights the urgent need for public health initiatives that address both misinformation and the underlying social determinants of health, offering opportunities to reduce health disparities and improve health equity through targeted education and policy reform."}
