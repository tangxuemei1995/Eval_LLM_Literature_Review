{"Abstract": "Environmental justice has emerged as a critical framework for addressing the disproportionate environmental burdens faced by marginalized communities, particularly those of racial and ethnic minorities. This paper explores the historical evolution of environmental justice, highlighting its roots in the civil rights movement and its development through grassroots activism. The concept of environmental racism is examined, emphasizing how structural racism contributes to racial health disparities by situating hazardous waste sites and polluting industries in minority neighborhoods. The paper also discusses the role of health advocacy and activism in advancing environmental justice, showcasing successful campaigns that have led to policy changes and improved health outcomes. Looking forward, the paper considers potential directions for the environmental justice movement, including the integration of climate justice and the use of digital tools for community mobilization. By analyzing past achievements and future challenges, this study underscores the importance of sustained advocacy and interdisciplinary collaboration in achieving equitable environmental health outcomes for all communities."}
