{"Abstract": "The integration of mobile technology into public health promotion offers a transformative approach to enhancing health behavior change, particularly in the realm of physical activity. This multidisciplinary study explores the potential of digital health tools, including wearable sensors, to provide culturally relevant and personalized medicine. By leveraging real-time data collection and analysis, these technologies can tailor interventions to individual needs, thereby increasing engagement and efficacy. The research highlights the importance of culturally sensitive design in mobile health applications to ensure accessibility and relevance across diverse populations. Furthermore, the study examines the role of interdisciplinary collaboration in developing comprehensive strategies that incorporate behavioral science, technology, and public health principles. The findings suggest that mobile technology, when effectively utilized, can significantly contribute to public health goals by promoting sustained physical activity and facilitating long-term health behavior change. This paper underscores the need for continued innovation and evaluation in the deployment of mobile health solutions."}
