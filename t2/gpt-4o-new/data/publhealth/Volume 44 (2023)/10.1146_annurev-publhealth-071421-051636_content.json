{"Abstract": "This critical review examines the public health implications of drought within the context of climate change, emphasizing the increasing frequency and severity of drought events. The study synthesizes current literature on drought trends and their direct and indirect impacts on human health, including water scarcity, food insecurity, and the spread of vector-borne diseases. It highlights the heightened vulnerability of certain populations, particularly in low-resource settings, to these health risks. The review also explores the role of climate change in exacerbating drought conditions and the subsequent challenges in managing these risks. Effective drought risk management strategies are discussed, focusing on the integration of climate adaptation and public health policies. The findings underscore the urgent need for comprehensive, interdisciplinary approaches to mitigate the health impacts of drought in a changing climate, ensuring resilience and sustainability in affected communities."}
