{"Abstract": "This study examines the multifaceted impacts of paid family and medical leave (PFML) on worker health, family well-being, and employer outcomes. Utilizing a comprehensive analysis of existing literature and recent empirical data, the research highlights how PFML policies contribute to improved physical and mental health among employees by reducing stress and enhancing recovery times. The study further explores the positive effects on family well-being, emphasizing strengthened familial bonds and increased caregiving quality. Additionally, the research investigates employer outcomes, revealing that PFML can lead to enhanced employee retention, reduced turnover costs, and improved workplace morale. However, the study also addresses potential challenges faced by employers, such as short-term productivity losses and administrative complexities. Overall, the findings underscore the importance of PFML in fostering a healthier, more balanced workforce while promoting sustainable business practices. The study calls for policymakers to consider these benefits in the design and implementation of PFML programs."}
