{"Abstract": "This study explores the multifaceted impact of early childhood education (ECE) on health, equity, and economic outcomes. By synthesizing recent literature, we examine how ECE contributes to improved health metrics, such as cognitive development and long-term physical well-being. The research highlights the role of ECE in promoting equity by providing disadvantaged children with access to quality educational resources, thereby narrowing achievement gaps. Furthermore, the economic implications of ECE are analyzed, demonstrating significant returns on investment through increased future earnings and reduced social costs. The findings underscore the importance of integrating health and equity considerations into ECE policy frameworks to maximize societal benefits. This comprehensive analysis advocates for strategic investments in ECE as a means to foster sustainable economic growth and social equity, emphasizing the need for policymakers to prioritize early educational interventions as a cornerstone of public health and economic strategies."}
