{"Abstract": "This study explores the dehydration dynamics in terrestrial arthropods, focusing on their physiological and behavioral adaptations to water scarcity, a growing concern under climate change. We examine the mechanisms of humidity sensing and water balance regulation, highlighting the role of sensory systems in detecting environmental moisture levels. The research delves into the impact of drought conditions on trophic interactions, revealing how altered water availability influences predator-prey relationships and community structures. By integrating ecological and physiological perspectives, this work underscores the importance of understanding arthropod responses to dehydration in predicting ecosystem resilience. Our findings suggest that adaptive strategies to maintain hydration are crucial for survival, with implications for biodiversity conservation in increasingly arid landscapes. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the complex interplay between climate change and arthropod ecology."}
