{"Abstract": "Diapause, a critical adaptive strategy in insects, plays a pivotal role in the survival and reproduction of species with univoltine and semivoltine life cycles. This study explores the mechanisms and evolutionary significance of diapause in these life cycles, focusing on its role as a bet-hedging strategy in response to environmental variability. The circannual rhythm, a key component of diapause regulation, is examined in the context of seasonal adaptation, highlighting its importance in synchronizing life cycle events with favorable environmental conditions. The study also addresses the impact of climate warming on diapause, emphasizing the potential for shifts in phenotypic plasticity and the occurrence of prolonged diapause as adaptive responses. Through a synthesis of recent literature, this research underscores the complexity of diapause as a multifaceted trait influenced by genetic, environmental, and ecological factors. The findings suggest that understanding diapause dynamics is crucial for predicting the responses of insect populations to climate change, with implications for biodiversity conservation and pest management. This study contributes to the broader understanding of how organisms adapt to changing environments through life cycle strategies, offering insights into the resilience and adaptability of insect species."}
