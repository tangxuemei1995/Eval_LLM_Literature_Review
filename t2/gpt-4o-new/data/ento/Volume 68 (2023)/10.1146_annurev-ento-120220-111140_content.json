{"Abstract": "The spotted lanternfly, Lycorma delicatula, a planthopper native to Asia, poses significant threats to agriculture and ecosystems in the United States. This study examines its biology, focusing on its life cycle, host plant preferences, and invasion potential. The pest's affinity for economically important crops, particularly in viticulture, underscores the urgency for effective management strategies. Current control measures, including chemical, biological, and cultural practices, are evaluated for their efficacy in mitigating its spread. Understanding the ecological impact and developing integrated pest management approaches are crucial for safeguarding affected industries and preventing further expansion of this invasive species."}
