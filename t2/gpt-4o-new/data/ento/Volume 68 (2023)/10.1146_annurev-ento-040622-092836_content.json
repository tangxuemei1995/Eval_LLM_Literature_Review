{"Abstract": "Iron homeostasis is a critical physiological process in insects, essential for maintaining cellular functions and overall health. This review explores the mechanisms by which insects regulate iron levels, focusing on the roles of heme, ferritin, transferrin, and metal transporters. Heme synthesis and degradation pathways are crucial for iron utilization and detoxification, while ferritin serves as the primary iron storage protein, preventing toxicity. Transferrin, although less studied in insects compared to vertebrates, plays a significant role in iron transport and distribution. Metal transporters, including those specific to iron, facilitate the movement of iron across cellular membranes, ensuring its availability for metabolic processes. Understanding these mechanisms provides insights into insect physiology and potential targets for pest control strategies. This review highlights recent advances in the molecular characterization of these components and their regulatory networks."}
