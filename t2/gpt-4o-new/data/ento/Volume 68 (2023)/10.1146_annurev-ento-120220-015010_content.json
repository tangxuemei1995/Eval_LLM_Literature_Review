{"Abstract": "The resurgence of bed bugs, particularly Cimex hemipterus and Cimex lectularius, has become a significant global concern, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of both historical and contemporary control strategies. This review examines the evolution of bed bug management, highlighting the transition from traditional chemical methods to integrated pest management approaches. Historically, chemical control dominated, with insecticides such as DDT and pyrethroids being extensively used. However, resistance development has prompted a shift towards nonchemical methods, including heat treatments, vacuuming, and encasements. Recent advancements emphasize the integration of chemical and nonchemical strategies, utilizing novel insecticides, biological control agents, and public education to enhance efficacy. The review underscores the importance of adaptive management practices in response to the dynamic challenges posed by bed bug infestations. By synthesizing historical insights with contemporary innovations, this study aims to inform effective, sustainable management practices to mitigate the impact of bed bugs globally."}
