{"Abstract": "The early detection of forest wood-boring pests is crucial for effective forest management and conservation. This study explores the use of remote sensing technologies, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellite imagery, to monitor and identify infestations at an early stage. By integrating high-resolution data and advanced image processing techniques, we aim to enhance the accuracy and timeliness of pest detection. Our findings suggest that remote sensing offers a promising tool for forest health monitoring, enabling proactive measures to mitigate the impact of these destructive insects on forest ecosystems."}
