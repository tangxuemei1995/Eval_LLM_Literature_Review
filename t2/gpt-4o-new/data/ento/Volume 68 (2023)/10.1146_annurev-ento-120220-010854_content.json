{"Abstract": "The increasing globalization of trade and travel has heightened the risk of biological invasions by non-native forest insects, posing significant threats to forest ecosystems and economies. This study examines the processes and patterns of these invasions, emphasizing the critical role of pathways in the introduction and spread of invasive species. We explore the effectiveness of current phytosanitary measures and surveillance strategies in mitigating these risks, highlighting both successes and challenges. Predictive models are discussed as tools for anticipating future invasions, yet their application is often hindered by data limitations and ecological complexities. The study identifies key pitfalls in current biosecurity practices, such as inadequate international cooperation and insufficient funding for eradication efforts. By synthesizing recent research, we propose a framework for enhancing forest insect biosecurity, advocating for integrated approaches that combine improved surveillance, rapid response mechanisms, and public awareness campaigns. This comprehensive analysis aims to inform policymakers and stakeholders, fostering more resilient forest management strategies against the backdrop of increasing biological invasions."}
