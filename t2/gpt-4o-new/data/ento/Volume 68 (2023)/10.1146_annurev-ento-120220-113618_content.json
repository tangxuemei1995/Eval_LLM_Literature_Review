{"Abstract": "The postcopulatory behavior of tephritid flies is a critical aspect of their reproductive biology, influencing both natural and applied pest management strategies. This study examines the role of sperm and accessory gland peptides in modulating remating intervals and copulation duration in tephritid species. Accessory gland peptides, transferred during copulation, are hypothesized to affect female receptivity and remating propensity, thereby impacting reproductive success. Understanding these mechanisms is particularly relevant for the sterile insect technique (SIT), a pest control method that relies on the release of sterilized males to reduce wild populations. By elucidating the biochemical and behavioral interactions postcopulation, this research aims to enhance the efficacy of SIT programs. The findings suggest that manipulating accessory gland peptide expression could optimize SIT outcomes by extending the refractory period in females, thereby reducing the likelihood of remating with fertile males."}
