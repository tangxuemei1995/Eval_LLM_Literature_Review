{"Abstract": "The integration of chemical ecology into conservation biological control offers promising avenues for enhancing the effectiveness of parasitoids in agroecosystems. This study explores the multifaceted interactions between floral resources and parasitoids, focusing on the roles of floral volatiles and nectar-associated microorganisms. Floral volatiles serve as critical cues for parasitoids, aiding in host location and enhancing foraging efficiency. Additionally, nectar-associated microorganisms can influence the nutritional quality of floral resources, thereby affecting parasitoid fitness and longevity. The presence of hyperparasitoids, however, complicates these interactions by potentially disrupting parasitoid populations. Understanding the chemical ecology of these interactions is crucial for optimizing floral resource management in conservation biological control strategies. By selecting and managing floral resources that enhance parasitoid performance while minimizing hyperparasitoid impacts, agroecosystems can achieve more sustainable pest control. This research underscores the importance of a holistic approach to agroecosystem management, integrating chemical cues and microbial interactions to bolster the ecological services provided by parasitoids."}
