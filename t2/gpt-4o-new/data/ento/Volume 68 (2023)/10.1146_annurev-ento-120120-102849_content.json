{"Abstract": "The study of arthropod and pathogen damage on both fossil and modern plants provides critical insights into the origins and evolution of herbivory on land. This research examines the patterns and processes of plant damage across significant geological periods, including the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) and Permian–Triassic (P–Tr) ecologic crises, as well as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). By analyzing damage types and functional feeding groups, this study aims to elucidate the adaptive strategies of arthropods and pathogens in response to environmental changes on a continental scale. The fossil record reveals a complex history of plant-arthropod interactions, highlighting periods of increased herbivory and diversification of feeding strategies. These interactions are crucial for understanding the resilience and adaptability of plant communities during periods of ecological upheaval. The research also explores the continuity and transformation of these interactions from the fossil record to modern ecosystems, providing a comprehensive view of the evolutionary dynamics of herbivory. By integrating paleontological data with modern ecological studies, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of the co-evolutionary processes that have shaped terrestrial ecosystems. The findings underscore the importance of historical perspectives in predicting future ecological responses to climate change and other anthropogenic pressures."}
