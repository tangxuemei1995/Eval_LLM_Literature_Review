{"Abstract": "The resilience of plant–pollinator networks is a critical component of ecosystem stability, particularly in the face of global environmental change. This study examines the robustness of mutualistic networks, focusing on their ability to withstand and adapt to ecosystem shifts. By analyzing a diverse range of plant–pollinator interactions across various biomes, we assess the structural properties that contribute to network resilience. Our findings indicate that network robustness is significantly influenced by species diversity and the presence of generalist species, which act as stabilizing agents within the network. Additionally, we explore the impact of anthropogenic pressures, such as habitat fragmentation and climate change, on these networks. The results suggest that while some networks exhibit remarkable resilience, others are highly susceptible to disruption, leading to potential cascading effects on ecosystem services. This research underscores the importance of conserving biodiversity and maintaining ecological connectivity to enhance the resilience of plant–pollinator networks, thereby ensuring the sustainability of essential ecosystem functions in a rapidly changing world."}
