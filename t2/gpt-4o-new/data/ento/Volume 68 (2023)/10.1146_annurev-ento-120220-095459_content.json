{"Abstract": "Insects exhibit a remarkable array of vibrational signaling systems, which play crucial roles in communication, mating, and survival. This study explores the functional diversity of these systems, focusing on biotremology and substrate-borne communication. By examining various signaling contexts, we highlight the evolutionary adaptations in vibrosensory mechanisms that enable insects to effectively transmit and receive signals through different substrates. The integration of vibrational signals with other modalities, such as visual and chemical cues, underscores the complexity of multimodal signaling strategies. Understanding these systems not only provides insights into the evolutionary biology of insects but also offers potential applications in pest management. By manipulating vibrational signals, novel, environmentally friendly pest control methods could be developed, reducing reliance on chemical pesticides and promoting sustainable agricultural practices."}
