{"Abstract": "Stingless bees (Apidae: Apinae: Meliponini) are vital components of tropical ecosystems, playing crucial roles in pollination and biodiversity maintenance. This study explores the ecological dynamics of stingless bees, focusing on their foraging behavior, resource utilization, and social structure. Emphasizing their significance in bee-keeping, the research highlights the production of honey and pollen, which are economically and nutritionally important. The bees' unique use of resin for nest construction and defense is examined, showcasing their adaptability and resilience. The study also addresses the challenges faced by stingless bees, including habitat loss and climate change, which threaten their populations and the ecosystems they support. By integrating ecological, economic, and conservation perspectives, this research underscores the importance of protecting stingless bees to sustain tropical biodiversity and enhance sustainable agricultural practices. The findings aim to inform conservation strategies and promote sustainable bee-keeping practices in tropical regions."}
