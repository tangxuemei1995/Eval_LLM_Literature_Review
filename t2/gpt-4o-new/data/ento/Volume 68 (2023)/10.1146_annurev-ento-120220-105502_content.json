{"Abstract": "The adoption of Bt crops in the United States has significantly transformed the management of insect pests, particularly in corn and cotton production. Bt crops, genetically engineered to express Bacillus thuringiensis toxins, target key pest groups such as Lepidoptera and Coleoptera, reducing reliance on chemical insecticides and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. This paper reviews the impact of Bt crops on pest populations, focusing on the effectiveness against major pests and the development of insect resistance. The implementation of insect resistance management (IRM) strategies, including the refuge strategy, is critical to prolonging the efficacy of Bt crops. The refuge strategy, which involves planting non-Bt crop areas to maintain susceptible pest populations, has been a cornerstone in delaying resistance. This review synthesizes current research on the successes and challenges of Bt crop deployment, emphasizing the need for integrated pest management approaches to ensure long-term sustainability and effectiveness in pest control."}
