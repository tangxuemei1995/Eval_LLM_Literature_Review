{"Abstract": "The Paleozoic era marks a critical period in the evolutionary history of insects, characterized by significant diversification and morphological innovation. This study explores the diversity, form, and postembryonic development of Paleozoic insects, focusing on the Hexapoda and Insecta clades. By examining fossil records and employing phylogenetic analyses, we investigate the deep divergences that shaped early insect evolution. Our findings highlight the emergence of key functional morphologies and the evolution of metamorphosis, which facilitated ecological adaptability and niche expansion. The research underscores the complexity of insect development during this era, revealing insights into the evolutionary mechanisms that drove the diversification of form and function. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the evolutionary trajectories that have led to the vast diversity of modern insects, emphasizing the importance of Paleozoic innovations in shaping contemporary insect lineages."}
