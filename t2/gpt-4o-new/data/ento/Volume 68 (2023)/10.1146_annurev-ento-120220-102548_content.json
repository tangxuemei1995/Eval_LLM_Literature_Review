{"Abstract": "Spodoptera frugiperda, commonly known as the fall armyworm, is a highly invasive pest with significant agricultural impact worldwide. This review synthesizes current knowledge on its ecology, evolution, and management strategies. Taxonomically, S. frugiperda is divided into two strains, corn and rice, which exhibit distinct host plant preferences and geographical distributions. Population genetics studies reveal complex patterns of gene flow and strain hybridization, complicating management efforts. The pest's adaptability is further enhanced by its diverse host plant use, allowing rapid colonization of new environments. Mate attraction mechanisms, including pheromone communication, play a crucial role in its reproductive success and are potential targets for control strategies. Insecticide resistance is a growing concern, necessitating integrated pest management approaches that combine chemical, biological, and cultural methods. Understanding the evolutionary dynamics and ecological interactions of S. frugiperda is essential for developing sustainable management options to mitigate its impact on global agriculture."}
