{"Abstract": "Phoresy, a form of symbiosis where one organism uses another for transportation, is a critical yet often overlooked aspect of mite ecology. This study explores the complex relationships between phoretic mites (Acari) and their hosts, highlighting the conditional nature of these interactions. While traditionally viewed as a simple dispersal mechanism, phoresy can encompass a spectrum of relationships from mutualism to parasitism, depending on environmental and biological contexts. By examining various host-mite pairings, this research elucidates how phoresy can influence host fitness, mite survival, and broader ecological dynamics. The findings suggest that phoresy is not merely a 'free ride' but a multifaceted interaction with significant implications for the evolution and adaptation of both mites and their hosts. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for comprehending the ecological roles of mites and their impact on host populations and ecosystems."}
