{"Abstract": "The silkworm, Bombyx mori, is a crucial organism in sericulture, yet its susceptibility to the Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) poses significant challenges to silk production. This study investigates the mechanisms underlying silkworm resistance to BmNPV, focusing on the identification and characterization of resistant genes, virus-host interactions, and the genetic basis of resistance. Through comprehensive genetic analysis, we have identified several candidate genes associated with enhanced resistance to BmNPV. These genes are involved in various biological pathways, including immune response modulation and cellular defense mechanisms. Advanced techniques such as quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been employed to pinpoint the precise locations of these resistance genes within the silkworm genome. Our findings reveal complex interactions between the virus and host, highlighting the role of specific genetic loci in conferring resistance. Furthermore, the study explores the potential for breeding silkworm strains with enhanced antiviral properties by leveraging these genetic insights. By integrating traditional breeding methods with modern genomic tools, we propose a strategic framework for developing silkworm lines that exhibit robust resistance to BmNPV. This research not only advances our understanding of virus-host dynamics in silkworms but also provides a foundation for sustainable sericulture practices through the development of resistant silkworm breeds. The implications of these findings extend to improving silk yield and quality, thereby benefiting the global silk industry."}
