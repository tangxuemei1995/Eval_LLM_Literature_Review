{"Abstract": "This study critically examines the intersection of postcolonial language policy and planning (LPP) with the concept of the modern nation-state, focusing on Southern perspectives, particularly in the context of Sudan. The research highlights how traditional LPP frameworks, often rooted in Western-centric notions of statehood, inadequately address the complexities of postcolonial nations. By employing a postcolonial approach, the study reveals the limitations of conventional LPP in accommodating the diverse linguistic and cultural landscapes of postcolonial states like Sudan. It argues that the imposition of a singular national language policy often exacerbates ethnic tensions and undermines social cohesion. The research advocates for a more nuanced understanding of LPP that incorporates indigenous knowledge systems and recognizes the fluidity of linguistic identities in postcolonial settings. Through a case study of Sudan, the paper illustrates how Southern perspectives can inform more inclusive and context-sensitive language policies that better reflect the realities of postcolonial nation-states, ultimately challenging the rigid boundaries of the modern state paradigm."}
