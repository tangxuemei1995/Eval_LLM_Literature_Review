{"Abstract": "Recent advances in the study of Chinese developmental dyslexia have provided significant insights into its linguistic, cognitive, and neurobiological underpinnings. This review synthesizes current research on the unique linguistic profiles associated with dyslexia in Chinese, highlighting the challenges posed by the logographic nature of the script. Studies reveal distinct brain abnormalities in dyslexic individuals, with atypical activation patterns in regions associated with phonological and orthographic processing. Genetic research has identified several susceptibility genes, suggesting a complex interplay between genetic predispositions and environmental factors. The findings underscore both language-universal and language-specific aspects of dyslexia, emphasizing the need for tailored diagnostic and intervention strategies. This body of work not only enhances our understanding of dyslexia in the context of Chinese language but also contributes to the broader discourse on reading disorders across diverse linguistic systems."}
