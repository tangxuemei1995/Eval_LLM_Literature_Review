{"Abstract": "The actuation problem in linguistics refers to the challenge of understanding why certain sound changes occur in specific languages or dialects at particular times, while others do not. This study explores the actuation problem through the lens of incrementation and propagation, focusing on the role of individual differences in cognitive processing styles. By employing agent-based modeling, we simulate linguistic communities to investigate how variations in cognitive processing among individuals can influence the initiation and spread of sound changes. Our model incorporates parameters that reflect individual differences, such as attention to detail and adaptability, which are hypothesized to affect linguistic behavior. The results suggest that individuals with certain cognitive processing styles are more likely to initiate sound changes, while others play a crucial role in their propagation. Furthermore, the interaction between agents with diverse cognitive profiles can lead to complex patterns of sound change, highlighting the importance of social dynamics in linguistic evolution. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the actuation problem by integrating cognitive and social factors, offering a novel perspective on how individual differences can drive linguistic innovation. The findings have implications for theories of language change, suggesting that cognitive diversity within a population is a key factor in the emergence and dissemination of new linguistic forms."}
