{"Abstract": "This study investigates the impact of socioeconomic status (SES) on language development and communication, focusing on the disparities in linguistic input and processing among children from diverse SES backgrounds. By analyzing parental input and its influence on syntactic parsing and language acquisition, the research highlights the critical role of early language exposure in shaping cognitive and communicative competencies. Utilizing a sociolinguistic framework, the study examines how variations in language environments contribute to meaningful differences in language processing skills. The findings underscore the importance of addressing SES-related disparities to foster equitable language development opportunities. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical data, this research provides insights into the mechanisms by which SES influences language learning, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to support children from lower SES backgrounds. The study calls for policy and educational strategies that enhance language-rich interactions to mitigate the effects of SES on language development."}
