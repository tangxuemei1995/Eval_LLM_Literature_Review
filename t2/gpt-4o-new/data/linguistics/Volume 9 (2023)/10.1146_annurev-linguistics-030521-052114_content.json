{"Abstract": "This study explores the assessment of second language speaking proficiency, emphasizing the role of interaction in evaluating language skills. Speaking proficiency is a critical component of language competence, yet its assessment poses unique challenges due to its dynamic and interactive nature. Traditional assessment methods often fail to capture the complexity of spoken interaction, necessitating more nuanced approaches. This research reviews current methodologies and proposes a framework that integrates interactional competence as a core element of speaking assessments. By analyzing various assessment tools and their effectiveness in measuring interactive speaking skills, the study highlights the importance of context, task design, and rater training in achieving reliable and valid assessments. The findings suggest that incorporating interactional elements can enhance the accuracy of proficiency evaluations, providing a more comprehensive understanding of a learner's speaking abilities. This research contributes to the development of more effective language assessment practices, with implications for educators and policymakers."}
