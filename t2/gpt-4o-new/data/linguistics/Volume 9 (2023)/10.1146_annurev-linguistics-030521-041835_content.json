{"Abstract": "This study investigates adjective ordering preferences across diverse languages, exploring the underlying principles governing word order in modification structures. By analyzing cross-linguistic data, we identify consistent patterns and regularities in how adjectives are sequenced, revealing both universal tendencies and language-specific variations. Our findings suggest that cognitive and semantic factors significantly influence adjective ordering, with implications for understanding linguistic typology and syntax. This research contributes to the broader field of language universals, offering insights into the cognitive processes that shape language structure and the potential for developing more accurate models of natural language processing."}
