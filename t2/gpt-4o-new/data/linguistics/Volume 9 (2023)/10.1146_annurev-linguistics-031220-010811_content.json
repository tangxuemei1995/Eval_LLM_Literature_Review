{"Abstract": "The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework is a computational model that integrates probabilistic reasoning with linguistic pragmatics to explain how speakers and listeners use context to infer meaning. This framework posits that communication is a cooperative activity where speakers choose utterances based on their beliefs about listeners' interpretations, while listeners infer speakers' intentions by considering possible alternatives. RSA combines insights from experimental pragmatics and semantics, providing a formal structure to model how context influences language understanding. By employing probabilistic models, RSA captures the nuances of human communication, offering predictions that align with empirical data from experimental studies. This approach has advanced the field of computational pragmatics by enabling the simulation of complex linguistic phenomena, such as implicature and reference resolution. The RSA framework thus serves as a powerful tool for exploring the interplay between language, cognition, and context, contributing to a deeper understanding of human communication processes."}
