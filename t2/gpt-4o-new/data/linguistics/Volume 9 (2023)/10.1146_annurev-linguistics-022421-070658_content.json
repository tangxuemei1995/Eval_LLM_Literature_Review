{"Abstract": "This study explores the syntactic phenomenon of hyperraising, where elements appear to move out of finite clauses, challenging traditional constraints on syntactic movement. Hyperraising is examined through the lens of three primary theoretical frameworks: defectiveness/nonphase analyses, deactivation analyses, and phase-edge analyses. Defectiveness/nonphase analyses propose that certain finite clauses lack the structural integrity to act as barriers to movement, allowing elements to raise out. Deactivation analyses suggest that specific syntactic features deactivate the clause's barrier properties, facilitating movement. Phase-edge analyses focus on the role of phase edges as potential escape hatches for elements undergoing movement. This research also investigates crosslinguistic variation in hyperraising, highlighting how different languages exhibit unique patterns and constraints. By comparing data from diverse linguistic contexts, the study aims to refine our understanding of the conditions under which hyperraising occurs and its implications for syntactic theory. The findings contribute to ongoing debates about the nature of syntactic phases and the universality of movement constraints, offering new insights into the flexibility and limits of syntactic structures."}
