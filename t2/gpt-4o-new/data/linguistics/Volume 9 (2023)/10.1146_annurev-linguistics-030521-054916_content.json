{"Abstract": "This study examines the complex sociolinguistic landscape of North Africa, focusing on the recognition and institutionalization of Tamazight amidst the region's multilingual and multicultural dynamics. Historically marginalized due to colonization and the dominance of Arabic and DƒÅrija, Tamazight's revitalization presents both opportunities and challenges. The research explores the interplay between language policy, identity, and cultural heritage, highlighting efforts to integrate Tamazight into educational and governmental frameworks. It also addresses the socio-political implications of language revitalization, including resistance and acceptance within diverse communities. The findings underscore the need for inclusive policies that respect linguistic diversity while fostering regional unity and cultural preservation."}
