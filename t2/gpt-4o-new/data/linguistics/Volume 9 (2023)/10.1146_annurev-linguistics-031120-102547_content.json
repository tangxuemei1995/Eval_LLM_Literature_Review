{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of impersonal pronouns and first-person perspective, focusing on their role in attitude reports and the expression of de se thoughts. Impersonal pronouns, often used to convey general truths or norms, can obscure the speaker's personal involvement, yet they also serve as a linguistic tool to express self-referential attitudes indirectly. By examining the indexicality inherent in impersonal pronouns, this research highlights their dual function in maintaining genericity while simultaneously anchoring statements to the speaker's perspective. Through a detailed analysis of linguistic data, the study reveals how impersonal pronouns can subtly shift the narrative perspective, influencing the interpretation of attitude reports. The findings suggest that the use of impersonal pronouns in discourse is not merely a stylistic choice but a strategic mechanism to navigate between personal and impersonal viewpoints. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of how language structures mediate the expression of self-related thoughts and the broader implications for theories of indexicality and perspective-taking."}
