{"Abstract": "This study explores computational models of anaphora, focusing on anaphora resolution and coreference within natural language processing. We examine various corpora designed for anaphora tasks, highlighting their role in training and evaluating models. The paper delves into neural models for coreference, emphasizing advancements in deep learning techniques that enhance resolution accuracy. Additionally, we address bridging reference and discourse deixis, discussing their implications for understanding complex linguistic structures. The Winograd Schema Challenge is analyzed as a benchmark for evaluating model performance in resolving ambiguous references. Our findings suggest that integrating diverse linguistic features and context-aware mechanisms significantly improves anaphora resolution, paving the way for more sophisticated discourse analysis in computational linguistics."}
