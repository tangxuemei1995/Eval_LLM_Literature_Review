{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricacies of verb classification across multiple languages, a critical component in enhancing multilingual natural language processing (NLP) systems. By leveraging knowledge augmentation techniques, we aim to improve the performance of neural models in understanding and processing verbs in diverse linguistic contexts. Our approach integrates crowdsourcing to gather a wide array of verb usage examples from native speakers, ensuring a rich and varied dataset. This data is then used to train and fine-tune neural models, allowing them to better capture the nuances of verb semantics and syntax across languages. The research highlights the challenges and opportunities in creating robust multilingual NLP systems, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive verb classification. Our findings suggest that combining crowdsourced data with advanced neural architectures can significantly enhance the accuracy and applicability of NLP models in multilingual settings, paving the way for more effective cross-linguistic communication tools."}
