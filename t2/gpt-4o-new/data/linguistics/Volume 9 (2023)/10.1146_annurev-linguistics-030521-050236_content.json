{"Abstract": "Heritage languages, often acquired in early childhood within familial contexts, face unique challenges and opportunities in their maintenance and revitalization. This study explores the dynamic processes of language acquisition, attrition, and reactivation among heritage speakers, who typically experience a shift in linguistic dominance towards the societal language. The phenomenon of L1 attrition, where the heritage language is partially or fully lost, is examined in relation to factors such as age of acquisition, frequency of use, and sociocultural influences. The research further investigates the potential for reactivation and relearning of heritage languages, highlighting the cognitive and emotional benefits of bilingualism. Through a comprehensive review of current literature and case studies, this paper underscores the importance of educational and community support in fostering heritage language proficiency. The findings suggest that strategic interventions can facilitate the regaining of heritage languages, thereby enriching cultural identity and promoting linguistic diversity. This work contributes to the broader understanding of bilingualism and language preservation."}
