{"Abstract": "Speech prosody, encompassing the rhythm, stress, and intonation of speech, plays a crucial role in communication and is often disrupted in individuals with mental disorders. This study explores the multifaceted relationship between mental disorders and speech prosody, focusing on prosody recognition and production, as well as pragmatic and affective prosody. By reviewing recent advancements in prosody analysis, the research highlights how deviations in prosodic features can serve as potential biomarkers for various mental health conditions, including depression, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorders. The study examines the underlying neural mechanisms that contribute to prosodic impairments and discusses the implications for diagnosis and therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of developing robust prosody recognition technologies to enhance clinical assessments and personalized treatment plans. The findings underscore the need for interdisciplinary approaches combining linguistics, psychology, and computational methods to advance our understanding of prosody in mental disorders. This research contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the integration of speech prosody analysis in mental health diagnostics and interventions."}
