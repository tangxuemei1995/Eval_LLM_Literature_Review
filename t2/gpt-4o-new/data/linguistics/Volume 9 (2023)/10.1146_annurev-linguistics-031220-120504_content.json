{"Abstract": "The field of language documentation has witnessed significant technological advancements, enhancing both resource creation and mobilization. Recent innovations have introduced sophisticated tools and platforms that streamline the collection, analysis, and dissemination of linguistic data. These technologies facilitate the documentation of endangered languages by enabling more efficient data gathering and processing, often through mobile applications and cloud-based solutions. Additionally, advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence have improved the accuracy and accessibility of language resources, fostering greater collaboration among linguists, native speakers, and communities. This paper reviews the latest technological developments in language documentation, highlighting their impact on preserving linguistic diversity and promoting sustainable language practices. By leveraging these technologies, researchers can create comprehensive language resources that are more easily mobilized for educational and revitalization efforts."}
