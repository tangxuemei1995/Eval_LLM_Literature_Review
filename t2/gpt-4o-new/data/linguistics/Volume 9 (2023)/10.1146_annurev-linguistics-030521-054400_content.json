{"Abstract": "Effective health care communication is pivotal in shaping treatment outcomes, as it influences patient satisfaction, adherence to medical advice, and overall health results. This study explores the dynamics of physicianâ€“patient interactions, employing conversation analysis to dissect the nuances of negotiation and decision-making processes. By examining social interactions within clinical settings, the research highlights how communication strategies impact the mutual understanding and trust between patients and healthcare providers. The findings suggest that successful negotiation and shared decision-making are contingent upon the physician's ability to engage in empathetic listening and clear articulation of medical information. Furthermore, the study underscores the importance of tailoring communication styles to individual patient needs, thereby enhancing the therapeutic alliance. This research contributes to the growing body of evidence advocating for improved communication training in medical education to optimize treatment outcomes and patient well-being."}
