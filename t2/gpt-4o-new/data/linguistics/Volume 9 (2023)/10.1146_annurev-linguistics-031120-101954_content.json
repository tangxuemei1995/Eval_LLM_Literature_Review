{"Abstract": "This study investigates the phenomenon of prosodic prominence across diverse languages, focusing on the interplay between pitch accent, lexical stress, and their roles in conveying meaning. Utilizing the Rapid Prosody Transcription method, we analyze how listeners perceive and annotate prosodic features, providing insights into the cognitive processing of prosody. The research draws on metrical phonology to explore the structural underpinnings of prosodic prominence, examining how different languages employ these features to achieve communicative goals. By comparing languages with varying prosodic typologies, we aim to identify universal patterns and language-specific variations in the realization of prosodic prominence. Our findings suggest that while there are commonalities in the use of pitch and stress to signal prominence, the specific implementation and perception of these features are influenced by language-specific phonological rules and cultural factors. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of prosodic systems and their role in language processing, offering implications for theories of phonology and cross-linguistic prosodic analysis. The results underscore the importance of considering both universal and language-specific elements in the study of prosody."}
