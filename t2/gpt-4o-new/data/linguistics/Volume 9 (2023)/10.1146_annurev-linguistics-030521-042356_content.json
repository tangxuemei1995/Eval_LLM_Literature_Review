{"Abstract": "This study explores the complex interplay of unity and diversity within the Altaic language family through the lenses of diachronic, areal, and contextual linguistics. By examining historical language contacts and typological interactions, the research aims to unravel the intricate web of linguistic features shared among Altaic languages, while also highlighting their distinct characteristics. The analysis draws on a comprehensive dataset, incorporating both historical texts and contemporary linguistic data, to trace the evolution and diffusion of linguistic traits across the Altaic region. The findings suggest that while there is a significant degree of typological convergence due to prolonged contact and shared historical experiences, each language retains unique elements that reflect its individual development. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of how languages within a family can simultaneously exhibit unity and diversity, offering insights into broader processes of language change and interaction."}
