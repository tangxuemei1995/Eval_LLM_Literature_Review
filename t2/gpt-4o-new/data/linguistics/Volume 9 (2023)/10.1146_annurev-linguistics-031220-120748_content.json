{"Abstract": "This study explores the interplay between serialism and opacity within phonological theory, focusing on the frameworks of Optimality Theory (OT) and Harmonic Serialism (HS). Opacity, a phenomenon where surface forms obscure underlying representations, poses challenges to parallelism in OT, which traditionally evaluates candidates simultaneously. By contrast, HS introduces a serial approach, processing phonological transformations in a stepwise manner, potentially offering a more nuanced account of opaque interactions. This research examines how rule ordering in HS can address opacity issues that parallel OT struggles to resolve. Through comparative analysis, the study highlights the advantages of serialism in capturing complex phonological patterns, suggesting that HS provides a more flexible and accurate model for understanding opacity. The findings contribute to ongoing debates about the efficacy of serial versus parallel processing in phonological theory, offering insights into the mechanisms underlying phonological opacity and the potential for hybrid models."}
