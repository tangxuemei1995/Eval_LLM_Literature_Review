{"Abstract": "This study explores effective methodologies for analyzing psycholinguistic data, emphasizing the integration of Bayesian methods in experimental linguistics. Traditional hypothesis testing often falls short in addressing the complexities and uncertainties inherent in linguistic data. By employing Bayes factors, researchers can more robustly quantify evidence for or against hypotheses, offering a nuanced understanding of linguistic phenomena. This paper discusses the advantages of Bayesian approaches over frequentist methods, particularly in terms of uncertainty quantification and interpretability. Through case studies and simulations, we demonstrate how Bayesian techniques can enhance the reliability and validity of linguistic data analysis. Our findings suggest that adopting these methods can lead to more informed and precise conclusions, ultimately advancing the field of psycholinguistics and its experimental practices."}
