{"Abstract": "Environmental Linguistics is an emerging interdisciplinary field that explores the intricate relationship between language, ecology, and cultural identity. This study delves into the role of linguistic diversity in fostering biodiversity, emphasizing the importance of indigenous languages in preserving ecological knowledge. By examining the case of Tuva, a region rich in native science and environmental intelligence, the research highlights how traditional ecological knowledge is embedded in local languages, offering insights into sustainable practices. The paper also addresses the decolonization of environmental narratives, advocating for the inclusion of indigenous perspectives in global environmental discourse. Through a comprehensive analysis of linguistic practices in Tuva, the study underscores the potential of environmental linguistics to contribute to biodiversity conservation and cultural resilience. This research calls for a paradigm shift in environmental policy, recognizing the value of linguistic diversity as a crucial component of ecological sustainability."}
