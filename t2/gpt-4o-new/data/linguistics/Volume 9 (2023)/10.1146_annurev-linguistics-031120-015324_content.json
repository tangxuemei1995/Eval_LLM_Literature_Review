{"Abstract": "The field of linguistics, like other scientific disciplines, is increasingly confronted with ethical considerations that impact research practices and outcomes. This paper explores the multifaceted nature of ethics in linguistics, focusing on ethical praxis, regulatory ethics, relational ethics, and scientific validity. Ethical praxis in linguistics involves the application of ethical principles in research design and implementation, ensuring respect for participants and communities. Regulatory ethics addresses compliance with institutional and legal standards, safeguarding the rights and welfare of subjects. Relational ethics emphasizes the importance of relationships between researchers and participants, advocating for mutual respect and understanding. Scientific validity is scrutinized through an ethical lens, questioning how ethical considerations influence the reliability and credibility of linguistic research. By examining these dimensions, the paper aims to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and integrating ethics into linguistic research, ultimately enhancing the discipline's integrity and societal impact."}
