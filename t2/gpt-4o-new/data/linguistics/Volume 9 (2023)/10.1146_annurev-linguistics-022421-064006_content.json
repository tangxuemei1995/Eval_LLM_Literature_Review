{"Abstract": "This study explores the typology of reciprocal constructions, focusing on their morphosyntactic properties and valency changes across languages. Reciprocal constructions, which express mutual actions or relations, often exhibit symmetry in their syntactic and semantic structures. By analyzing a diverse set of languages, this research identifies common patterns and variations in the expression of reciprocity, highlighting the role of morphological markers and syntactic strategies. The study categorizes these constructions based on their valency adjustments, examining how languages encode reciprocal meaning through reduction or reorganization of argument structure. This typological analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between syntax and semantics in reciprocal expressions, offering insights into the universality and diversity of linguistic structures."}
