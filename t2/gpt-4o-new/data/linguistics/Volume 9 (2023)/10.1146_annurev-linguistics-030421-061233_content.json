{"Abstract": "This study delves into animal communication through the lenses of linguistic and cognitive sciences, drawing on historical and contemporary perspectives. By examining the works of pioneers like Washburn and Ladygina-Kohts, the research highlights the evolution of understanding in comparative cognition. The analysis incorporates Grice's theories on meaning and intention, exploring how these concepts apply to non-human communication systems. Central to the discussion are the principles of duality of patterning and generativity, which are traditionally associated with human language. The study investigates whether these linguistic features are present in animal communication, offering insights into the cognitive capabilities of various species. By bridging linguistic theory and cognitive science, this research aims to enhance our understanding of the complexities and limitations of animal communication, providing a comprehensive framework for future studies in the field. The findings suggest a nuanced continuum of communicative abilities across species, challenging the boundaries between human and animal communication."}
