{"Abstract": "Compositionality, a fundamental principle in linguistics, posits that the meaning of complex expressions derives from their parts and the rules used to combine them. In computational linguistics, this principle is crucial for tasks like semantic parsing and language understanding. Recent advancements in neural networks and neurosymbolic models have enhanced the ability to capture compositional structures, offering improved performance in natural language processing applications. This paper reviews the integration of compositionality in computational models, highlighting the strengths and limitations of current approaches. We discuss the implications for future research, emphasizing the potential of hybrid models to bridge the gap between symbolic and connectionist paradigms."}
