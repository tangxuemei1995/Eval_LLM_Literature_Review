{"Abstract": "Homesign systems, developed by deaf individuals without access to formal sign language education, present a unique opportunity to explore language emergence and sociolinguistic dynamics. This study delves into the contested issues surrounding homesign, examining its role as a precursor to fully-fledged sign languages and its implications for linguistic ethnography. By analyzing the sociolinguistic environments in which homesign arises, we aim to understand the factors influencing its development and sustainability. The research highlights the tension between homesign as a personal communication system and its potential to evolve into a community language. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, this paper seeks to contribute to the broader discourse on language development, identity, and the rights of deaf individuals to access and develop their own linguistic resources."}
