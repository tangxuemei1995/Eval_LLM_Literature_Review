{"Abstract": "Tissue morphogenesis is a complex process orchestrated by dynamic interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM). This study explores the pivotal roles of cell adhesion molecules, such as integrins and cadherins, in mediating these interactions. Integrins facilitate cell-ECM adhesion, influencing cellular responses to mechanical cues and interfacial tension, while cadherins are crucial for cell-cell adhesion, maintaining tissue integrity and facilitating communication. The basement membrane, a specialized ECM component, provides structural support and biochemical signals essential for tissue architecture. Our research highlights how variations in interfacial tension and ECM composition can modulate cell behavior, driving morphogenetic processes. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions, we aim to advance our understanding of tissue development and regeneration. This knowledge could inform therapeutic strategies for tissue engineering and repair, emphasizing the importance of integrin and cadherin pathways in maintaining tissue homeostasis and function."}
