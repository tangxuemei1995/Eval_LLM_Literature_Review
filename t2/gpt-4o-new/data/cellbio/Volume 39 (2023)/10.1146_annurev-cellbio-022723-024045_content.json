{"Abstract": "This study employs advanced fluorescence microscopy to track the dynamic lifecycle of mRNAs within single cells. By visualizing transcription, splicing, RNA localization, translation, and mRNA decay, we elucidate the intricate processes governing mRNA fate. Our findings reveal critical insights into the spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression, highlighting the interplay between mRNA synthesis and degradation. This comprehensive analysis enhances our understanding of cellular function and the molecular mechanisms underlying mRNA dynamics, offering potential implications for therapeutic strategies targeting gene expression."}
