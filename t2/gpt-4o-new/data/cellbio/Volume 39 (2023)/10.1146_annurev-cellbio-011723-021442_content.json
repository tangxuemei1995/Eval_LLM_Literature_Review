{"Abstract": "The endometrium is a dynamic tissue that undergoes cyclical regeneration and remodeling during menstruation and pregnancy. This study explores the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying endometrial regeneration and fibrosis, with a focus on the roles of stem cells and signaling pathways. We examine how endometrial stem cells contribute to tissue repair and regeneration, and how dysregulation in these processes can lead to pathological conditions such as Asherman syndrome and intrauterine adhesions. The interplay between hormonal signals and local cellular environments during parturition is also analyzed to understand their impact on endometrial health. Our findings highlight the potential for therapeutic interventions targeting stem cell pathways to enhance regeneration and prevent fibrosis. This research provides insights into the balance between regeneration and fibrosis in the endometrium, offering new avenues for the treatment of reproductive disorders associated with impaired endometrial function."}
