{"Abstract": "Transfer RNA (tRNA) dysregulation has emerged as a critical factor in the pathogenesis of both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. This review explores the multifaceted roles of tRNA, focusing on its synthesis, modification, and degradation processes. Key enzymes such as aminoacyl tRNA synthetases and tRNA-modifying enzymes are highlighted for their roles in maintaining tRNA homeostasis. Disruptions in tRNA splicing and modifications can lead to aberrant protein synthesis, contributing to disease phenotypes. Additionally, the role of angiogenin in tRNA cleavage and its impact on the integrated stress response is examined, providing insights into cellular stress mechanisms. Recent studies suggest that tRNA fragments may serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets in neurological disorders. Understanding the complex interplay between tRNA dynamics and neuronal function could pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies in treating these debilitating diseases. This review underscores the need for further research into tRNA-related pathways in neurobiology."}
