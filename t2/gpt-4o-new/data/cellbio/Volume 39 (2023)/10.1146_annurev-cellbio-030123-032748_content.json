{"Abstract": "The tubulin code, a complex system of tubulin isoforms and posttranslational modifications (PTMs), plays a crucial role in the functional diversity of microtubules, which are essential components of the cytoskeleton. This review explores the molecular intricacies of the tubulin code, focusing on the various PTMs such as detyrosination, tyrosination, acetylation, glutamylation, and glycylation, and their impact on microtubule dynamics and interactions. By examining the differential expression of tubulin isoforms and the spatial-temporal regulation of PTMs, we highlight their significance in cellular processes such as intracellular transport, cell division, and signaling pathways. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of dysregulated tubulin modifications in the pathogenesis of diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Understanding the tubulin code not only provides insights into fundamental cellular mechanisms but also opens avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting microtubule-associated pathologies. This comprehensive analysis underscores the potential of the tubulin code as a biomarker and a target for drug development."}
