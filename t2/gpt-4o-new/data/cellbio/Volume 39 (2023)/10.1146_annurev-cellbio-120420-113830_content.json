{"Abstract": "The study of tissue biology is undergoing a transformative shift as researchers seek a new paradigm that transcends traditional cell type classifications. This paper explores the intricate organization of tissues through the lens of tissue modules, emphasizing the dynamic relationships between cells rather than static categories. By examining the evolutionary processes and self-organizing principles that govern tissue architecture, we propose a framework that integrates cellular interactions and functional modules. This approach not only enhances our understanding of tissue complexity but also provides insights into the adaptive mechanisms that drive tissue evolution. By redefining cell relations and categories, this paradigm shift has the potential to revolutionize our comprehension of biological systems, offering novel perspectives on tissue development, regeneration, and disease. Our findings underscore the importance of interdisciplinary research in unraveling the complexities of tissue biology and advancing biomedical science."}
