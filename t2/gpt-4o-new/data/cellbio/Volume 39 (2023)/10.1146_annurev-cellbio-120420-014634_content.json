{"Abstract": "RBG motif bridge-like lipid transport proteins (BLTPs) such as VPS13, ATG2, tweek, hobbit, and SHIP164 play crucial roles in lipid transport across cellular membranes, impacting various cellular processes. These proteins are characterized by their unique RBG motifs, which facilitate the bridging of lipid molecules between membranes, thus maintaining lipid homeostasis. Recent structural studies have provided insights into the architecture of these proteins, revealing elongated structures that span membrane contact sites. Functionally, BLTPs are implicated in autophagy, membrane trafficking, and organelle biogenesis, with VPS13 and ATG2 being particularly significant in these pathways. Despite advances in understanding their structure and function, several questions remain unanswered, including the precise mechanisms of lipid transfer and regulation, and the full spectrum of their physiological roles. Further research is needed to elucidate these mechanisms and to explore the potential of targeting BLTPs in therapeutic strategies for diseases linked to lipid dysregulation. This review synthesizes current knowledge and highlights future research directions."}
