{"Abstract": "The Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, has emerged as a powerful model system in cell and developmental biology, offering unique insights into evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo). This species comprises two distinct morphs: the surface-dwelling form and the blind cave-dwelling form, which have diverged in response to contrasting environmental pressures. The cavefish morph, in particular, provides a natural experiment in regressive evolution, characterized by the loss of eyes and pigmentation, alongside enhanced non-visual sensory systems. These phenotypic changes are underpinned by genetic and developmental modifications, making A. mexicanus an ideal organism for studying the genetic basis of adaptation and the mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity. Recent advances in genomic and transcriptomic technologies have facilitated the identification of key regulatory pathways and genes involved in these processes. Furthermore, the comparative analysis of surface and cave morphs offers valuable insights into the interplay between genetic drift, natural selection, and developmental constraints. This review highlights the potential of A. mexicanus to advance our understanding of evolutionary and developmental processes."}
