{"Abstract": "The Toll signaling pathway, originally characterized for its role in embryonic dorsoventral patterning in Drosophila, has undergone significant neofunctionalization across various insect lineages. This study explores the evolutionary trajectory of Toll signaling in insects, focusing on its dual roles in immunity and embryonic development. By examining model organisms such as Tribolium, Nasonia, Oncopeltus, and Gryllus, alongside non-insect hexapods, we elucidate the diversification of Toll pathway functions. Our findings highlight the pathway's involvement in germ layer evolution, particularly in mesoderm and serosa formation, and the development of serosal and blastodermal cuticles. Comparative analyses reveal how these adaptations have contributed to the evolutionary success of insects, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying embryonic patterning. This research underscores the importance of Toll signaling in the context of evolutionary developmental biology, offering a comprehensive understanding of its role in shaping insect diversity and complexity."}
