{"Abstract": "Morphogens are crucial signaling molecules that orchestrate tissue development by forming concentration gradients across developing embryos. These gradients provide positional information that influences gene regulatory networks, guiding cellular differentiation and spatial organization. The diffusion of morphogens through tissues establishes these gradients, which are interpreted by cells to activate specific genetic programs. This process is essential for the precise patterning and formation of complex structures during embryogenesis. Recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of morphogen action have revealed intricate feedback loops and cross-talk within gene regulatory networks, highlighting the dynamic nature of tissue development. This review synthesizes current knowledge on morphogen-mediated control of tissue development, emphasizing the interplay between diffusion dynamics and genetic regulation."}
