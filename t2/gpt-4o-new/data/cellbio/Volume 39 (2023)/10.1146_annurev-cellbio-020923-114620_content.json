{"Abstract": "Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) represents a paradigm shift in understanding how organisms adapt across generations. This study explores the logic and mechanisms underlying TEI, focusing on its role in facilitating adaptation over varying timescales. By examining intergenerational inheritance, we assess how epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, are transmitted across generations without altering the underlying DNA sequence. Our analysis highlights the potential of TEI to enable rapid adaptation to environmental changes, providing a complementary mechanism to genetic evolution. We discuss the conditions under which TEI is most likely to occur and its implications for evolutionary biology. Furthermore, we explore the interplay between genetic and epigenetic factors in shaping phenotypic outcomes, emphasizing the importance of considering both in evolutionary models. This research underscores the need for a comprehensive framework that integrates TEI into our understanding of adaptation, with significant implications for fields ranging from ecology to medicine."}
