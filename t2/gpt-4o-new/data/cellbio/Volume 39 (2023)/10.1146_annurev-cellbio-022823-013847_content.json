{"Abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) are pivotal in regulating gene expression, yet their dynamic behavior at the single-molecule level remains incompletely understood. This study employs advanced single-molecule tracking techniques to elucidate the real-time dynamics of TFs within live cells. By observing individual TF molecules, we uncover insights into transcriptional bursting and its implications for gene regulation. Our findings reveal that TFs exhibit a spectrum of binding affinities and residence times, influenced by chromatin dynamics and genome organization. These interactions are crucial for modulating transcriptional activity and ensuring precise gene expression. Furthermore, the study highlights the role of chromatin architecture in facilitating or hindering TF access to target sites, thereby impacting transcriptional outcomes. This research advances our understanding of the intricate mechanisms governing TF dynamics and their contribution to cellular function, offering potential avenues for therapeutic intervention in diseases linked to dysregulated gene expression."}
