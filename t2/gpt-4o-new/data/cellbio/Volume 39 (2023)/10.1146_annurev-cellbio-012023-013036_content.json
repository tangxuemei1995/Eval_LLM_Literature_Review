{"Abstract": "The development of the vertebrate retina is a complex process that involves a series of well-orchestrated morphogenetic events, from the initial formation of the optic cup to the intricate lamination of neuronal layers. This study provides a comprehensive overview of retinal morphogenesis, focusing on the dynamic changes in shape and growth that occur during the transition from the optic cup to a fully laminated retina. We explore the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive these processes, highlighting the role of key signaling pathways and transcription factors in coordinating cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Particular attention is given to the mechanisms of neuronal migration, which are crucial for the establishment of the retina's layered structure. By examining the interplay between intrinsic genetic programs and extrinsic environmental cues, we aim to elucidate how these factors contribute to the precise spatial and temporal regulation of retinal development. Our findings underscore the importance of understanding retinal morphogenesis not only for basic biological insight but also for its implications in regenerative medicine and the treatment of retinal disorders. This review synthesizes current knowledge and identifies gaps in our understanding, suggesting directions for future research to unravel the complexities of retinal development and its potential for therapeutic intervention."}
