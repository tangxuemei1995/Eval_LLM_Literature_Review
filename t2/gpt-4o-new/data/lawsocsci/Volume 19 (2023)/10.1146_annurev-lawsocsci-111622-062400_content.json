{"Abstract": "This study critically examines the intersection of race and low-wage immigrant labor, highlighting the pervasive influence of racism in shaping labor experiences and rights. By centering race in the analysis, the research reveals how racial hierarchies and discrimination exacerbate vulnerabilities among immigrant workers, often relegating them to precarious employment conditions. The study draws on a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating sociological, economic, and legal perspectives to explore the systemic barriers faced by these workers. It argues for a justice-oriented framework that acknowledges the racialized dimensions of labor exploitation and advocates for policy reforms to enhance the rights and protections of immigrant laborers. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the racial dynamics in labor markets and calls for more inclusive and equitable labor practices."}
