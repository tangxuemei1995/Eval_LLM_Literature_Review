{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of global lawmaking, intellectual property rights, and international health emergencies, emphasizing the need to transcend methodological nationalism. By examining the evolution of international agreements, the research highlights how intellectual property frameworks influence global health responses. The analysis reveals that traditional nation-centric approaches often overlook the complexities of global governance and the transnational nature of health crises. Through case studies of recent health emergencies, the study demonstrates the impact of intellectual property laws on access to essential medicines and vaccines. It argues for a more integrated approach to global lawmaking that considers diverse stakeholders and cross-border challenges. The findings underscore the importance of collaborative international efforts in crafting legal frameworks that balance innovation incentives with public health needs, ultimately contributing to more effective global health governance."}
