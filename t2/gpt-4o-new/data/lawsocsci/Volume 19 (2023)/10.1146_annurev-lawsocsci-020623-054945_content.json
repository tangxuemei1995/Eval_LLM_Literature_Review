{"Abstract": "The legacy of Guantánamo Bay remains a contentious issue in the discourse on international law and human rights. This study examines the implications of practices such as torture and the use of CIA black sites, which have raised significant ethical and legal concerns. The establishment of military commissions and their subsequent challenges in the Supreme Court highlight ongoing tensions between national security and the rule of law. The erosion of habeas corpus rights for detainees has further complicated the legal landscape, raising questions about accountability and justice in the context of alleged war crimes. By analyzing these elements, the research underscores the enduring impact of Guantánamo on global perceptions of U.S. legal standards and its commitment to human rights. The findings suggest a need for comprehensive policy reforms to address these issues and restore confidence in the rule of law."}
