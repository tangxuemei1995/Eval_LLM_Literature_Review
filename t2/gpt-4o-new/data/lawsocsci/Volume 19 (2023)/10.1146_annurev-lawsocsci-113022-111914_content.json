{"Abstract": "This study examines the dual role of police officers as both witnesses and defendants in court proceedings, highlighting the implications for police accountability and the justice system. The research delves into the complexities surrounding police testimony, particularly issues of perjury and the disclosure of Brady evidence, which mandates the sharing of exculpatory information. The analysis also explores the doctrine of qualified immunity, which often shields officers from civil liability, potentially impacting their accountability. By reviewing case law, legal standards, and empirical data, the study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these legal frameworks influence the behavior and accountability of law enforcement officers. The findings suggest that while legal protections are necessary for effective policing, they must be balanced with mechanisms that ensure transparency and accountability. This research contributes to ongoing discussions about reforming legal standards to enhance trust and integrity within the criminal justice system."}
