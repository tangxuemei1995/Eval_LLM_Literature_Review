{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of psychology and law in addressing implicit biases and promoting equitable intergroup relations. By examining the role of legal frameworks and policies as social interventions, the research investigates how these mechanisms can either perpetuate or mitigate segregation and implicit biases within social cognition. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, the study identifies key legal strategies that have successfully reduced bias and fostered inclusivity. It also highlights the psychological underpinnings of bias formation and the potential for laws to serve as debiasing tools. The findings suggest that well-crafted policies can significantly influence social attitudes and behaviors, promoting a more equitable society. This research underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in developing effective interventions to cultivate equal minds and improve intergroup dynamics."}
