{"Abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into government operations presents both opportunities and challenges, necessitating a nuanced approach to regulation and sociotechnical design. This study explores the complexities involved in regulating AI within public administration, emphasizing the need for a framework that balances innovation with ethical considerations and public accountability. By examining current regulatory practices and institutional designs, the research identifies key areas where AI can enhance governmental efficiency and transparency, while also highlighting potential risks such as bias, privacy concerns, and the erosion of public trust. The paper argues for a collaborative approach to AI governance, involving stakeholders from various sectors to ensure that AI systems are designed and implemented in a manner that aligns with democratic values and societal needs. Through a comprehensive analysis of case studies and policy frameworks, the study provides insights into effective strategies for managing the sociotechnical challenges posed by AI in government, ultimately advocating for adaptive regulatory mechanisms that can evolve alongside technological advancements."}
