{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between social reproduction and legal frameworks, emphasizing the often-overlooked roles of unpaid domestic and care work. By integrating perspectives from legal realism and materialist feminism, the research highlights how legal systems perpetuate gendered divisions of labor, reinforcing economic and social inequalities. The analysis delves into the historical and contemporary legal structures that shape and sustain the undervaluation of domestic work, arguing for a reconceptualization of law and political economy to address these disparities. Through a critical examination of legal texts and policies, the study reveals the systemic biases that marginalize unpaid labor, advocating for legal reforms that recognize and redistribute the burdens of social reproduction. This work contributes to the broader discourse on gender justice and economic equity, proposing a transformative legal approach that aligns with the realities of care and domestic work in modern societies."}
