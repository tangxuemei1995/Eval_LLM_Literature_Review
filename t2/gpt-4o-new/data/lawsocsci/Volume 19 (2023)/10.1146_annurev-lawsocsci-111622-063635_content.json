{"Abstract": "This study examines the intricate relationship between authoritarian legality and state capitalism in China, focusing on the dual state system's impact on property rights, markets, land, and labor. The research explores how China's unique blend of authoritarian governance and market-oriented reforms has shaped its legal framework, particularly in terms of rule of law and economic development. By analyzing the dual state concept, which differentiates between the formal legal system and the informal practices that often override it, the study highlights the complexities of property rights enforcement and market regulation. The findings suggest that while the Chinese state employs legal mechanisms to facilitate economic growth and maintain social stability, it simultaneously exercises discretionary power to control key resources such as land and labor. This dual approach enables the state to sustain its authoritarian rule while promoting a form of state capitalism that is distinctively Chinese, raising questions about the long-term sustainability of this model."}
