{"Abstract": "This study examines the implications of mandatory employment arbitration as a form of alternative dispute resolution in the context of employment law. With the increasing prevalence of arbitration clauses in employment contracts, this research explores how such mandates impact employees' access to justice. The analysis considers the balance between efficiency and fairness, evaluating whether arbitration provides a viable alternative to traditional litigation. By reviewing recent case studies and legal frameworks, the study highlights the potential benefits and drawbacks of mandatory arbitration, including cost-effectiveness, speed of resolution, and concerns over impartiality and power imbalances. The findings suggest that while arbitration can offer a streamlined process, it may also limit employees' legal recourse and transparency. This research contributes to the ongoing debate on the role of arbitration in employment disputes, offering insights for policymakers, legal practitioners, and stakeholders in employment relations."}
