{"Abstract": "This study explores civil litigants' evaluations of their legal experiences, focusing on their perceptions of procedural fairness, satisfaction, and overall justice within the civil law system. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, the research examines how litigants assess the fairness of legal procedures and the extent to which these evaluations influence their satisfaction with the legal process. The findings reveal that perceptions of fairness significantly impact litigants' satisfaction, with transparent and equitable procedures enhancing positive evaluations. The study underscores the importance of procedural justice in shaping litigants' experiences and suggests that reforms aimed at increasing transparency and fairness could improve satisfaction levels. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of litigants' perspectives and the broader implications for civil law practices."}
