{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of law, public health, and science through the lens of vaccines, employing an interdisciplinary approach that integrates sociolegal studies, ethnography, and science and technology studies (STS). By moving beyond the traditional view of law as merely a regulatory tool, this research examines how legal frameworks interact with social, cultural, and technological dimensions in the context of vaccination. Through ethnographic methods, the study captures the lived experiences and perceptions of various stakeholders, including policymakers, healthcare providers, and the public. It highlights the complex sociolegal landscapes that shape vaccine development, distribution, and acceptance. The findings underscore the importance of understanding vaccines not only as medical interventions but as socio-technical artifacts embedded within broader societal structures. This research contributes to a more nuanced comprehension of public health strategies, advocating for policies that are informed by interdisciplinary insights and responsive to the dynamic interplay of law, society, and technology."}
