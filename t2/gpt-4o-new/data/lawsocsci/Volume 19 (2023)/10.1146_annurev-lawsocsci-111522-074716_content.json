{"Abstract": "The integration of technology, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), into law firms is reshaping the legal profession, though the extent of this transformation varies. This study examines the impact of technological advancements on law firms, focusing on AI's role in enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and client service. While some firms have embraced these innovations, leading to significant organizational changes and improved service delivery, others remain resistant, citing concerns over cost, security, and the potential loss of traditional legal skills. The concept of organizational complementarity is explored, highlighting how technology can complement human expertise rather than replace it. The research identifies key factors influencing the adoption of technology, including firm size, client demands, and regulatory environments. Ultimately, the study concludes that while technology holds the potential to transform law firms, its success depends on strategic implementation and the willingness of legal professionals to adapt to new tools and methodologies."}
