{"Abstract": "This study explores the concept of refeudalization in the context of modern legal and political systems, examining the shift from the rule of law to a framework characterized by ties of allegiance. It investigates how contemporary governance structures increasingly reflect feudal characteristics, where personal loyalty and contractual relationships overshadow traditional democratic principles and sovereignty. The research delves into the implications of this shift for democratic representation and the contractualization of political and legal obligations. By analyzing historical precedents and current trends, the paper argues that refeudalization undermines the foundational tenets of democracy and the rule of law, leading to a fragmented sovereignty. The study provides a critical assessment of how these changes affect the balance of power and the nature of legal authority, offering insights into the potential future trajectory of governance in an era marked by increasing complexity and interdependence."}
