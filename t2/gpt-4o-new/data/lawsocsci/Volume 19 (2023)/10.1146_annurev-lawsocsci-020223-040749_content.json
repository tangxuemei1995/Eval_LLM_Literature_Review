{"Abstract": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has prompted a critical examination of their implications for global governance. This study explores the modalities and rationales underpinning AI regulation, highlighting the complex interplay between technological innovation and regulatory frameworks. By analyzing the diverse approaches to algorithmic regulation, the research identifies key tensions that arise in the pursuit of harmonized global governance structures. These tensions include the balance between innovation and control, the protection of individual rights versus collective security, and the challenges of ensuring equitable access to AI benefits across different geopolitical landscapes. The paper argues for a nuanced understanding of AI's transformative potential, advocating for collaborative international efforts to establish coherent regulatory standards. Such efforts are essential to mitigate risks while fostering an environment conducive to ethical AI development and deployment. Ultimately, this research contributes to the discourse on how global governance can adapt to the evolving landscape of AI, ensuring its alignment with broader societal goals."}
