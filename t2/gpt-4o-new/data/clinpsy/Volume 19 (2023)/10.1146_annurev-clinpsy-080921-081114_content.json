{"Abstract": "This study explores the complex interplay between supernatural attributions and the interpretation of events, focusing on beliefs in God, the Devil, demons, spirits, fate, and karma. By examining the psychological and cultural dimensions of supernatural and paranormal beliefs, the research aims to understand how individuals attribute causality to these entities in response to anomalous experiences. The study delves into the role of spiritual struggles and religious frameworks in shaping these attributions, highlighting the influence of personal and societal factors. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical analysis, the research identifies patterns in how supernatural beliefs are invoked to explain life's uncertainties and challenges. The findings suggest that such attributions can provide comfort, meaning, and a sense of control, while also potentially leading to spiritual conflicts. This work contributes to the broader understanding of the intersection between religion, spirituality, and human cognition."}
