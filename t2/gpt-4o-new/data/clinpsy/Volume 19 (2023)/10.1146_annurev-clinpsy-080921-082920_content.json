{"Abstract": "Over the past forty years, meta-analysis has become a cornerstone in evaluating the efficacy of youth psychotherapy, providing a comprehensive synthesis of research findings from numerous randomized controlled trials. This study reviews the evolution of meta-analytic techniques and their application in assessing treatment benefits for young populations. By examining effect sizes across diverse therapeutic modalities, the research highlights the consistent positive impact of evidence-based psychotherapies on youth mental health outcomes. The analysis underscores the importance of methodological rigor and the need for standardized reporting practices to enhance the reliability of meta-analytic conclusions. Furthermore, it identifies gaps in the literature, such as the underrepresentation of certain demographic groups and the need for long-term follow-up studies. The findings advocate for the continued refinement of meta-analytic methods to better inform clinical practice and policy-making, ultimately aiming to optimize therapeutic interventions for youth and advance the science of research synthesis."}
