{"Abstract": "The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act (GLSMA) represents a pivotal federal initiative aimed at reducing youth suicide rates through comprehensive prevention strategies. This review examines the implementation and impact of the GLSMA, focusing on its effectiveness in enhancing community-based suicide prevention efforts. The initiative provides grants to states, tribes, and educational institutions to develop and expand suicide prevention programs targeting young individuals. Evaluation of the GLSMA reveals significant improvements in awareness, identification, and intervention practices among stakeholders, including educators, mental health professionals, and community leaders. The analysis highlights the importance of culturally sensitive approaches and the integration of evidence-based practices in reducing suicide risk factors. Despite positive outcomes, challenges such as sustainability and resource allocation persist. This review underscores the need for continued support and adaptation of the GLSMA to address evolving mental health needs and to further decrease youth suicide rates across diverse populations."}
