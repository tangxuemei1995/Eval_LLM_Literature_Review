{"Abstract": "This study critically examines the practice of partialing, or the use of residualized variables, in refining scores and making inferences about psychological constructs. Partialing is often employed to control for confounding variables, aiming to enhance construct validity. However, this approach may inadvertently distort the true nature of the constructs being measured, leading to questionable measurement practices. By analyzing the implications of statistical control and semipartial effects, this research highlights potential pitfalls in the interpretation of residualized variables. The findings suggest that while partialing can offer insights into specific relationships, it may also obscure the broader context of psychological constructs, thus challenging the validity of inferences drawn from such analyses. The study calls for a more cautious application of partialing, advocating for alternative methods that preserve the integrity of psychological measurements and enhance the robustness of construct validity."}
