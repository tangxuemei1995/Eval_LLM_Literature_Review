{"Abstract": "Eating disorders, traditionally perceived as predominantly affecting females, are increasingly recognized in boys and men, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of their epidemiology, intervention strategies, and outcomes. This review synthesizes current research on the prevalence and characteristics of eating disorders in male populations, highlighting unique risk factors and symptomatology. Despite underdiagnosis and stigma, evidence suggests a significant prevalence of disorders such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder among males. Intervention strategies tailored to the male experience are crucial, as traditional approaches may not address specific needs. The review also examines treatment outcomes, emphasizing the importance of early detection and gender-sensitive therapeutic approaches. By addressing these gaps, the study aims to improve clinical practices and outcomes for boys and men with eating disorders, ultimately contributing to more inclusive and effective healthcare solutions."}
