{"Abstract": "Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) explores the intricate interactions between the nervous and immune systems, highlighting their impact on mental health. This field has unveiled how immune-to-brain communication can influence psychological states, particularly through pathways involving inflammation and cytokine signaling. Sickness behavior, characterized by fatigue, anhedonia, and cognitive impairment, exemplifies the behavioral manifestations of immune activation. Psychosocial stress is a critical factor that can exacerbate inflammatory responses, potentially leading to or worsening depressive symptoms. Understanding these mechanisms offers valuable insights for clinical psychology, suggesting that interventions targeting inflammation may benefit individuals with stress-related disorders. Translational science in PNI aims to bridge the gap between basic research and clinical applications, fostering the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This introduction to PNI underscores the importance of considering immune system dynamics in psychological assessments and interventions, paving the way for more comprehensive and effective mental health care approaches."}
