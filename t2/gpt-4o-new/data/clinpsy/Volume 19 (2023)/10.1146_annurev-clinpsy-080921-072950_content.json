{"Abstract": "This study explores the integration of evidence-based practices with culturally resonant approaches, termed 'alter-Native psy-ence,' in community mental health services for American Indians and Alaska Natives. Recognizing the historical and ongoing impacts of postcolonial anomie, this research highlights the necessity of Indigenized therapies that honor traditional healing practices while addressing contemporary mental health challenges. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and case studies, the study identifies key strategies for reconciling conventional evidence-based methodologies with Indigenous knowledge systems. Findings suggest that culturally tailored interventions, which incorporate community values and traditional practices, enhance therapeutic outcomes and community engagement. The research underscores the importance of collaborative partnerships between mental health professionals and Indigenous communities to foster culturally competent care. This approach not only respects the cultural heritage of American Indians and Alaska Natives but also promotes holistic well-being, offering a model for integrating diverse epistemologies in mental health services."}
