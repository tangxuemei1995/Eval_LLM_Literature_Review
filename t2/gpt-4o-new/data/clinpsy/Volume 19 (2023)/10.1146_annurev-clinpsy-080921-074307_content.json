{"Abstract": "Tic disorders, including Tourette disorder, present significant challenges for affected individuals, impacting social, academic, and occupational functioning. This study reviews the efficacy of behavioral interventions, particularly focusing on habit reversal training (HRT) and comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics (CBIT), in managing tic symptoms in both children and adults. These interventions emphasize awareness training, competing response training, and functional intervention strategies. Additionally, the role of exposure and response prevention (ERP) is explored as a complementary approach. Evidence suggests that these non-pharmacological treatments can lead to substantial reductions in tic severity and improve quality of life. The review highlights the importance of individualized treatment plans and the potential for integrating behavioral therapies with pharmacological treatments to optimize outcomes for individuals with tic disorders."}
