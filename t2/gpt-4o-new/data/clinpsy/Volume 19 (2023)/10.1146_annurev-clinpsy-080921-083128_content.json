{"Abstract": "Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and Experience Sampling Method (ESM) are pivotal in capturing real-time data on individuals' behaviors and experiences. This study critically evaluates pressing issues within EMA, focusing on content validity, reliability, and the establishment of gold standards. The research highlights the challenges of training participants and researchers to ensure accurate data collection and interpretation. Missingness, a common issue in EMA, is examined, with strategies proposed to mitigate its impact on data integrity. The study also addresses selection bias, emphasizing the need for representative sampling to enhance the generalizability of findings. Furthermore, the research explores the development of robust comparison standards to evaluate EMA data against traditional assessment methods. By synthesizing current literature and empirical findings, this study provides a comprehensive overview of the methodological challenges in EMA and offers practical recommendations for researchers. The findings aim to enhance the reliability and validity of EMA, ensuring its continued utility in psychological and behavioral research."}
