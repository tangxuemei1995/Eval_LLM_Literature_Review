{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between racism and the social determinants of psychosis, emphasizing the impact of racial discrimination on the prevalence and severity of psychotic experiences. By examining neighborhood factors and structural racism, the research highlights how these elements contribute to the onset and progression of early psychosis. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, the study synthesizes findings from epidemiology, sociology, and psychology to elucidate the pathways through which racism exacerbates mental health disparities. The analysis reveals that individuals from racially marginalized communities are disproportionately affected by adverse social determinants, such as poverty, limited access to healthcare, and exposure to violence, which collectively heighten the risk of developing psychosis. Furthermore, the study underscores the necessity of addressing structural racism to mitigate these risks and improve mental health outcomes. The findings advocate for policy interventions and community-based strategies aimed at reducing racial discrimination and promoting equitable access to resources, ultimately fostering resilience against psychotic disorders."}
