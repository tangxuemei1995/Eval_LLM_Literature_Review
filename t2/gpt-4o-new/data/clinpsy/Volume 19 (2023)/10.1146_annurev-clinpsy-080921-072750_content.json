{"Abstract": "Culturally Responsive Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is increasingly recognized as a vital approach to addressing mental health disparities among ethnically diverse populations. This study explores the integration of cultural competence into CBT, emphasizing the need for clinician training in cultural adaptation to enhance therapeutic outcomes. By examining existing literature and case studies, the research identifies key strategies for adapting CBT to align with the cultural values, beliefs, and practices of minority groups. The findings suggest that culturally tailored CBT can significantly improve engagement and effectiveness in minority mental health care. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of ongoing education and training for clinicians to develop cultural sensitivity and awareness, thereby fostering a more inclusive therapeutic environment. This research underscores the potential of culturally responsive CBT to bridge the gap in mental health services for ethnically diverse populations, ultimately contributing to the reduction of mental health disparities and promoting equitable access to care."}
