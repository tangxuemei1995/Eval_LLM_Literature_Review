{"Abstract": "This study explores the developmental consequences of intimate partner violence (IPV) on children, emphasizing the multifaceted impact on their psychological and emotional growth. IPV, a pervasive form of domestic violence, often results in prenatal stress and disrupted attachment patterns, which are critical to child development. The research synthesizes findings from recent literature, highlighting how exposure to IPV can lead to adverse outcomes such as anxiety, depression, and behavioral issues in children. Furthermore, the study examines the role of prenatal stress in altering neurodevelopmental trajectories, potentially leading to long-term cognitive and emotional challenges. The analysis underscores the importance of early intervention and supportive measures to mitigate these effects, advocating for integrated approaches that address both the immediate and enduring impacts of IPV on children. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between IPV and child development, informing policy and practice aimed at fostering resilience and recovery."}
