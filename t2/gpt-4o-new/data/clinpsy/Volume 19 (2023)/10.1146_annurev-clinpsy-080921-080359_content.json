{"Abstract": "This review explores the prevalence, mechanisms, and treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among refugees, a population disproportionately affected by trauma. Refugees often experience a range of traumatic events, including war, persecution, and displacement, which significantly increase their risk of developing PTSD. The review synthesizes current literature on the unique psychological and physiological mechanisms underlying PTSD in refugees, highlighting the role of cultural, social, and environmental factors. It also examines the effectiveness of various treatment modalities, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, narrative exposure therapy, and culturally adapted interventions, in addressing PTSD symptoms in this population. Furthermore, the review discusses the challenges in diagnosing and treating PTSD in refugees, such as language barriers and limited access to mental health services. By identifying gaps in current research and practice, this review aims to inform future studies and improve mental health outcomes for refugees suffering from PTSD. The findings underscore the need for tailored, accessible, and culturally sensitive mental health care for refugees."}
