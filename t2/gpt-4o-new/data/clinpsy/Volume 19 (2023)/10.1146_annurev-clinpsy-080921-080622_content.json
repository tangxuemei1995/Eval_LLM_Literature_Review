{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate relationship between acculturation processes and the development of psychopathology among immigrant and refugee populations. By distinguishing between proximal acculturation, which occurs through direct cultural contact, and remote acculturation, influenced by globalization, the research examines their respective impacts on mental health. Utilizing a developmental psychopathology framework, the study investigates how these acculturation processes contribute to or mitigate psychological distress and disorders. The role of resilience as a protective factor is also analyzed, highlighting its potential to buffer against adverse mental health outcomes. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical data, the study aims to provide insights into the complex dynamics of cultural adaptation and mental health, offering implications for interventions and support systems tailored to diverse cultural contexts in an increasingly globalized world."}
