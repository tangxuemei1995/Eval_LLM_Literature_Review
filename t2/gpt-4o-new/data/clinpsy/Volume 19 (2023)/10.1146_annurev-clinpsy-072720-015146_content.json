{"Abstract": "This study explores the resilience factors that contribute to the mental health of African American youth, focusing on the interplay of racial identity, ethnic-racial socialization, religiosity, spirituality, and family dynamics. Amidst the challenges posed by systemic racism, these factors serve as protective mechanisms that bolster psychological well-being. The research highlights how strong racial identity and positive ethnic-racial socialization practices enhance self-esteem and coping strategies. Additionally, the roles of religiosity and spirituality are examined as sources of comfort and community support. Family and parenting practices are identified as crucial in fostering resilience, providing emotional stability and guidance. This comprehensive analysis underscores the importance of culturally informed interventions to support the mental health of African American youth, promoting resilience in the face of adversity."}
