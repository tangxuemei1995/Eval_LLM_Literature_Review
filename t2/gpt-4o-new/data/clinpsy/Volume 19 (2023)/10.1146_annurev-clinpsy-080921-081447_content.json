{"Abstract": "This review critically examines the risk and resilience factors affecting children with incarcerated parents, emphasizing the need for a nuanced understanding through an intersectional lens. The study synthesizes existing literature to highlight the complex interplay of socio-economic, racial, and familial dynamics that contribute to the vulnerabilities and strengths of these children. It challenges traditional deficit-focused narratives by reframing resilience as a dynamic process influenced by systemic inequalities and social justice issues. The review identifies key intervention strategies that promote resilience, advocating for policies and practices that address structural barriers and support family cohesion. By integrating intersectionality, the research underscores the importance of tailored interventions that consider the diverse experiences of these children. The findings call for a shift towards holistic approaches that empower children and their families, fostering environments where resilience can thrive despite the challenges posed by parental incarceration."}
