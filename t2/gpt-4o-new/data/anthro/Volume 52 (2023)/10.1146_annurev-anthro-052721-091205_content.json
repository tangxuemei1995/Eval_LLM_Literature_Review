{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate dynamics between social movements, power structures, and mediated visibility in the digital age. By examining the role of visual media, the research highlights how social movements leverage platforms to challenge state and corporate power. It investigates the strategies employed by movements to gain visibility and the countermeasures by states and corporations to control narratives. The analysis reveals a complex interplay where technology acts as both an enabler and a barrier to social change. The findings underscore the importance of understanding mediated visibility as a critical factor in the efficacy and sustainability of contemporary social movements."}
