{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate entanglements of security regimes within the frameworks of empire, race, and gender, employing a political anthropology lens. By examining the transnational dimensions of security, the research highlights how imperial legacies continue to shape contemporary security practices and discourses. The analysis foregrounds the role of race and gender in constructing and perpetuating these regimes, revealing how they intersect to produce differential impacts across global contexts. Through the lens of transnational feminism, the study critiques the dominant narratives of security that often marginalize or silence diverse voices and experiences. By integrating theoretical insights from political anthropology and feminist scholarship, the research offers a nuanced understanding of how security is negotiated and contested across borders. This work contributes to the broader discourse on global security by challenging traditional paradigms and advocating for more inclusive and equitable approaches to understanding and addressing security concerns."}
