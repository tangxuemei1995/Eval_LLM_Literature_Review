{"Abstract": "This study delves into the ongoing debate surrounding the Pirah達 language, an indigenous language of the Amazon, and its implications for theories of linguistic universality and cognitive processes. The Pirah達 language, noted for its apparent lack of recursion, challenges the notion of universal grammar as proposed by Chomskyan linguistics. Through a comprehensive analysis of linguistic data and fieldwork, this research examines the unique structural features of Pirah達 and their impact on the broader understanding of language faculties. By juxtaposing Pirah達 with other Amazonian languages, the study highlights the rich linguistic diversity that exists and questions the extent to which cognitive universals can be applied across different linguistic contexts. The findings suggest that while certain cognitive processes may be universal, linguistic diversity plays a crucial role in shaping language structure and use, thereby offering new insights into the interplay between language, culture, and cognition."}
