{"Abstract": "This study critically examines the paradigms underpinning global health interventions, focusing on the roles of military involvement, the pursuit of 'magic bullet' solutions, and deterministic models. By analyzing these frameworks, the research highlights the complexities and limitations inherent in current global public health strategies. The paper draws on anthropological perspectives to explore how historical and colonial legacies shape contemporary health care and aid practices. It argues for a more nuanced understanding of intervention strategies that transcend simplistic, one-size-fits-all approaches. Through case studies and theoretical analysis, the research advocates for interventions that are context-sensitive and culturally informed, emphasizing the importance of local knowledge and participatory approaches. This work contributes to the discourse on global medicine by challenging dominant narratives and proposing alternative models that prioritize equity and sustainability in health care delivery. The findings underscore the need for a paradigm shift towards more holistic and inclusive global health practices."}
