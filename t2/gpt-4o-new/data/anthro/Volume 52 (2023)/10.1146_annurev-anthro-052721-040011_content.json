{"Abstract": "Critical University Studies (CUS) is an emerging interdisciplinary field that interrogates the structures, practices, and ideologies underpinning higher education. This research explores the intersections of decolonization, abolition, and Black studies within the context of CUS, aiming to dismantle oppressive systems and reimagine the university as a site of liberation. By critically examining the historical and contemporary roles of universities in perpetuating colonial and racial hierarchies, this study advocates for transformative approaches that prioritize equity and justice. The integration of decolonial and abolitionist frameworks challenges traditional academic paradigms, fostering inclusive and diverse educational environments. This paper contributes to the growing body of CUS literature by highlighting the potential of Black studies to inform and inspire radical change in higher education. Ultimately, this research calls for a re-envisioning of the university as a space that not only reflects but actively contributes to social transformation and the dismantling of systemic inequities."}
