{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of algorithms and ecology, examining how algorithms function as infrastructural elements within social imaginaries and smart technologies. By conceptualizing algorithms as ecological entities, the research highlights their role in shaping interfaces and mediating human-technology interactions. The paper argues for a reconceptualization of algorithms beyond mere computational tools, proposing a framework that considers their ecological impacts and interdependencies. Through a multidisciplinary approach, the study investigates the socio-technical dynamics that emerge from algorithmic infrastructures, emphasizing the need for sustainable and ethical algorithmic practices. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between technology, society, and the environment."}
