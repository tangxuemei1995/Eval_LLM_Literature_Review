{"Abstract": "This study revisits the anthropology of masculinity, focusing on the evolving dynamics of gender and sexuality in contemporary societies. By examining the often unmarked category of men, this research highlights the complexities and diversities within masculinities, challenging traditional notions and stereotypes. The analysis draws on ethnographic data and theoretical frameworks to explore how men navigate and negotiate their identities amidst changing social norms and expectations. It addresses the intersections of masculinity with issues of inequality, power, and privilege, emphasizing the role of cultural, economic, and political factors in shaping male experiences. The study also considers the impact of global movements advocating for gender equality and how these influence perceptions and practices of masculinity. Ultimately, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of gender dynamics, advocating for a more nuanced and inclusive approach to studying men and masculinity in anthropology."}
