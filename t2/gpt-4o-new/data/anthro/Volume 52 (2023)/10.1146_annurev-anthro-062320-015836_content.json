{"Abstract": "This study explores the dynamic interplay between feminist practice and digital archaeology in shaping the understanding of European prehistory, particularly during the Neolithic era. By examining the autobiographical narratives of archaeologists, the research highlights how personal and professional shifts influence the construction of historical narratives. The integration of middle range research methodologies provides a framework for analyzing the impact of these shifting standpoints on the interpretation of archaeological data. Through a critical review of the history of archaeology, the paper acknowledges the inspirations and challenges that have driven the evolution of archaeological practices. The findings underscore the importance of reflexivity and adaptability in archaeological research, advocating for a more inclusive and nuanced approach to reconstructing the past. This work contributes to the ongoing discourse on the role of personal and collective experiences in shaping archaeological interpretations, emphasizing the need for a diverse and interdisciplinary perspective in the field."}
