{"Abstract": "This study explores the transformative potential of decolonizing museums, emphasizing a paradigm shift towards more inclusive and equitable practices. By integrating Native American scholarship and indigenization strategies, museums can challenge traditional narratives and power structures that have historically marginalized Indigenous voices. The research examines case studies where museums have successfully implemented decolonization initiatives, highlighting the role of collaboration with Indigenous communities in reshaping curatorial practices and exhibition narratives. It also addresses the challenges and resistance faced in this process, advocating for a sustained commitment to ethical stewardship and cultural sensitivity. The findings suggest that decolonizing museums not only enriches the cultural landscape but also fosters a deeper understanding and respect for Indigenous histories and contributions. This paradigm shift is essential for museums to remain relevant and responsive to the diverse communities they serve, ultimately contributing to a more just and inclusive society."}
