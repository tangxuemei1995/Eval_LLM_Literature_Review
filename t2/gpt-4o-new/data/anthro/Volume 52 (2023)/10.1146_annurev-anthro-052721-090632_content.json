{"Abstract": "Biological normalcy is a concept that explores the intersection of human biology and cultural norms, challenging traditional notions of what is considered 'normal' in human populations. This research examines how normative views are constructed and perpetuated through statistical measures, often overlooking the inherent biological variation among individuals. By analyzing the interplay between cultural expectations and biological diversity, the study highlights the limitations of using statistical averages to define normalcy. It argues for a more nuanced understanding that recognizes the spectrum of human biological variation as a natural and essential aspect of human diversity. The findings suggest that redefining normalcy in human biology requires a shift from rigid statistical norms to a more inclusive framework that accommodates cultural and biological diversity. This approach not only enhances our understanding of human biology but also promotes a more equitable view of human health and well-being."}
