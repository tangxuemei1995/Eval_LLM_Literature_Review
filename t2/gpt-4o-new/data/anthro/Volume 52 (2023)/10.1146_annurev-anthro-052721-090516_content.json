{"Abstract": "The interplay between environmental factors and epigenetic mechanisms is increasingly recognized as a pivotal determinant in the pace of human aging. This review explores how external influences, such as diet, pollution, and lifestyle, modulate epigenetic marks, thereby impacting biological age and susceptibility to age-related diseases. Central to this discussion is the concept of the 'epigenetic clock,' a biomarker of aging that reflects cumulative epigenetic changes over time. By examining recent advances in epigenetic research, we highlight how environmental exposures can accelerate or decelerate the epigenetic clock, influencing the onset of conditions like cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegeneration. Understanding these dynamics offers potential for interventions aimed at modulating epigenetic states to promote healthy aging. This synthesis underscores the need for integrative approaches combining environmental science, epigenetics, and gerontology to unravel the complexities of aging and develop strategies to enhance longevity and quality of life."}
