{"Abstract": "This study explores the burgeoning field of research on long-distance connections across the ancient Indian Ocean, with a focus on South Asia's role in these maritime networks. Recent archaeological findings have significantly advanced our understanding of the complex trade systems that facilitated the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultures across this vast region. Key artifacts such as beads and ceramics serve as tangible evidence of these interactions, revealing intricate trade routes and cultural exchanges between South Asia and distant lands. The analysis of these materials, alongside emerging technologies in archaeological science, has provided new insights into the socio-economic and cultural dynamics of ancient Indian Ocean societies. This paper synthesizes recent developments in the field, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in uncovering the historical significance of these maritime networks and their impact on the civilizations connected by the Indian Ocean."}
