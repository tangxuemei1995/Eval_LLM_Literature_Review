{"Abstract": "Water insecurity is an increasingly pressing issue that intersects with human biology, affecting hydration, thirst, and overall health. This study explores the physiological and psychological dimensions of water needs and the embodiment of water scarcity. It examines how individuals and communities adapt through various coping strategies in response to limited water access. The research highlights the biological imperatives of hydration and the consequences of chronic water insecurity on human health, including impacts on metabolic processes and cognitive function. Furthermore, the study considers the exacerbating effects of climate change on water availability, emphasizing the need for sustainable water management practices. By integrating insights from human biology and environmental science, this research underscores the critical importance of addressing water insecurity to safeguard human health and well-being. The findings aim to inform policy and community-level interventions that enhance resilience against the backdrop of a changing climate."}
