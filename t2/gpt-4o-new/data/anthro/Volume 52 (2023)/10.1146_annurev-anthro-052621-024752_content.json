{"Abstract": "This study revisits the perception of Neandertals within the history of science, challenging long-standing narratives shaped by race and racism. Traditionally depicted as primitive and inferior to Homo sapiens, Neandertals have often been marginalized in anthropological discourse. Recent findings, however, suggest a more complex picture, highlighting their capacity for symbolic behavior, such as art and ritual, which blurs the lines between them and modern humans. This research explores how these revelations disrupt the 'uncanny valley' effect, where Neandertals are perceived as eerily similar yet distinct from Homo sapiens, evoking discomfort and bias. By examining the evolution of scientific perspectives and the influence of racial ideologies, this paper argues for a re-evaluation of Neandertals' place in human history. It calls for a more nuanced understanding that acknowledges their contributions to the human story, ultimately fostering a more inclusive narrative that transcends outdated racial constructs."}
