{"Abstract": "This study explores the often-overlooked labor of interpreters within the frameworks of global capitalism and humanitarian regimes. Interpreters play a crucial role in facilitating communication across linguistic and cultural barriers, yet their contributions frequently remain invisible. This invisibility is compounded by the ethical dilemmas they face, as they navigate the complexities of voice and representation. By examining the intersection of interpreters' work with the demands of global capitalism, this research highlights the ethical challenges and pressures that arise in contexts where efficiency and profit are prioritized over human connection. Furthermore, the study delves into the moral responsibilities of interpreters, who must balance fidelity to the source language with the need to convey meaning accurately and empathetically. Through a critical analysis of these dynamics, the research underscores the necessity of recognizing and valuing the essential, yet often hidden, labor of interpreters."}
