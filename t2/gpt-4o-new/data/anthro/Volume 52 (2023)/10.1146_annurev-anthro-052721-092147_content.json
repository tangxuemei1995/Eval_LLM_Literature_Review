{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of linguistic anthropology and visual semiotics, focusing on the entextualization and performativity of images. By examining how images function as communicative acts within cultural contexts, the research highlights the processes of enregisterment that imbue images with social meaning. Utilizing a semiotic framework, the study investigates how images are not merely passive representations but active participants in the construction of social realities. Through case studies, the research demonstrates how images are entextualized, gaining new meanings as they circulate across different contexts and audiences. The performative aspect of images is analyzed, revealing how they can enact social roles and identities. This interdisciplinary approach provides new insights into the dynamic relationship between language, culture, and visual media, offering a comprehensive understanding of how images contribute to the semiotic landscape of human communication."}
