{"Abstract": "This study explores the multifaceted adaptations of human bodies in extreme environments, focusing on metabolic and thermoregulatory mechanisms. As climate change intensifies, understanding these adaptations becomes crucial for predicting human resilience and vulnerability. The research examines physiological responses to extreme temperatures, high altitudes, and other challenging conditions, highlighting the role of genetic and epigenetic factors in adaptation. Additionally, the study addresses how structural inequalities exacerbate the impacts of extreme environments on marginalized populations, influencing access to resources and adaptive capacity. By integrating insights from anthropology, physiology, and environmental science, this research aims to inform strategies for enhancing human adaptability and mitigating the adverse effects of climate change, while emphasizing the need for equitable solutions to protect vulnerable communities."}
