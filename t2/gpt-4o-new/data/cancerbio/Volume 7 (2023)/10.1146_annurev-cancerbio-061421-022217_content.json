{"Abstract": "FLASH radiotherapy, characterized by ultrahigh dose rates, represents a paradigm shift in radiobiology, offering potential advantages over conventional radiotherapy. This innovative approach has demonstrated the ability to spare normal tissues while maintaining isoefficient tumor killing, challenging traditional radiobiological models. The underlying mechanisms of FLASH radiotherapy, including differential oxygen consumption and unique DNA damage responses, are under intense investigation. This review synthesizes current findings, highlighting the potential of FLASH to revolutionize cancer treatment by reducing side effects and improving patient outcomes. Future research directions are proposed to optimize clinical protocols and understand the molecular basis of FLASH effects, aiming to integrate this promising modality into standard oncological practice."}
