{"Abstract": "Cold tumors, characterized by low immune cell infiltration, present a significant challenge to effective immunotherapy. This study explores strategies to modify the tumor microenvironment, enhancing the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. By integrating approaches such as cytokine therapy, oncolytic viruses, and targeted radiation, we aim to convert cold tumors into hot, immunologically active ones. Recent clinical trials demonstrate promising results, indicating improved patient responses and survival rates. Our findings underscore the potential of these strategies to revolutionize cancer treatment, offering new hope for patients with previously unresponsive tumors."}
