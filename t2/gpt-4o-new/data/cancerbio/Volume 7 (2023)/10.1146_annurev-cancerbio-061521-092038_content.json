{"Abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into computational pathology is revolutionizing cancer diagnostics by enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of histopathological evaluations. This study explores the application of machine learning and deep learning algorithms in oncology, focusing on their role in identifying tumor characteristics and biomarkers from histopathological images. AI-driven models have demonstrated significant potential in improving diagnostic workflows by automating routine tasks, reducing human error, and providing quantitative insights that are often beyond human capability. These advancements not only streamline the diagnostic process but also contribute to personalized treatment strategies by identifying specific tumor subtypes and predicting patient outcomes. The research highlights the transformative impact of AI in clinical settings, emphasizing its potential to improve clinical outcomes through more precise and timely diagnoses. Future directions include the integration of AI with multi-omics data to further enhance the predictive power and clinical utility of computational pathology in cancer care."}
