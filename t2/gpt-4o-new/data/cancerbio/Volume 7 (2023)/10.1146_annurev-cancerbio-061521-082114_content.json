{"Abstract": "The advent of immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, with adoptive cellular therapy (ACT) emerging as a promising approach. This study explores the potential of targeting driver oncogenes and public neoantigens using T cell receptor (TCR)-based cellular therapy. Driver oncogenes, which are critical for tumor growth and survival, present unique targets for TCR-based interventions. Public neoantigens, shared across different patients, offer an opportunity for broad-spectrum therapeutic strategies. We discuss the identification and validation of TCRs specific to these targets, emphasizing the importance of high-affinity interactions for effective tumor eradication. The integration of advanced genomic and proteomic technologies facilitates the discovery of these neoantigens, enhancing the precision of TCR-based therapies. Preliminary clinical trials demonstrate promising outcomes, with significant tumor regression and minimal off-target effects. This research underscores the potential of TCR-based ACT in providing personalized and effective cancer treatments, paving the way for future innovations in oncological immunotherapy."}
