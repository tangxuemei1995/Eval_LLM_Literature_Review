{"Abstract": "Recent advances in cancer biology have highlighted the significance of phase-separated condensates in the pathogenesis of fusion oncoprotein-driven cancers. These biomolecular condensates, formed through liquid-liquid phase separation, play a crucial role in modulating transcriptional and signaling pathways. Intrinsically disordered regions and specific sequence features of fusion oncoproteins facilitate the formation of these condensates, which can aberrantly recruit transcriptional machinery and kinases, leading to dysregulated gene expression and oncogenic signaling. This review synthesizes current findings on the molecular mechanisms by which phase-separated condensates contribute to cancer progression, emphasizing the interplay between condensate dynamics and cellular signaling networks. Understanding these processes offers novel insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting the unique properties of biomolecular condensates in cancer. Future research directions include elucidating the precise sequence determinants and structural characteristics that govern condensate formation and function in oncogenesis."}
