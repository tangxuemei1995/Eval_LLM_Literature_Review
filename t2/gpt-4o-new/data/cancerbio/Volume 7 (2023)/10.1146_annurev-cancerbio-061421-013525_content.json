{"Abstract": "The development of next-generation estrogen receptor (ER)-targeted therapeutics represents a promising frontier in breast cancer treatment. This review explores the advancements in selective ER modulators (SERMs) and selective ER degraders (SERDs), which are designed to overcome resistance mechanisms associated with traditional endocrine therapies. SERMs, such as tamoxifen, have been pivotal in modulating ER activity, while SERDs offer a novel approach by promoting ER degradation, thereby reducing receptor-mediated signaling. Recent innovations in these therapeutic classes aim to enhance efficacy and minimize adverse effects, addressing the limitations of current treatments. Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate the potential of these agents to improve outcomes in ER-positive breast cancer patients, particularly those with metastatic disease. This paper highlights the molecular mechanisms, clinical progress, and future directions of ER-targeted therapies, underscoring their critical role in personalized cancer treatment strategies."}
