{"Abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) natural killer (NK) cells represent a promising frontier in cancer immunotherapy, offering a novel approach to cell therapy. Unlike CAR T cells, CAR NK cells provide an 'off-the-shelf' product, potentially overcoming limitations such as manufacturing complexity and patient-specific customization. NK cells possess innate cytotoxic abilities, which, when enhanced with CAR technology, can target and eliminate cancer cells more effectively. Recent advancements in genetic engineering have enabled the development of CAR NK cells with improved persistence, specificity, and safety profiles. This review explores the current state of CAR NK cell research, highlighting their potential to revolutionize cancer treatment and discussing the challenges that remain in translating these therapies from bench to bedside."}
