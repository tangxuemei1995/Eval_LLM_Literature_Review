{"Abstract": "The exploration of combination therapies in cancer treatment has gained momentum, driven by the need to enhance therapeutic efficacy and overcome resistance. This study examines the rationales behind combining therapies, focusing on independent action, response correlation, collateral sensitivity, and synergy. Independent action assumes that each drug contributes additively to the therapeutic effect, while response correlation considers the interdependence of drug responses. Collateral sensitivity exploits vulnerabilities in cancer cells that arise from resistance to one drug, potentially enhancing the efficacy of another. Synergy, the most sought-after outcome, occurs when combined therapies produce a greater effect than the sum of their individual effects. The role of PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors in combination therapies is highlighted, given their success in clinical trials. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for designing effective combination regimens, optimizing clinical trial outcomes, and ultimately improving patient survival rates. This research underscores the importance of strategic therapeutic combinations in advancing cancer treatment."}
