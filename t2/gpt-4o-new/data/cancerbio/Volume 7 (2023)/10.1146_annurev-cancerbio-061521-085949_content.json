{"Abstract": "The tumor microenvironment is a complex network where mononuclear phagocytes, including macrophages and dendritic cells, play pivotal roles in cancer progression and immune modulation. This review explores the biology of these cells, highlighting their dual roles in promoting and inhibiting tumor growth. Macrophages, often polarized into tumor-associated macrophages, can support tumorigenesis through immunosuppression and angiogenesis, while dendritic cells are crucial for antigen presentation and initiating anti-tumor immunity. Recent advances in therapeutic strategies aim to reprogram these cells to enhance anti-cancer responses. Approaches such as targeting macrophage polarization, enhancing dendritic cell function, and modulating their interactions within the tumor microenvironment are discussed. Understanding the intricate biology of these cells and their potential for therapeutic modulation offers promising avenues for innovative cancer treatments, aiming to shift the balance towards effective immune-mediated tumor eradication."}
