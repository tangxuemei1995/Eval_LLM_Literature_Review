{"Abstract": "Clonal heterogeneity within tumors presents a significant challenge to effective cancer immunosurveillance and immunotherapy. This study explores the impact of intratumor heterogeneity on the immune system's ability to detect and eliminate cancer cells. By analyzing diverse clonal populations within tumors, we demonstrate that heterogeneity can lead to immune evasion, as different clones may express varying levels of neoantigens and immune checkpoint molecules. Our findings suggest that clonal diversity can undermine the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, a cornerstone of modern immunotherapy. We propose that strategies to address clonal heterogeneity, such as combination therapies targeting multiple clones or enhancing neoantigen presentation, could improve patient outcomes. This research underscores the need for personalized approaches in cancer treatment, considering the unique clonal architecture of each tumor."}
