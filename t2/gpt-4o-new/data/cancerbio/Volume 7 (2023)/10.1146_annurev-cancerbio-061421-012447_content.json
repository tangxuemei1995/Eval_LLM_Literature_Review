{"Abstract": "Recent advances in genomic technologies have unveiled the prevalence of somatic mutations in normal tissues, offering novel insights into early carcinogenesis. This study explores the accumulation of mutations in stem cells as a function of aging and exposure to environmental carcinogens. By analyzing mutation patterns across various tissue types, we identify key mutational signatures that precede malignant transformation. Our findings suggest that the mutational burden in normal tissues increases with age, potentially serving as a reservoir for oncogenic mutations. Furthermore, the role of stem cells in maintaining tissue homeostasis is highlighted, as they are both targets and propagators of these mutations. Understanding the dynamics of somatic mutations in normal tissues could revolutionize cancer prevention strategies, emphasizing early detection and intervention. This research underscores the importance of integrating genomic surveillance in routine health assessments to mitigate the risk of cancer development, thereby enhancing public health outcomes."}
