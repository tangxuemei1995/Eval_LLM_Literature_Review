{"Abstract": "The intricate interplay between immune cell metabolism and tumor microenvironment dynamics is pivotal in shaping the immune response against cancer. Recent advances in immuno-oncology have highlighted the significance of immunometabolism as a critical determinant of immune cell function and efficacy in tumor eradication. This review explores the metabolic pathways that govern immune cell activity, focusing on how these pathways are altered within the tumor microenvironment. Key metabolic processes, such as glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and amino acid metabolism, are examined for their roles in modulating immune cell phenotypes and functions. Furthermore, the potential of targeting metabolic pathways to enhance anti-tumor immunity is discussed, with an emphasis on novel therapeutic strategies that aim to reprogram immune cell metabolism. By understanding the metabolic demands and adaptations of immune cells in cancer, we can develop more effective immunotherapeutic approaches. This research underscores the importance of integrating metabolic insights into the design of next-generation cancer immunotherapies, offering promising avenues for improving patient outcomes in oncology."}
