{"Abstract": "Lineage tracing has emerged as a pivotal technique in cancer biology, offering insights into tumor evolution and metastasis. Recent advancements in single-cell analysis and cell barcoding have revolutionized our ability to track cancer cell lineages in vivo with unprecedented resolution. This review highlights the latest tools and methodologies developed for lineage tracing in cancer research. We discuss the integration of CRISPR-based barcoding systems and high-throughput sequencing technologies, which enable the reconstruction of clonal dynamics and the identification of rare metastatic events. Furthermore, we explore the implications of these technologies in understanding tumor heterogeneity and the evolutionary trajectories of cancer cells. By providing a comprehensive overview of current innovations, this paper underscores the potential of lineage tracing to unravel the complexities of cancer progression and to inform the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. These tools promise to enhance our understanding of cancer biology and improve patient outcomes."}
