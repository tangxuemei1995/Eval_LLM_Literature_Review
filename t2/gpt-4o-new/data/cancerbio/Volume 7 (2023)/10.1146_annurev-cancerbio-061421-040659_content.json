{"Abstract": "The development of organoid models that accurately recapitulate the tumor immune microenvironment is crucial for advancing cancer research and personalized medicine. This study explores the engineering of immune microenvironments within tumor organoids, focusing on the integration of patient-derived organoids with immune cells in coculture systems. By incorporating immune components such as T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells into these organoids, we aim to mimic the complex interactions present in the tumor microenvironment. Our approach leverages advanced coculture techniques to maintain the viability and functionality of both tumor and immune cells, providing a more physiologically relevant model for studying tumor-immune interactions. Preliminary results demonstrate that coculture organoids exhibit enhanced immune cell infiltration and activation, offering insights into immune evasion mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. This innovative model holds promise for high-throughput drug screening and the development of immunotherapies tailored to individual patient profiles, ultimately contributing to more effective cancer treatment strategies."}
