{"Abstract": "Cellular senescence, a state of stable cell cycle arrest, plays a dual role in cancer biology, acting as both a tumor suppressor and a promoter of tumor progression. This paradoxical nature is largely mediated by the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which can enhance immune surveillance to eliminate senescent cells but also create a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment. Therapy-induced senescence (TIS) is a promising strategy to halt cancer cell proliferation, yet the persistence of senescent cells can lead to adverse effects. The emerging 'one-two punch' therapy aims to first induce senescence in cancer cells and subsequently eliminate them using senolytic agents, thereby mitigating the negative consequences of SASP. This review explores the complex biology of senescence in cancer, highlighting the potential of targeting senescent cells to improve therapeutic outcomes and the challenges that remain in harnessing this approach effectively."}
