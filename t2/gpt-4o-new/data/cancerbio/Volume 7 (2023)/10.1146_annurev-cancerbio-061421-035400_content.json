{"Abstract": "Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal malignancies, characterized by a dense stromal environment that significantly contributes to its aggressive nature and resistance to therapy. Central to this stromal architecture are cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which play a pivotal role in the tumor microenvironment (TME) by promoting desmoplasia, a hallmark of pancreatic cancer. This review synthesizes current insights into the multifaceted roles of CAFs in pancreatic cancer, highlighting their contribution to tumor heterogeneity and progression. CAFs interact with cancer cells and other stromal components, modulating the extracellular matrix and influencing immune cell infiltration, thereby creating a supportive niche for tumor growth and metastasis. Recent studies have elucidated the heterogeneity within CAF populations, revealing distinct subtypes with diverse functions, ranging from tumor-promoting to tumor-restraining activities. Understanding the dynamic interactions between CAFs and pancreatic cancer cells offers potential therapeutic avenues, such as targeting specific CAF subtypes or disrupting their signaling pathways to enhance treatment efficacy. This review underscores the necessity of integrating CAF biology into the broader context of pancreatic cancer research, aiming to develop novel strategies that can effectively modulate the TME and improve patient outcomes. Future research directions include the identification of biomarkers for CAF subtypes and the development of CAF-targeted therapies."}
