{"Abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) presents a formidable challenge in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) tumors, significantly impacting the development and efficacy of experimental cancer therapeutics. This review explores the intricate structure and function of the BBB, emphasizing its role in limiting drug delivery to CNS tumors. We discuss recent advances in understanding the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of therapeutic agents designed to penetrate the BBB, highlighting innovative strategies such as nanoparticle carriers, focused ultrasound, and receptor-mediated transport. Furthermore, we examine the implications of BBB permeability on therapeutic outcomes and the potential for personalized medicine approaches to enhance treatment efficacy. By integrating insights from recent preclinical and clinical studies, this paper underscores the necessity of overcoming BBB-related obstacles to improve the prognosis for patients with CNS malignancies. Future research directions are proposed to optimize drug delivery systems and enhance the therapeutic index of anticancer agents targeting brain tumors."}
