{"Abstract": "The pathogenesis of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection involves complex interactions between viral and host factors, leading to diverse clinical manifestations. ZIKV exhibits a broad tropism, infecting various cell types, including neural progenitor cells, which contributes to its neurotropic effects and associated congenital abnormalities. Recent studies have highlighted the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in ZIKV pathogenesis, particularly the involvement of TRIM7, a ubiquitin E3 ligase. TRIM7 has been shown to facilitate ZIKV replication by modulating the host's antiviral immune responses. ZIKV employs multiple strategies to antagonize host immune defenses, including the inhibition of type I interferon signaling pathways, which are crucial for controlling viral infections. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying ZIKV's immune evasion and tissue tropism is essential for developing targeted therapeutic interventions. This review synthesizes current knowledge on ZIKV pathogenesis, emphasizing the interplay between viral factors and host immune responses, and identifies potential avenues for future research."}
