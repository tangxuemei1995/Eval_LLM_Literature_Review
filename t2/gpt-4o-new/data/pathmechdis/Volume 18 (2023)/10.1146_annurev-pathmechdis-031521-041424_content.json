{"Abstract": "Oropharyngeal carcinoma, particularly human papillomavirus (HPV)-related squamous cell carcinoma, has emerged as a distinct clinical entity with unique epidemiological, pathological, and molecular characteristics. This review focuses on the role of HPV in the pathogenesis of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), highlighting the increasing incidence of nonkeratinizing subtypes. HPV-positive OPSCC is characterized by a better prognosis compared to its HPV-negative counterpart, attributed to its distinct molecular profile and immune response. The virus's ability to evade immune detection and promote oncogenesis through the expression of E6 and E7 oncoproteins is a critical factor in its pathophysiology. These oncoproteins disrupt cell cycle regulation and inhibit apoptosis, facilitating tumor progression. The review also discusses the implications of HPV status on treatment strategies, emphasizing the potential for de-escalation of therapy in HPV-positive cases to reduce treatment-related morbidity. Understanding the mechanisms of immune escape and the role of HPV in OPSCC is crucial for developing targeted therapies and improving patient outcomes."}
