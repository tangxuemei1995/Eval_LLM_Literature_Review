{"Abstract": "Molecular monitoring of lymphomas through circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) offers a promising approach for assessing measurable residual disease (MRD) and treatment response. Utilizing next-generation sequencing (NGS), ctDNA provides a non-invasive method to detect minimal disease levels, offering insights into tumor dynamics and therapeutic efficacy. This approach enhances traditional imaging and biopsy methods, allowing for real-time monitoring and personalized treatment adjustments. Recent advancements in NGS technology have improved the sensitivity and specificity of ctDNA detection, enabling earlier intervention and potentially improving patient outcomes. This review highlights the current methodologies, clinical applications, and future directions of ctDNA in lymphoma management, emphasizing its role in precision oncology."}
