{"Abstract": "Adipose tissue, a dynamic organ involved in energy storage and metabolic regulation, undergoes significant remodeling in various pathophysiological conditions. This review explores the mechanisms and implications of adipose tissue remodeling, focusing on browning, fibrosis, and their roles in burns, cachexia, and infectious diseases. Browning, the process of converting white adipose tissue to a more metabolically active brown-like state, is highlighted for its potential therapeutic benefits in metabolic disorders. Conversely, fibrosis, characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition, impairs adipose tissue function and contributes to metabolic dysregulation. In the context of burns and cachexia, adipose tissue remodeling is associated with altered energy balance and systemic inflammation, exacerbating disease progression. Additionally, infectious diseases can induce adipose tissue changes that impact immune responses and metabolic health. Understanding these processes provides insights into novel therapeutic strategies targeting adipose tissue to mitigate the adverse effects of these conditions."}
