{"Abstract": "The liver's unique spatial lobular organization and its dynamic metabolic zonation are critical for maintaining homeostasis and responding to physiological demands. This study explores the intricate interplay between spatiotemporal metabolic liver zonation and its implications for liver pathophysiology. We focus on the role of circadian rhythms and WNT signaling in regulating metabolic processes across different liver zones, highlighting their impact on hepatic detoxification and overall metabolic function. The research underscores the significance of these mechanisms in the context of liver monogenic diseases and broader liver pathologies. By examining the spatial and temporal aspects of liver function, we provide insights into how disruptions in these processes can lead to pathological states. Furthermore, the study discusses the potential of chronopharmacology as a therapeutic strategy to optimize drug efficacy and minimize toxicity by aligning treatment regimens with the liver's metabolic cycles. Our findings emphasize the need for a deeper understanding of liver zonation and its temporal dynamics to develop targeted interventions for liver diseases, ultimately improving patient outcomes and advancing personalized medicine approaches."}
