{"Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prevalent malignancy with complex etiological factors, including metabolic alterations, dietary influences, and microbiome interactions. This review explores the intricate relationship between metabolism and CRC, highlighting how metabolic dysregulation contributes to tumorigenesis. Key metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis and lipid metabolism, are often reprogrammed in CRC cells, promoting growth and survival. Dietary factors, including high-fat and low-fiber diets, are implicated in CRC risk, potentially through their impact on metabolic pathways and the gut microbiome. The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in modulating host metabolism and immune responses, influencing CRC development. Understanding the interplay between diet, metabolism, and the microbiome offers potential for novel preventive and therapeutic strategies. Future research should focus on elucidating these complex interactions to develop targeted interventions that could mitigate CRC risk and improve patient outcomes."}
