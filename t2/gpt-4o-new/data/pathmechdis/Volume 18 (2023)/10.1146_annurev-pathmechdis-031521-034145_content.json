{"Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and parkinsonism represent a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms. Recent advances in genetics have highlighted the oligogenic nature of PD, with key genes such as GBA, LRRK2, and alpha-synuclein playing pivotal roles in its pathogenesis. Functional genomics approaches have elucidated the heterogeneity of PD, revealing complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. The pathophysiological mechanisms involve disruptions in synaptic function, lysosomal degradation, and mitochondrial dynamics, contributing to neuronal dysfunction and death. Understanding the genetic underpinnings and molecular pathways of PD is crucial for developing targeted therapies. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the genetic architecture and pathogenesis of PD, emphasizing the need for integrative research to unravel the disease's complexity and heterogeneity. Future studies should focus on the interplay between genetic variants and cellular pathways to identify novel therapeutic targets and improve patient outcomes."}
