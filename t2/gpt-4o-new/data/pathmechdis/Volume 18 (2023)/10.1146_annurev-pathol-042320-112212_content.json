{"Abstract": "Tuft cells, a conserved epithelial lineage, exhibit context- and tissue-specific programming, playing pivotal roles in various physiological and immunological processes. These cells are characterized by type II taste transduction pathways and are known to secrete signaling molecules such as IL-25, acetylcholine, and cysteinyl leukotrienes. Their ability to modulate mucociliary clearance and promote type 2 immunity highlights their importance in maintaining epithelial homeostasis and responding to parasitic infections. Recent studies have elucidated the diverse functions of tuft cells across different tissues, emphasizing their adaptability and specialized roles. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing tuft cell differentiation and function could provide insights into novel therapeutic strategies for diseases involving epithelial dysfunction and immune dysregulation. This review synthesizes current knowledge on tuft cell biology, focusing on their tissue-specific roles and contributions to immune responses."}
