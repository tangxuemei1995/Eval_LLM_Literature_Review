{"Abstract": "Mastocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by the accumulation of mast cells in various tissues, leading to diverse clinical manifestations. Recent advances in understanding its pathogenesis have highlighted the pivotal role of genetic mutations, particularly the KIT D816V mutation, in disease etiology and progression. This mutation is present in the majority of adult patients and serves as a critical marker for diagnosis and prognostication. Elevated serum tryptase levels further aid in the diagnostic process, correlating with disease burden and severity. Emerging concepts in therapy focus on targeted treatments that inhibit the aberrant signaling pathways activated by KIT mutations. Novel agents, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, have shown promise in clinical trials, offering potential for improved management of symptoms and reduction in anaphylaxis risk. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the genetic underpinnings of mastocytosis and explores innovative therapeutic strategies, underscoring the importance of personalized medicine in optimizing patient outcomes."}
