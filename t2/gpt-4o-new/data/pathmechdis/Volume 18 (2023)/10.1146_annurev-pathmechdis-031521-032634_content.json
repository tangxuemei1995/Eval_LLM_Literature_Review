{"Abstract": "Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten ingestion in genetically predisposed individuals, primarily associated with HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 alleles. The pathogenesis involves an aberrant immune response where gluten peptides, modified by transglutaminase 2, are presented by antigen-presenting cells to CD4+ T cells, leading to an inflammatory cascade. This response results in the activation of B cells, producing autoantibodies against transglutaminase 2, and subsequent intestinal tissue damage. Understanding the immunobiology of celiac disease, including the roles of T and B cells, is crucial for developing targeted therapies and improving diagnostic strategies. This review explores the molecular mechanisms underlying celiac disease pathogenesis."}
