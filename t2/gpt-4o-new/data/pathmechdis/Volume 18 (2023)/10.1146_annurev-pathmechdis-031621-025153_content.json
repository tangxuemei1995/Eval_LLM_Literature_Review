{"Abstract": "African trypanosomiasis, commonly known as sleeping sickness, is a parasitic disease caused by African trypanosomes. The pathogenesis of this disease is intricately linked to the parasite's ability to evade the host immune system through antigenic variation, primarily mediated by the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). This mechanism allows the trypanosomes to persist in the host by continuously altering their surface antigens, thereby avoiding immune detection. Recent studies have highlighted the role of apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) in the host's defense against trypanosomes, as certain APOL1 variants confer resistance to the parasite. However, these variants are also associated with an increased risk of kidney disease, presenting a complex interplay between host defense and disease susceptibility. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying VSG switching and APOL1-mediated resistance is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies against African trypanosomiasis and mitigating associated kidney disease risks."}
