{"Abstract": "The intricate interplay between neuroepithelial components and cancerous tissues has emerged as a pivotal area of oncological research. This study delves into the mechanisms by which nerves influence tumor progression, focusing on axonogenesis and neurogenesis within the tumor microenvironment. We explore the phenomenon of perineural invasion, where cancer cells encroach upon and utilize nerve structures to facilitate metastasis. Additionally, the potential for neuronal transdifferentiation within tumors is examined, highlighting how cancer cells may acquire neuronal-like properties to enhance their survival and dissemination. By elucidating these neuroepithelial interactions, we aim to uncover novel therapeutic targets that could disrupt the supportive role of nerves in cancer progression. Our findings underscore the importance of a multidisciplinary approach, integrating neurobiology and oncology, to better understand and combat the complex dynamics of cancer growth and spread. This research contributes to a growing body of evidence that positions the nervous system as a critical player in cancer biology."}
