{"Abstract": "Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by airway inflammation and obstruction, often leading to significant morbidity. Despite extensive research, the precise mechanisms underlying airway obstruction in asthma remain incompletely understood. This review explores the role of mucus hypersecretion and its components, particularly focusing on galectin-10, a protein implicated in the formation of Charcot-Leyden crystals, which are frequently observed in asthmatic airways. The interaction between galectin-10 and neutrophils, a type of immune cell involved in the inflammatory response, is examined to elucidate their contribution to airway obstruction. Neutrophils, traditionally associated with bacterial infections, are increasingly recognized for their role in non-infectious inflammatory conditions like asthma. Understanding the complex interplay between these factors is crucial for developing targeted therapies aimed at reducing mucus production and improving airway patency. This review highlights the need for further research to clarify these mechanisms and improve clinical outcomes for asthma patients."}
