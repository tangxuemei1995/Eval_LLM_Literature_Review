{"Abstract": "Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), encompassing exosomes and microvesicles, are increasingly recognized as pivotal players in the tumor microenvironment. These multifunctional entities facilitate intercellular communication by transferring bioactive molecules, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, to various recipient cells such as carcinoma-associated fibroblasts and tumor-infiltrating cells. This transfer modulates the behavior of these cells, promoting processes like cell migration and tumor invasion, which are critical for cancer progression. The diverse cargoes of EVs reflect the dynamic state of the tumor, offering insights into tumor biology and potential biomarkers for liquid biopsies. Recent studies highlight the role of EVs in remodeling the tumor microenvironment, enhancing angiogenesis, and evading immune surveillance. Understanding the mechanisms governing EV biogenesis, release, and uptake is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies aimed at disrupting these pathways. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the functional roles of tumor-derived EVs, emphasizing their potential as diagnostic tools and therapeutic targets in oncology, thereby advancing the field of cancer research and treatment."}
