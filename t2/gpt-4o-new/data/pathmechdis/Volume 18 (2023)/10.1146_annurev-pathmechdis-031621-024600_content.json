{"Abstract": "Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal malignancies, largely due to its complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that contributes to pathogenesis and therapeutic resistance. This study explores the intricate interactions within the TME, focusing on the roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and stromal components in modulating tumor immunology. The dense stroma not only supports tumor growth but also impedes drug delivery, fostering a milieu of resistance. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies. By targeting the TME, particularly the CAFs and stromal barriers, there is potential to enhance treatment efficacy and improve patient outcomes in pancreatic cancer."}
