{"Abstract": "Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) remains a significant global health challenge, with its pathogenesis being a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. Recent advances have elucidated the role of programmed cell death (PCD) pathways, including apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis, in the progression of ALD. These pathways contribute to hepatocyte injury and inflammation, exacerbating liver damage. Additionally, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) have been identified as critical mediators in the immune response to alcohol-induced liver injury, recognizing damage-associated molecular patterns and activating inflammatory cascades. The complement system, traditionally known for its role in innate immunity, has also been implicated in ALD pathogenesis, influencing both inflammation and fibrosis. Furthermore, the gut-liver axis has emerged as a pivotal factor, with gut microbiota dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability contributing to liver inflammation and injury. Understanding these mechanisms offers potential therapeutic targets for ALD, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches to manage and treat this complex disease."}
