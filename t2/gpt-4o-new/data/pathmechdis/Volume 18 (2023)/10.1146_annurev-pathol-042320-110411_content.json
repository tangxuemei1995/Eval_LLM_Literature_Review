{"Abstract": "Red blood cell alloimmunization is a significant complication in transfusion medicine, particularly affecting patients with chronic transfusion needs such as those with sickle cell disease. This process involves the immune system recognizing transfused red blood cells as foreign, leading to the production of alloantibodies. These antibodies can cause hemolytic transfusion reactions, complicating future transfusions and limiting compatible blood availability. The development of alloimmunization is influenced by factors such as genetic predisposition, the frequency of transfusions, and the degree of antigenic disparity between donor and recipient. This review explores the immunological mechanisms underlying alloimmunization, its clinical consequences, and strategies to mitigate its impact. Emphasis is placed on the importance of extended antigen matching and the potential role of novel immunomodulatory therapies. Understanding the pathophysiology and management of red blood cell alloimmunization is crucial for improving transfusion outcomes and quality of life for affected patients."}
