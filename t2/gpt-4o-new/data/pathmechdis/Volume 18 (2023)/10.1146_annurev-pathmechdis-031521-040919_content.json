{"Abstract": "Osteoclasts are specialized, multinucleated cells pivotal in bone resorption, playing a crucial role in skeletal remodeling and homeostasis. These cells, derived from hematopoietic progenitors, orchestrate the degradation of bone matrix through osteolysis, a process essential for the maintenance of bone integrity and mineral balance. The regulation of osteoclastogenesis, the formation and differentiation of osteoclasts, is influenced by a complex interplay of signaling pathways and cytokines, including RANKL, M-CSF, and OPG. Dysregulation of osteoclast activity is implicated in various pathological conditions, such as osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and metastatic bone disease, where excessive bone resorption leads to weakened bone structure. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing osteoclast function and differentiation offers potential therapeutic targets for treating bone-related disorders. This review highlights the critical role of osteoclasts in bone biology, emphasizing their function as master sculptors of bone architecture."}
