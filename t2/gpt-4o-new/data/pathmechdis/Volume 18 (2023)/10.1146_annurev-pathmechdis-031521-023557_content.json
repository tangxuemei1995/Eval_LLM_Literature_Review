{"Abstract": "Collective metastasis, a process where tumor cell clusters migrate and colonize distant organs, plays a pivotal role in cancer progression. This study investigates the orchestration of collective migration and metastasis by tumor cell clusters, emphasizing the mechanisms of polyclonal seeding and collective signaling. Circulating tumor cell clusters exhibit enhanced metastatic potential compared to single cells, attributed to their ability to maintain intercellular communication and cooperative behavior. The research highlights the significance of collective signaling pathways in facilitating the survival and adaptation of these clusters in the bloodstream and during colonization. Understanding these processes provides insights into potential therapeutic targets aimed at disrupting collective migration and reducing metastatic spread, offering promising avenues for cancer treatment."}
