{"Abstract": "The study of excited states in molecular organic aggregates is pivotal for advancing optoelectronic applications, including organic photovoltaics and light-emitting devices. This research focuses on the theoretical modeling of excited-state dynamics, emphasizing the interplay between radiative and nonradiative decay processes. By employing advanced exciton models, we explore the role of conical intersections in facilitating ultrafast nonradiative transitions. The investigation extends to phenomena such as singlet fission and triplet-triplet annihilation, which are crucial for enhancing device efficiency. Our models provide insights into the mechanisms governing energy transfer and loss, offering pathways to optimize material performance. Through a combination of quantum chemical calculations and kinetic modeling, we aim to elucidate the fundamental processes that dictate the behavior of excited states in molecular aggregates, thereby contributing to the design of next-generation optoelectronic materials."}
