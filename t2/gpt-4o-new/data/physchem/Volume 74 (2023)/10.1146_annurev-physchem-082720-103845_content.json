{"Abstract": "Gas-phase computational spectroscopy has emerged as a pivotal tool in elucidating the structural and dynamical properties of the molecular bricks of life, such as amino acids, nucleotides, and simple sugars. This study addresses the challenges inherent in accurately predicting rotational and vibrational spectra of these complex molecules. The inherent flexibility and anharmonicity of these biomolecules pose significant computational challenges, necessitating advanced theoretical methods and high-level quantum chemical calculations. By integrating state-of-the-art computational techniques with experimental data, this research aims to enhance the accuracy of spectral predictions, thereby providing deeper insights into the fundamental properties of biomolecules in the gas phase. The findings underscore the importance of computational spectroscopy in advancing our understanding of molecular structure and dynamics, with implications for fields ranging from astrochemistry to biophysics."}
