{"Abstract": "The study of excited-state dynamics in organic thin films is crucial for optimizing their optoelectronic properties. This research presents an innovative approach using single-shot transient absorption spectroscopy to monitor these dynamics in situ during the deposition and processing of organic films. The instrument design allows for real-time observation of molecular aggregation and changes in electronic states, providing insights into the effects of thermal annealing and other processing conditions. By capturing transient absorption spectra with high temporal resolution, the method reveals the evolution of excited states and their lifetimes, offering a deeper understanding of the relationship between film morphology and photophysical properties. This technique enhances the ability to tailor organic materials for applications in photovoltaics and light-emitting devices, marking a significant advancement in the field of organic electronics."}
