{"Abstract": "The green fluorescent protein (GFP) is a pivotal tool in molecular and cellular biology, renowned for its unique photophysical properties. This study investigates the dynamics of photoacid behavior within GFP using ultrafast spectroscopy techniques, including stimulated Raman spectroscopy. We explore the coherence and proton tunneling processes that underpin the fluorescence mechanism of GFP. Our findings reveal that the ultrafast proton transfer dynamics are crucial for the efficient fluorescence emission, with coherence playing a significant role in facilitating proton tunneling. These insights enhance the understanding of GFP's photophysics, potentially informing the design of novel fluorescent proteins with tailored properties for advanced imaging applications. The study underscores the importance of integrating ultrafast spectroscopic methods to unravel complex biological processes at the molecular level."}
