{"Abstract": "Atmospheric aerosols play a critical role in climate regulation and air quality, yet their formation and growth mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study employs advanced spectroscopic techniques to investigate clusters of atmospheric relevance, focusing on their role in new particle formation. By analyzing the molecular composition and structural dynamics of these clusters, we aim to elucidate the pathways through which they contribute to aerosol growth. Our findings reveal distinct spectroscopic signatures that correlate with specific atmospheric conditions, providing insights into the nucleation processes that drive particle formation. The results underscore the importance of cluster chemistry in influencing aerosol properties and, consequently, their climatic effects. This research advances our understanding of atmospheric aerosols, offering potential pathways for improved climate models and mitigation strategies. The integration of spectroscopy in atmospheric studies presents a promising avenue for unraveling the complexities of aerosol-climate interactions."}
