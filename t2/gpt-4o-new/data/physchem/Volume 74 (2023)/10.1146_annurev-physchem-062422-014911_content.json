{"Abstract": "This study delves into the mechanisms of photothermalization in plasmonic nanostructures, focusing on the steady-state behavior of metallic nanoparticles. By employing Raman thermometry, we investigate the generation and dynamics of nonthermal carriers, particularly hot electrons, which play a crucial role in photocatalysis. Our findings reveal the intricate balance between energy absorption, carrier relaxation, and heat dissipation, providing insights into the efficiency of energy conversion processes. The results underscore the importance of understanding the steady-state conditions to optimize the performance of plasmonic systems in applications such as solar energy harvesting and chemical transformations. This research advances the fundamental knowledge of photothermal effects in nanoscale materials, paving the way for enhanced design strategies in nanotechnology."}
