{"Abstract": "Ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy, enabled by free-electron lasers, offers unprecedented insights into elementary molecular events, particularly those involving conical intersections. These intersections, critical in photochemistry, facilitate non-adiabatic transitions that drive chemical reactions. By capturing transient states with femtosecond resolution, X-ray probes elucidate the dynamics of electronic and nuclear rearrangements at these intersections. This study highlights the application of ultrafast X-ray techniques to track real-time changes in molecular systems, providing a detailed understanding of the interplay between electronic and structural dynamics. The ability to observe these rapid processes opens new avenues for controlling photochemical pathways, with implications for fields ranging from materials science to biology. Our findings demonstrate the potential of X-ray free-electron lasers to revolutionize the study of molecular dynamics, offering a powerful tool for probing the fundamental processes that underpin chemical reactivity and energy conversion."}
