{"Abstract": "The study of adsorption at nanoconfined solidâ€“water interfaces is crucial for understanding the behavior of ions and molecules in nanoporous materials. This research investigates the effects of nanoconfinement on surface complexation and speciation within nanopores. Utilizing advanced spectroscopic techniques and molecular simulations, we explore how confinement alters the physicochemical properties of adsorbates and the solid surface. Our findings reveal that nanoconfinement significantly influences the distribution and speciation of ions, leading to unique surface complexation phenomena not observed in bulk systems. The results demonstrate that the restricted environment within nanopores enhances specific interactions between adsorbates and the solid surface, which can be attributed to altered hydration dynamics and electrostatic interactions. This study provides new insights into the fundamental processes governing adsorption in nanoconfined systems, with implications for the design of advanced materials for catalysis, separation, and environmental remediation. Understanding these interactions at the nanoscale is essential for optimizing the performance of nanoporous materials in various applications."}
