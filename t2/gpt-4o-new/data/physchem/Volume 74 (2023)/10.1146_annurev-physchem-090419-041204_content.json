{"Abstract": "This study explores the local conformation and conformational disorder of DNA backbones using site-specific exciton-coupled dimer probe spectroscopy. By employing advanced 2D spectroscopy techniques, we investigate the dynamic behavior of DNA, particularly focusing on DNA breathing and its implications for protein-DNA interactions and DNA replication. The use of site-specific fluorescence labeling allows for precise monitoring of conformational changes at the molecular level, providing insights into the structural dynamics of DNA. Our findings reveal significant variations in DNA backbone conformation, which are crucial for understanding the mechanisms of DNA replication and the role of conformational disorder in biological processes. This research enhances our understanding of DNA structural dynamics and offers potential applications in the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting DNA-protein interactions. The study underscores the importance of exciton-coupled dimers as a powerful tool for probing DNA conformational landscapes."}
