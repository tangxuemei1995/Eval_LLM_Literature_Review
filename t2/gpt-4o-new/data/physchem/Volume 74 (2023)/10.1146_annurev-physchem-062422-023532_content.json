{"Abstract": "The study of many-body effects in aqueous systems is crucial for understanding complex intermolecular interactions that govern the behavior of water and solute molecules. This research explores the synergies between advanced interaction analysis techniques and the development of polarizable force fields to accurately model these effects. By employing many-body expansion methods, we dissect the contributions of individual and collective interactions, providing insights into the non-additive nature of forces in aqueous environments. The integration of these techniques with molecular dynamics simulations allows for a more precise representation of polarization effects, which are often neglected in traditional force fields. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating many-body interactions in the design of next-generation force fields, which can significantly enhance the predictive power of simulations in biological and chemical systems. This work paves the way for more accurate and efficient computational models, facilitating a deeper understanding of the fundamental processes in aqueous systems and their implications in various scientific and industrial applications."}
