{"Abstract": "The formation of stable glasses through surface-mediated processes has garnered significant attention due to their unique properties and potential applications. This study explores the role of physical vapor deposition in creating stable glasses, emphasizing the importance of surface-mediated equilibration. Enhanced surface mobility is identified as a critical factor facilitating the structural anisotropy observed in these materials. By examining the glass transition dynamics, we elucidate the mechanisms by which surface interactions contribute to the stabilization of glassy states. Our findings suggest that the controlled manipulation of surface conditions during deposition can lead to the production of glasses with superior stability and distinct structural characteristics. This research advances the understanding of glass formation and opens new avenues for designing materials with tailored properties for technological applications."}
