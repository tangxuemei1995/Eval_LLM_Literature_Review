{"Abstract": "The Artificial Force Induced Reaction (AFIR) method represents a significant advancement in the field of computational chemistry, particularly in the discovery of novel reaction pathways. This study explores the application of AFIR in mapping potential energy surfaces (PES) to identify feasible reaction paths in organic synthesis. By employing quantum chemical calculations, the AFIR method facilitates the automatic generation of reaction path networks, which are crucial for understanding complex chemical transformations. The integration of kinetic simulations with these networks allows for the prediction of reaction outcomes and the identification of optimal conditions for desired transformations. This approach not only enhances the efficiency of reaction discovery but also provides insights into the mechanistic aspects of chemical reactions. The study demonstrates the potential of AFIR in revolutionizing organic synthesis by enabling the systematic exploration of reaction space, thereby paving the way for the development of new synthetic methodologies. The findings underscore the importance of computational tools in advancing the frontiers of chemical research."}
