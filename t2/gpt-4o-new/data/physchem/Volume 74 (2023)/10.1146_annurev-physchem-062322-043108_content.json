{"Abstract": "The study of magneto-optical properties in noble metal nanostructures has garnered significant interest due to their potential applications in advanced photonic and spintronic devices. This research explores the plasmon-mediated magneto-optics of these nanostructures, focusing on their unique ability to enhance and manipulate light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. By examining superatoms, which mimic the electronic properties of atoms, we investigate their role in spin-polarized emission and the resulting effects on magnetic circular photoluminescence. Additionally, the study delves into the magnetic circular dichroism exhibited by these nanostructures, providing insights into their optical activity under magnetic fields. Our findings reveal that the interplay between plasmonic resonances and magnetic fields in noble metal nanostructures can lead to novel optical phenomena, paving the way for the development of new materials with tailored magneto-optical properties. This work contributes to the fundamental understanding of light manipulation in nanostructured materials."}
