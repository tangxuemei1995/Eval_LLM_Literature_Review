{"Abstract": "This study explores the optical signatures of stochastic processes in many-body exciton scattering, focusing on excitation-induced dephasing and its impact on quantum dynamics. Utilizing coherent nonlinear spectroscopy, we investigate the intricate interplay between many-body effects and quantum stochastic calculus. Our findings reveal that stochastic processes significantly influence exciton dephasing, leading to observable changes in optical spectra. By employing advanced theoretical models, we demonstrate how these processes manifest in the coherent response of excitonic systems, providing insights into the underlying quantum dynamics. The results highlight the importance of considering stochastic influences in the analysis of many-body exciton interactions, offering a deeper understanding of the dephasing mechanisms at play. This work paves the way for future studies on the role of stochasticity in quantum systems, with potential implications for the development of quantum technologies and materials."}
