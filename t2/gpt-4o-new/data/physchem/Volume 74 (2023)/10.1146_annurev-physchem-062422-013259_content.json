{"Abstract": "Density Functional Theory (DFT) has become a cornerstone in the study of electronic structures due to its balance of accuracy and computational efficiency. This research investigates the role of exact constraints and appropriate norms in enhancing the predictive power of density functionals, particularly in the calculation of exchange-correlation energies. By systematically incorporating exact constraints, such as the known limits and sum rules, and selecting norms that align with physical principles, we aim to improve the reliability of DFT predictions. Our findings suggest that these methodological refinements lead to significant improvements in the accuracy of electronic structure calculations, as evidenced by comparisons with experimental data and high-level quantum chemical methods. The study underscores the importance of theoretical rigor in the development of density functionals and provides a framework for future advancements in DFT, potentially broadening its applicability to complex systems where traditional approaches may falter."}
