{"Abstract": "The dairy industry has long grappled with the challenges posed by bacteriophages, which can disrupt fermentation processes by infecting and lysing bacterial cultures essential for product consistency and quality. This review examines recent advancements in understanding phageâ€“host interactions and the development of phage resistance strategies. Key innovations include the identification of phage-resistant bacterial strains and the application of genetic tools to enhance bacterial resilience. Conjugation, a natural mechanism of horizontal gene transfer, has emerged as a promising method to disseminate phage resistance genes across bacterial populations. Additionally, the integration of phage monitoring systems and adaptive management practices has significantly reduced the incidence of phage-related disruptions in food fermentations. While challenges remain, these developments suggest that the dairy industry is moving towards a more controlled and predictable fermentation environment, potentially solving the longstanding issue of bacteriophage interference."}
