{"Abstract": "Microgreens, young edible plants harvested at the cotyledon stage, have gained significant attention due to their rich nutritional profile and potential to enhance food security. This review provides a comprehensive update on recent advancements in microgreen production systems, emphasizing their application in home, commercial, and space farming. The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has revolutionized microgreen cultivation, enabling precise monitoring and control of growth conditions, thus optimizing yield and quality. In the context of space farming, microgreens offer a viable solution for sustainable food production in extraterrestrial environments, addressing the challenges of limited space and resources. The review also explores the role of microgreens in diversifying diets and improving nutritional intake, highlighting their potential to contribute to global food security. By synthesizing the latest research, this paper aims to inform future developments in microgreen cultivation and their broader implications for sustainable agriculture."}
