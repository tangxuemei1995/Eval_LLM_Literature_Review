{"Abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into food safety protocols presents a transformative opportunity to enhance public health outcomes. This study explores the application of machine learning, computer vision, and predictive analytics in identifying and mitigating risks within the food supply chain. Machine learning algorithms can analyze vast datasets to predict potential contamination events, while computer vision systems can automate the inspection of food products, ensuring compliance with safety standards. Predictive analytics further aids in forecasting supply chain disruptions, allowing for proactive measures to prevent foodborne illnesses. By leveraging these AI technologies, stakeholders can improve the detection of hazards, optimize resource allocation, and enhance traceability from farm to table. This research underscores the potential of AI to revolutionize food safety practices, ultimately contributing to a more resilient and secure food system. Future work should focus on integrating these technologies into existing frameworks to maximize their impact on public health."}
