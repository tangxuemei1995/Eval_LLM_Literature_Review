{"Abstract": "Ergothioneine, a unique diet-derived antioxidant, has garnered significant attention due to its potential health benefits and distinctive properties. Unlike other antioxidants, ergothioneine is actively transported into cells via the OCTN1 transporter, suggesting a specific physiological role. This compound exhibits potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, contributing to cytoprotection under oxidative stress conditions. Ergothioneine's ability to localize within mitochondria further underscores its importance in cellular defense mechanisms, as it may help mitigate mitochondrial oxidative damage and maintain cellular homeostasis. Emerging research highlights its potential therapeutic applications in conditions characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation. This review synthesizes current knowledge on ergothioneine's biochemical properties, its transport and distribution in the body, and its implications for health, emphasizing the need for further studies to fully elucidate its role in human physiology and potential as a dietary supplement."}
