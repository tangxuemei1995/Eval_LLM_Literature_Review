{"Abstract": "The modulation of the gut microbiome through dietary fiber interventions presents a promising avenue for personalized nutrition strategies aimed at improving health outcomes. This study explores the potential of prebiotics to influence gut microbiota composition and function, focusing on the role of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) in fiber metabolism. By integrating precision nutrition approaches, we aim to predict individual responses to dietary fiber based on microbiome profiles. The research highlights the variability in gut microbiome composition and its impact on the efficacy of fiber interventions, emphasizing the need for personalized dietary recommendations. Advanced bioinformatics tools and machine learning models are employed to analyze microbiome data, enabling the identification of key microbial taxa and CAZymes associated with beneficial health effects. This work underscores the importance of tailoring dietary interventions to individual microbiome characteristics, paving the way for more effective strategies in managing health through diet. Future research should focus on validating these predictive models in diverse populations."}
