{"Abstract": "The strategic positioning of phenolic antioxidants at the oilâ€“water interface in emulsions is crucial for enhancing their efficacy in inhibiting lipid oxidation. This study explores various methodologies to optimize the interfacial localization of phenolic compounds, including the use of phenolipids and the creation of antioxidant reservoirs. By focusing on the interface, these antioxidants can more effectively scavenge free radicals and chelate metal ions, thereby prolonging the shelf life and nutritional quality of emulsion-based products. The research highlights the benefits of modifying the physicochemical properties of phenolic antioxidants to improve their affinity for the interface, thus maximizing their protective effects. The findings suggest that targeted delivery of antioxidants at the interface not only enhances their performance but also reduces the required concentration, offering economic and sensory advantages. This approach presents a promising avenue for the development of more stable and health-promoting emulsion systems."}
