{"Abstract": "The engineering of nutritionally improved edible plant oils is a promising approach to enhance human health. This study explores the application of metabolic engineering and gene editing techniques to increase the content of beneficial compounds such as high oleic acids, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), plant sterols, carotenoids, and vitamin E in seed oils. By manipulating specific biosynthetic pathways, we aim to produce oils with enhanced nutritional profiles. The integration of advanced genetic tools allows for precise modifications, offering a sustainable solution to meet dietary needs. This research highlights the potential of biofortified plant oils in addressing global nutritional challenges and improving public health outcomes."}
