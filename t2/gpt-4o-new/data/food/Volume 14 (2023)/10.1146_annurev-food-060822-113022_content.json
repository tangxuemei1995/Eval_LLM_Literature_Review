{"Abstract": "The exploration of genebank collections offers a promising avenue for enhancing human health through the identification of metabolic signatures associated with phytonutrients. These collections, which house a vast array of plant genetic diversity, remain an underexploited resource in the quest to improve nutrition and health outcomes. By leveraging plant metabolomics, researchers can uncover the natural variance in phytonutrient profiles across different plant species and varieties. This study aims to highlight the potential of genebank collections in identifying unique metabolic signatures that could contribute to human health. Through advanced analytical techniques, such as mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance, the metabolic profiles of diverse plant accessions can be characterized, revealing bioactive compounds with potential health benefits. The integration of these findings into nutritional science could lead to the development of novel dietary strategies and functional foods. Ultimately, this research underscores the importance of preserving and studying plant genetic resources to unlock their potential in addressing global health challenges."}
