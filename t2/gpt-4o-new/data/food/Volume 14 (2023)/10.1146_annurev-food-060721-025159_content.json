{"Abstract": "This review explores the burgeoning field of food nanotechnology, focusing on the use of nanoparticles for oral delivery. It delves into the biological fate of these nanoparticles, examining their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion processes. The review highlights various evaluation models used to assess the efficacy and safety of nanoparticle-based delivery systems. Special attention is given to the interaction between nanoparticles and gut microbiota, considering how these interactions can influence both the functionality of the nanoparticles and the health of the host. By synthesizing current research, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential and challenges of using nanoparticles in food applications, offering insights into future directions for research and development in this innovative field."}
