{"Abstract": "Bovine colostrum, the nutrient-rich fluid produced by cows shortly after giving birth, is gaining attention for its potential health benefits in both veterinary and human applications. This critical review examines the bioactive components of bovine colostrum, including immunoglobulins and growth factors, and their roles in enhancing immune function and promoting gut health. The review highlights recent studies on its efficacy as a functional food, exploring its therapeutic potential in disease prevention and management. Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges and future directions in the utilization of bovine colostrum, emphasizing the need for standardized processing methods to ensure safety and efficacy."}
