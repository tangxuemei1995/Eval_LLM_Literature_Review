{"Abstract": "Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) is a naturally occurring compound found in cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage. Upon ingestion, I3C is converted into various bioactive compounds, including 3,3′-diindolylmethane (DIM), which have been associated with numerous health benefits. This review explores the occurrence of I3C in dietary sources and its potential health-promoting properties, including anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these benefits are examined, highlighting I3C's role in modulating estrogen metabolism, inducing apoptosis, and inhibiting cell proliferation. Additionally, the review discusses the impact of I3C and DIM on signaling pathways, such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), which contribute to their therapeutic potential. Understanding these mechanisms provides insights into the development of I3C-based interventions for disease prevention and health promotion."}
