{"Abstract": "Microbubbles, characterized by their small size and high surface area, are emerging as a transformative technology in the food industry. This review explores their potential applications in enhancing sustainability, food safety, and food security. Microbubbles can improve the efficiency of food processing by reducing energy consumption and enhancing mass transfer processes, thus contributing to more sustainable practices. Their role in novel food production, such as in the creation of foams and emulsions, offers innovative solutions for texture and flavor enhancement. Additionally, microbubbles can aid in the removal of contaminants and pathogens, thereby improving food safety. The integration of microbubble technology in food systems presents a promising avenue for addressing global challenges in food security, offering a pathway to more resilient and efficient food production systems."}
