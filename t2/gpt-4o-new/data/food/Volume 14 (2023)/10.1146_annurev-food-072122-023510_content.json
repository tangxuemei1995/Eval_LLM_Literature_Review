{"Abstract": "The structuring of starch through enzymatic approaches has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance its functionality for various industrial applications. This study explores the relationship between enzymatic modification and the molecular structure of starch, aiming to improve its functional properties. Enzymes such as amylases, glucosyltransferases, and branching enzymes are employed to alter the amylose and amylopectin components, thereby modifying the starch's crystalline and amorphous regions. These modifications can lead to improved solubility, gelatinization, and retrogradation properties, which are critical for applications in food, pharmaceuticals, and biodegradable materials. The research highlights the importance of understanding the enzyme-substrate interactions and the resulting structural changes at the molecular level. By tailoring the enzymatic treatment conditions, such as pH, temperature, and enzyme concentration, specific functional attributes of starch can be achieved. This study provides insights into the potential of enzymatic strategies to create starches with desired functionalities, offering a sustainable and efficient alternative to chemical modifications. The findings underscore the significance of a detailed understanding of the structure-function relationship in starch to optimize its application across various industries."}
