{"Abstract": "This study investigates the molecular changes in meat proteins during various processing methods and their subsequent effects on quality and nutritional values. Processing techniques, such as heating, curing, and fermentation, induce structural modifications in proteins, influencing texture, flavor, and digestibility. These alterations can enhance or diminish the nutritional profile, impacting essential amino acid availability and bioactive compound retention. Additionally, certain processing methods may introduce health risks through the formation of harmful compounds. Understanding these molecular transformations is crucial for optimizing processing conditions to maintain or improve meat quality while minimizing potential health risks. This research provides insights into developing healthier and more nutritious meat products."}
