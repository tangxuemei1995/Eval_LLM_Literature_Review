{"Abstract": "The INFOGEST in vitro digestion model has emerged as a pivotal tool for simulating human gastrointestinal processes, offering insights into the bioavailability and bioaccessibility of nutrients and bioactive compounds in foods. This review synthesizes recent advancements in the application of the INFOGEST model to various food matrices, highlighting its role in evaluating the nutritional and functional properties of foods. By mimicking the physiological conditions of the human digestive tract, the model provides a standardized approach to assess how different food components are released, transformed, and absorbed. The review discusses the model's utility in studying functional foods, which are designed to deliver health benefits beyond basic nutrition. It also addresses the challenges and limitations of the model, such as its inability to fully replicate the complexity of in vivo digestion. Overall, the INFOGEST model is a valuable tool for researchers aiming to optimize food formulations and enhance the health-promoting properties of dietary products."}
