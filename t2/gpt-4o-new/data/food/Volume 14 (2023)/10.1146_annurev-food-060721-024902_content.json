{"Abstract": "Ferritin, a ubiquitous iron-storage protein, exhibits dual functionality in its holo and apo forms, offering promising applications in both iron supplementation and delivery systems. The holo form of ferritin, rich in iron, serves as an efficient vehicle for iron supplementation, addressing deficiencies in both animal and plant systems. This form ensures bioavailability and controlled release, enhancing nutritional outcomes. Conversely, the apo form, devoid of iron, presents a versatile platform for delivery systems. Its hollow structure allows encapsulation of various therapeutic agents, facilitating targeted delivery and controlled release. This dual functionality underscores ferritin's potential in biotechnological and medical applications, offering a sustainable approach to iron supplementation and innovative delivery solutions. This review explores the structural and functional dynamics of ferritin, highlighting its role in advancing nutritional and therapeutic strategies across diverse biological systems."}
