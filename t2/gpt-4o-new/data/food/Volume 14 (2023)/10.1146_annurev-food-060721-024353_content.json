{"Abstract": "The burgeoning field of biotechnology presents transformative opportunities for the development of future food lipids, addressing both nutritional and sustainability challenges. This review explores the potential of microbial lipids, which are produced through metabolic engineering, as a sustainable alternative to traditional lipid sources. Advances in enzymatic modification techniques allow for the precise tailoring of lipid structures, enhancing their functional and nutritional properties. Structural lipids, including phospholipids, are highlighted for their critical roles in food texture and health benefits, with biotechnological innovations enabling their efficient production and modification. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, such as optimizing production processes for scalability and cost-effectiveness, and ensuring regulatory compliance and consumer acceptance. The integration of biotechnology in lipid production promises to revolutionize the food industry, offering healthier and more sustainable lipid options. Future research should focus on overcoming current limitations and exploring novel applications of engineered lipids in food systems."}
