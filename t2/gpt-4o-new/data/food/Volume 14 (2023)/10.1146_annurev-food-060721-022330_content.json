{"Abstract": "Mechano-bactericidal surfaces offer a promising approach to enhancing food safety by physically disrupting bacterial cells. This review explores the underlying mechanisms of bactericidal action, focusing on the role of nanoscale topographies. Advances in nanofabrication techniques are discussed, highlighting their potential to create effective antimicrobial surfaces for food-contact applications. The integration of these surfaces into food processing and packaging systems is examined, emphasizing their ability to reduce microbial contamination. Future prospects include optimizing surface designs for specific food industry needs, thereby improving food safety and extending shelf life while minimizing chemical preservatives."}
