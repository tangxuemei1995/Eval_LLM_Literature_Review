{"Abstract": "The development of novel colloidal food ingredients through the formation of protein complexes and conjugates presents a promising avenue for enhancing food quality and functionality. This study explores the interactions between proteins, polysaccharides, and polyphenols to form stable complexes and conjugates that can be utilized as innovative colloidal ingredients. By leveraging the unique properties of these biopolymers, such as their ability to form gels, emulsions, and foams, the research aims to improve the texture, stability, and nutritional profile of food products. The synergistic effects of protein-polysaccharide and protein-polyphenol interactions are examined, highlighting their potential to enhance antioxidant activity and bioavailability of nutrients. Advanced characterization techniques are employed to elucidate the structural and functional properties of these complexes and conjugates. The findings suggest that these novel colloidal ingredients could play a significant role in the development of healthier and more sustainable food systems, meeting the growing consumer demand for functional foods."}
