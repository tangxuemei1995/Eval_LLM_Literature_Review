{"Abstract": "The growing demand for sustainable food production necessitates innovative approaches to ingredient processing. This study explores mild fractionation techniques, including dry fractionation and mild wet separation, to enhance the sustainability of plant protein extraction. By minimizing energy and water consumption, these methods offer a more resource-efficient alternative to conventional processes. The research focuses on optimizing the functionality of plant proteins, ensuring that the nutritional and sensory qualities are maintained or improved. Through a comparative analysis, the study evaluates the efficiency of these mild fractionation techniques in terms of yield, purity, and environmental impact. Results indicate that mild fractionation not only reduces resource use but also enhances the functional properties of plant proteins, making them suitable for a wider range of food applications. This approach aligns with the goals of sustainable food systems by reducing waste and promoting the use of plant-based ingredients, thereby contributing to a more sustainable food supply chain."}
