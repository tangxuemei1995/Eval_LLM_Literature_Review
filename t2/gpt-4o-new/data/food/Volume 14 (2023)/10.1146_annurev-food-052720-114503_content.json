{"Abstract": "Nondigestible functional oligosaccharides have garnered significant attention for their prebiotic effects and potential to enhance intestinal health. This review explores the enzymatic production of these oligosaccharides, highlighting the advantages of enzymatic methods over traditional chemical synthesis, including specificity, efficiency, and environmental sustainability. The paper delves into various enzymes utilized in the production process, such as glycosyltransferases and glycosidases, and discusses their roles in tailoring oligosaccharide structures to optimize prebiotic activity. Furthermore, the review examines the incorporation of functional oligosaccharides into food products, emphasizing their ability to modulate gut microbiota, enhance nutrient absorption, and improve overall gastrointestinal function. By integrating recent advancements in enzymatic technology and food science, this study underscores the potential of functional oligosaccharides as a versatile ingredient in functional foods aimed at promoting intestinal health and preventing gastrointestinal disorders. Future research directions and challenges in commercial applications are also discussed."}
