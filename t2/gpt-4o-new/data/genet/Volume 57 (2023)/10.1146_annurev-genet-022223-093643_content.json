{"Abstract": "Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), exhibit remarkable transcriptional diversity, reflecting their multifaceted roles in health and disease. Recent advances in RNA sequencing technologies have enabled the detailed characterization of microglial transcriptomic signatures, revealing significant heterogeneity across different CNS regions and disease states. This review synthesizes current findings on microglial transcriptional profiles, highlighting the dynamic nature of these cells in response to environmental cues and pathological conditions. By integrating data from single-cell RNA sequencing studies, we explore the implications of microglial heterogeneity for CNS homeostasis and pathology, including neurodegenerative diseases, neuroinflammation, and brain development. Understanding the functional consequences of distinct microglial states is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic strategies. Future research directions are proposed to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying microglial function and their potential as biomarkers or therapeutic targets in CNS disorders. This work underscores the importance of microglial transcriptomics in advancing our knowledge of CNS biology."}
