{"Abstract": "The escalating crisis of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is intricately linked to global environmental changes, posing a significant threat to public health and ecosystems. This study explores the complex interplay between AMR and environmental factors, emphasizing the role of anthropogenic activities in exacerbating this issue. The widespread use and misuse of antibiotics in agriculture and healthcare have led to increased contamination of natural environments, fostering the proliferation of resistant strains. Climate change further complicates this scenario by altering ecosystems and influencing the distribution and persistence of pathogens and resistance genes. This research highlights the need for integrated strategies that address both AMR and environmental sustainability, advocating for policies that reduce antibiotic contamination and mitigate climate change impacts. By understanding the synergistic effects of these global challenges, we can develop more effective interventions to curb the spread of AMR and protect environmental and human health."}
