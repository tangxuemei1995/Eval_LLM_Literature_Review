{"Abstract": "Meiosis is a specialized form of cell division essential for sexual reproduction, characterized by the reduction of chromosome number and the generation of genetic diversity. This process involves intricate interactions between homologous chromosomes, including pairing, synapsis, and recombination. The precise choreography of these events ensures accurate segregation and the introduction of genetic variation through crossover interference. This review explores the evolutionary significance of meiosis, contrasting it with mitosis, and highlights the molecular mechanisms underlying homolog pairing and recombination. Understanding these processes provides insights into the evolutionary pressures shaping meiosis and its role in maintaining genomic integrity. The study of meiosis not only elucidates fundamental biological principles but also informs breeding strategies and genetic research."}
