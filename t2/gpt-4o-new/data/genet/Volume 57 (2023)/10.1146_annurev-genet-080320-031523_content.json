{"Abstract": "Transcriptionâ€“replication conflicts (TRCs) are increasingly recognized as a significant source of genomic instability, posing challenges to cellular integrity. These conflicts arise when the transcription machinery, primarily RNA polymerase, encounters the replisome during DNA replication, leading to potential collisions. Such interactions can result in replication stress, stalled replication forks, and DNA damage, necessitating robust DNA repair mechanisms. The intricate balance between origin firing and transcriptional activity is crucial in mitigating TRCs. Recent studies highlight the role of specific genomic regions and cellular conditions that exacerbate these conflicts, contributing to mutagenesis and chromosomal rearrangements. Understanding the molecular dynamics of TRCs and their resolution is essential for elucidating the mechanisms underlying genome maintenance and the etiology of various genetic disorders. This research underscores the importance of coordinated regulation of transcription and replication to preserve genomic stability."}
