{"Abstract": "RNA repair mechanisms, particularly those involving tRNA, have long been overshadowed by the more extensively studied DNA repair processes. This review delves into the intricate processes of tRNA restriction and splicing, highlighting the critical roles of end healing and end sealing in maintaining RNA integrity. Central to these processes are the enzymes polynucleotide kinaseâ€“phosphatase and RNA ligase, which facilitate the precise rejoining of RNA strands. Recent advancements in enzyme discovery have shed light on the sophisticated nature of these repair systems, revealing their potential as targets for therapeutic intervention. By exploring the molecular intricacies of tRNA repair, this study underscores the importance of RNA maintenance in cellular homeostasis and the potential for novel biotechnological applications. The findings suggest that RNA repair, though often overlooked, is a fundamental aspect of cellular biology, with significant implications for understanding genetic regulation and developing innovative treatments for RNA-related disorders."}
