{"Abstract": "Uncovering noncoding regulatory variants is crucial for understanding complex traits. This study explores strategies integrating genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with rare-variant association tests to identify potential enhancers. Machine learning models are employed to predict variant functionality, while functional assays validate their regulatory roles. By combining computational and experimental approaches, this research advances the identification of noncoding variants, offering insights into their contributions to phenotypic diversity and disease susceptibility."}
