{"Abstract": "Asymmetric stem cell division is a fundamental process that contributes to germline immortality by ensuring the maintenance of a pristine genetic lineage across generations. This study explores the mechanisms by which asymmetric division preserves cellular youthfulness, focusing on the role of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in aging and cellular senescence. We examine how differential distribution of cellular components during division influences the longevity of germline cells, contrasting with somatic cell aging. Our findings suggest that the selective retention of intact rDNA copies in germline cells is crucial for sustaining their immortality. Understanding these processes provides insights into the molecular underpinnings of aging and potential interventions to extend cellular lifespan."}
