{"Abstract": "The advent of CRISPR technology has revolutionized functional genomics, enabling precise genome editing at an unprecedented scale. This study explores the integration of pooled genome-scale CRISPR screens with single-cell analysis to enhance our understanding of gene function. By employing high-throughput cell sorting techniques, we can isolate and analyze individual cells that have undergone specific genetic modifications. This approach allows for the dissection of complex genetic interactions and the identification of novel gene functions within heterogeneous cell populations. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining CRISPR screens with single-cell genomics to uncover intricate cellular pathways and regulatory networks. This methodology not only accelerates the discovery of gene function but also provides insights into cellular heterogeneity and its implications in health and disease. The integration of these cutting-edge technologies marks a significant advancement in the field of genomics, offering new avenues for research and therapeutic development."}
