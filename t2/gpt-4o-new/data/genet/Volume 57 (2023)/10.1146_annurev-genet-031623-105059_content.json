{"Abstract": "This study explores the potential of CRISPR-based gene drives for manipulating wild populations, focusing on genetic biocontrol strategies. By employing homing mechanisms, CRISPR can facilitate population suppression or modification, offering innovative solutions for ecological management. The research evaluates the efficacy, ethical considerations, and ecological impacts of these technologies, highlighting their promise in addressing challenges such as invasive species control and biodiversity conservation."}
