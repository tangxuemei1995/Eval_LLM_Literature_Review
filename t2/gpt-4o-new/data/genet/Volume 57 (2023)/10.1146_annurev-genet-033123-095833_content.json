{"Abstract": "Programmed cell death (PCD) is a crucial biological process traditionally associated with multicellular organisms, where it plays a vital role in development, homeostasis, and defense mechanisms. However, recent studies have revealed that PCD also occurs in unicellular organisms, challenging the conventional understanding of its evolutionary origins and functions. This review explores the mechanisms and evolutionary significance of PCD in both unicellular and multicellular organisms, highlighting the similarities and differences in their regulatory pathways. In unicellular organisms, PCD may serve as a population control mechanism, enhance genetic diversity, or provide a competitive advantage under stress conditions. In contrast, multicellular organisms utilize PCD for tissue sculpting, immune responses, and the elimination of damaged cells. Understanding the diverse roles of PCD across different life forms not only provides insights into the evolution of complex life but also opens new avenues for biotechnological and medical applications targeting microbial and cellular processes."}
