{"Abstract": "Paramecium, a genus of unicellular ciliated protozoa, serves as a model organism for studying fundamental biological processes, including genetics, genomics, and evolution. This review synthesizes recent advances in the understanding of Paramecium genetics and genomics, highlighting its significance in evolutionary cell biology. The unique genomic architecture of Paramecium, characterized by extensive gene duplication and polyploidy, provides insights into genome evolution and adaptation mechanisms. Recent genomic studies have revealed the complexity of Paramecium's genetic makeup, including the presence of numerous paralogous gene families, which contribute to its adaptability and evolutionary success. Population genomics approaches have further elucidated the genetic diversity within and between Paramecium species, offering a deeper understanding of their evolutionary trajectories and speciation processes. The role of gene duplication in facilitating functional diversification and innovation is emphasized, showcasing Paramecium as a key organism for studying the evolutionary dynamics of gene families. Additionally, the integration of genomic data with ecological and phenotypic information has advanced our comprehension of the evolutionary pressures shaping Paramecium populations. This review underscores the importance of Paramecium as a model for exploring the interplay between genetic architecture and evolutionary processes, providing a framework for future research in evolutionary cell biology and genome evolution."}
