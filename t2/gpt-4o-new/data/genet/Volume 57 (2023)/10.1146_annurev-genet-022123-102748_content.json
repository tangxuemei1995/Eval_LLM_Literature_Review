{"Abstract": "Coral reefs are facing unprecedented challenges due to climate change, necessitating a deeper understanding of their adaptive potential. This study explores the population genomics of coral reef species, focusing on local adaptation, dispersal, and evolutionary rescue mechanisms. By analyzing genetic variation across multiple fish populations, we aim to identify genomic regions associated with resilience to environmental stressors. Our findings highlight the role of gene flow in facilitating adaptive responses, while also emphasizing the importance of local adaptation in maintaining population viability. The interplay between dispersal and selection pressures is crucial for predicting the evolutionary trajectories of coral reef species under changing climatic conditions. This research provides insights into the genetic basis of adaptation, offering potential strategies for conservation and management efforts aimed at preserving coral reef biodiversity in the face of global change."}
