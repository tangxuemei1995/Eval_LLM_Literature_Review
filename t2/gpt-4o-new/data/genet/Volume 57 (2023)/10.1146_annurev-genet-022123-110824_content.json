{"Abstract": "The integration of single-cell genomics with quantitative genetics offers a powerful approach to unravel the genetic underpinnings of complex traits. This study explores the potential of single-cell technologies to dissect gene expression and chromatin accessibility at unprecedented resolution, providing insights into the cellular heterogeneity underlying phenotypic diversity. By analyzing mutants and natural populations, we aim to identify genetic variants that influence cellular phenotypes, thereby linking genotype to phenotype at the single-cell level. Our approach leverages population genetics frameworks to interpret the effects of genetic variation on cellular function, facilitating the discovery of novel regulatory elements and pathways. This research not only enhances our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits but also paves the way for precision medicine applications by identifying cell-type-specific genetic determinants of disease."}
