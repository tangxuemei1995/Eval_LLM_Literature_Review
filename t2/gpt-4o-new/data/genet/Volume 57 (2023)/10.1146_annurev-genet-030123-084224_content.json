{"Abstract": "Systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAIDs) are a group of disorders characterized by dysregulated innate immune responses, often driven by genetic factors. This review explores the genetic underpinnings of SAIDs, highlighting the roles of monogenic, digenic, and polygenic contributions to disease pathogenesis. Recent advances in genomics have elucidated key mutations in genes such as NLRP3, MEFV, and TNFRSF1A, which are pivotal in monogenic SAIDs. Additionally, digenic and polygenic models reveal complex interactions between multiple genetic loci, contributing to disease variability and severity. Epigenetic modifications and somatic mutations further complicate the genetic landscape, influencing gene expression and immune function. Understanding these genetic mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted therapies and improving diagnostic precision in SAIDs."}
