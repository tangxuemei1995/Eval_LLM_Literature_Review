{"Abstract": "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have revolutionized the study of human disease biology by offering a versatile platform for modeling genetic disorders and understanding gene regulation. This review explores the utility of iPSCs in recapitulating disease phenotypes and their potential in generating organoids that mimic human tissue architecture. By reprogramming somatic cells, iPSCs provide an invaluable tool for dissecting the genetic underpinnings of diseases, enabling researchers to investigate pathophysiological mechanisms in a controlled in vitro environment. The integration of iPSCs with advanced genetic and bioengineering techniques holds promise for personalized medicine, offering insights into disease progression and therapeutic responses. This paper underscores the transformative impact of iPSCs in bridging the gap between basic research and clinical applications."}
