{"Abstract": "This study delves into the intricate interplay between phenomenology, resilience, and vulnerability in shaping individual identity through the lens of autobiography. By examining personal narratives, the research highlights how unforeseen life events influence socialization processes and contribute to the development of resilience. The phenomenological approach provides a framework for understanding the subjective experiences of individuals as they navigate challenges, revealing the dynamic nature of identity formation. Vulnerability emerges as a pivotal factor, not only as a source of potential adversity but also as a catalyst for personal growth and resilience. Through a comprehensive analysis of autobiographical accounts, the study underscores the significance of socialization in reinforcing or reshaping identity in response to life's unpredictabilities. This research contributes to the broader discourse on identity by offering insights into how individuals construct meaning and adapt to changing circumstances, ultimately enhancing our understanding of the human capacity for resilience in the face of vulnerability."}
