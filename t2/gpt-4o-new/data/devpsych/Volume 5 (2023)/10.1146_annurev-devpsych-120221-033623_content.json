{"Abstract": "The intersection of life-course epidemiology and causal inference presents a unique opportunity to enhance our understanding of health trajectories and their determinants. This paper explores the methodological tensions that arise when integrating these two fields, particularly focusing on the challenges and opportunities in applying causal inference techniques to life-course data. We examine the potential of quantitative methods, such as natural experiments, to address these challenges and provide robust insights into the causal pathways influencing health outcomes over time. By critically analyzing existing literature and case studies, we identify key areas where life-course epidemiology can benefit from the rigorous application of causal inference methods. Furthermore, we propose a framework for bridging the divide between these disciplines, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and methodological innovation. Our findings suggest that a more integrated approach can lead to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between biological, social, and environmental factors across the lifespan, ultimately informing more effective public health interventions and policies."}
