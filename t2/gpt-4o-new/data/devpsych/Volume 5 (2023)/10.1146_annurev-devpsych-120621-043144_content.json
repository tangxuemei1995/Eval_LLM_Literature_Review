{"Abstract": "The offspring of depressed parents are at heightened risk for developing psychological and neurobiological challenges. This review synthesizes current findings on the psychobiological functioning of these individuals, emphasizing alterations in brain structure and function. Recent studies highlight significant deviations in neural circuits associated with emotion regulation and stress response, potentially predisposing these offspring to mood disorders. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated these vulnerabilities, with increased exposure to stressors and reduced access to mental health resources. Despite advancements, unresolved issues remain, including the need for longitudinal studies to disentangle genetic and environmental influences. Future research should focus on integrating multi-modal imaging techniques and exploring the impact of early interventions. Understanding the interplay between genetic predispositions and environmental factors is crucial for developing targeted prevention and treatment strategies. This work underscores the importance of addressing the mental health needs of this at-risk population, particularly in the context of global crises."}
