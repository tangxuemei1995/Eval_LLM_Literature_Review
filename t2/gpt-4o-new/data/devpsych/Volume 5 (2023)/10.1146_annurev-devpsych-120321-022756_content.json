{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate dynamics of social identity development through the lens of intersectionality, focusing on youth as a pivotal demographic. By employing a mixed-methods approach, the research integrates qualitative and quantitative data to provide a comprehensive understanding of how intersecting identities such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status influence developmental trajectories. The interdisciplinary framework draws on critical race theory to interrogate the systemic structures that shape identity formation. The findings reveal that identity development is not a linear process but rather a complex interplay of multiple social categories that interact in unique ways for each individual. This research underscores the importance of considering intersectionality in developmental studies to better address the diverse experiences of youth. The study also highlights the need for more inclusive and nuanced methodologies that can capture the multifaceted nature of identity. By advancing the conversation on the 'what' and 'how' of identity development, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of the social forces that impact youth and offers insights for educators, policymakers, and practitioners."}
