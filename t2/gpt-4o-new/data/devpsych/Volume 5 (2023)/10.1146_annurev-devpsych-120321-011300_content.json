{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate processes underlying the neurodevelopment of attention, learning, and memory systems during infancy. By examining the dynamic interplay between neural maturation and environmental interactions, we aim to elucidate how foundational cognitive abilities emerge and evolve in early life. Utilizing a combination of neuroimaging techniques and behavioral assessments, we investigate the developmental trajectories of attention and learning mechanisms, highlighting critical periods of sensitivity and plasticity. Our findings suggest that the maturation of attentional networks is pivotal for the subsequent development of learning and memory systems, with significant implications for cognitive development. Furthermore, we identify key factors influencing these processes, including genetic predispositions and early life experiences. This research underscores the importance of early interventions and enriched environments in optimizing neurodevelopmental outcomes, providing insights into potential strategies for supporting cognitive growth in infancy. The study contributes to a deeper understanding of the foundational stages of human cognitive development."}
