{"Abstract": "Cognitive flexibility, a core component of executive function, is crucial for adaptive behavior and problem-solving. This review synthesizes recent advancements in developmental neuroimaging studies focusing on cognitive flexibility, particularly through task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We explore how neural substrates supporting cognitive flexibility evolve from childhood through adolescence, highlighting the maturation of prefrontal and parietal cortices. Emerging evidence suggests that these regions undergo significant structural and functional changes, facilitating improved cognitive flexibility. We also discuss methodological advancements in task fMRI that enhance our understanding of the dynamic neural processes underlying cognitive flexibility. Furthermore, we identify gaps in current research, such as the need for longitudinal studies and the integration of multimodal imaging techniques. Future directions include exploring the impact of environmental and genetic factors on the neurodevelopment of cognitive flexibility, aiming to inform interventions that support optimal cognitive development."}
