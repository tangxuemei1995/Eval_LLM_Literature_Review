{"Abstract": "This study explores the intersection of developmental social neuroscience and early intervention strategies for infants at risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). By integrating insights from neuroscience, psychology, and early childhood development, the research aims to enhance understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying social and cognitive development in infants. The focus is on identifying critical periods of brain plasticity and the potential for targeted interventions to modify developmental trajectories. Through a review of current literature and recent empirical findings, the study highlights the role of early social experiences in shaping neural circuits associated with social cognition and communication. It also examines the efficacy of various intervention approaches, such as parent-mediated therapies and sensory integration techniques, in promoting adaptive neural and behavioral outcomes. The findings underscore the importance of early detection and personalized intervention strategies, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to optimize developmental outcomes for infants at risk of ASD. This perspective offers a promising framework for future research and clinical practice."}
