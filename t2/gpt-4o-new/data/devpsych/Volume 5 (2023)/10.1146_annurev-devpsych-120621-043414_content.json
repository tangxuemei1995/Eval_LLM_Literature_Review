{"Abstract": "Prenatal substance exposure is a critical area of research due to its significant implications for developmental outcomes. This study examines the impact of prenatal adversity, particularly focusing on substance use during pregnancy, on early childhood development. The research synthesizes findings from recent literature to explore how exposure to substances such as alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs can affect fetal development and lead to long-term cognitive, behavioral, and health challenges. By analyzing data from various cohort studies, the research highlights the mechanisms through which prenatal substance exposure contributes to early adversity and its subsequent effects on developmental trajectories. The findings underscore the importance of early intervention and support for pregnant individuals to mitigate adverse outcomes. This study aims to inform healthcare policies and practices to better address the needs of affected populations, ultimately improving developmental outcomes for children exposed to prenatal substance use."}
