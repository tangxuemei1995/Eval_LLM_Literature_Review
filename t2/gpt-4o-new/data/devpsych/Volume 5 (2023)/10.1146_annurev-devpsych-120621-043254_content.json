{"Abstract": "This study explores the efficacy of early socioemotional interventions aimed at enhancing the parent–infant relationship, with a focus on improving parental sensitivity and fostering secure attachment. Utilizing a comprehensive review of recent literature, the research highlights the critical period of infancy as a window of opportunity for interventions that can significantly influence developmental trajectories. The interventions examined include structured programs that train parents in responsive caregiving techniques, promoting emotional attunement and reducing stressors that may impede healthy attachment formation. Findings suggest that such interventions not only bolster parental sensitivity but also contribute to improved socioemotional outcomes in infants, including increased emotional regulation and social competence. The study underscores the importance of early, targeted support for families, advocating for the integration of these interventions into broader public health strategies to optimize developmental outcomes and enhance the parent–infant bond."}
