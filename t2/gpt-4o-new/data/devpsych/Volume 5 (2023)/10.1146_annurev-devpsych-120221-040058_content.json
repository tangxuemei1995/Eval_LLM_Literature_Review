{"Abstract": "This study explores the development of cognitive control in childhood through a rational account framework, emphasizing the interplay between competence and maturation. Cognitive control, the ability to regulate thoughts and actions in accordance with internal goals, is crucial for adaptive behavior and undergoes significant development during childhood. We propose that this development can be understood as a rational adaptation to the expected value of control in varying contexts. By integrating theories of cognitive maturation with models of rational decision-making, we provide a comprehensive account of how children optimize their cognitive resources. Our analysis suggests that the observed improvements in cognitive control are not merely a result of increased competence but also reflect strategic adaptations to environmental demands. This perspective offers new insights into the mechanisms underlying cognitive control development and highlights the importance of considering both biological maturation and experiential factors. The findings have implications for educational strategies and interventions aimed at enhancing cognitive control in children."}
