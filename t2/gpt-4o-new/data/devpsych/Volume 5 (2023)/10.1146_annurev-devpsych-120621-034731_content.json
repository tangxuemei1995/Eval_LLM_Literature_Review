{"Abstract": "This study explores the intricate process by which young children acquire and apply social norms, a fundamental aspect of norm psychology and social-cognitive development. By examining the mechanisms through which children internalize and enact norms, the research highlights the interplay between normativity and morality in early childhood. The study employs a multi-method approach, integrating observational data, experimental tasks, and parental reports to assess children's understanding and application of norms in various social contexts. Findings suggest that children as young as three years old demonstrate a sophisticated grasp of normative concepts, which they apply to guide their behavior and evaluate the actions of others. The results underscore the role of social interactions and cultural context in shaping children's normative understanding. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the developmental trajectory of norm acquisition and its implications for moral development, offering insights into the foundational aspects of human social behavior."}
