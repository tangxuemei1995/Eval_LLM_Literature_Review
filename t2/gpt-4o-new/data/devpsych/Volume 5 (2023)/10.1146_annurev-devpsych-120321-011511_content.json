{"Abstract": "This study explores adolescent development through a neuroecosocial lens, integrating neurological, ecological, and social dimensions to understand the multifaceted challenges faced by youth today. By employing youth-led methods, the research emphasizes the importance of adolescent voices in shaping interventions and policies. The study examines how mental health is influenced by social inequalities, urbanicity, and the ongoing climate crisis, highlighting the interconnectedness of these factors. Findings suggest that urban environments and socio-economic disparities significantly impact adolescent mental health, while the climate crisis exacerbates existing vulnerabilities. The research advocates for holistic approaches that address these complex interactions, promoting resilience and well-being among adolescents. This perspective underscores the necessity of interdisciplinary strategies to foster supportive environments that mitigate the adverse effects of these global challenges on young peopleâ€™s development."}
