{"Abstract": "This review explores the intricate relationship between poverty, brain development, and mental health, emphasizing recent advancements and ongoing challenges in the field. Adversity, often stemming from socioeconomic deprivation, has been shown to significantly impact neurodevelopmental trajectories, as evidenced by neuroimaging studies. These studies reveal alterations in brain structures and functions associated with developmental psychopathology, including anxiety, depression, and cognitive impairments. Despite these insights, the field faces challenges related to replicability and reproducibility of findings, which are crucial for establishing robust scientific evidence. Methodological improvements and larger, more diverse sample sizes are needed to enhance the reliability of research outcomes. The review also highlights potential paths forward, including interdisciplinary approaches and policy interventions aimed at mitigating the adverse effects of poverty on brain development. By addressing these challenges, the research community can better inform strategies to promote mental health and resilience in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations."}
