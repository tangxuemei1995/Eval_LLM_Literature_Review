{"Abstract": "This study synthesizes research on the cognitive mechanisms and socialization processes that underpin children's racial learning. By integrating findings from developmental psychology, sociology, and education, we explore how ethnic-racial socialization influences children's understanding of race. The review highlights the role of family, peers, and media in shaping racial attitudes and identities, emphasizing the dynamic interplay between individual cognitive development and social context. We discuss how children internalize racial norms and stereotypes through direct and indirect socialization practices, and how these processes vary across different cultural and socio-economic environments. The paper calls for a more nuanced understanding of racial learning, advocating for interventions that promote positive racial identity and intergroup relations from an early age. Future research directions are proposed to further elucidate these complex interactions."}
