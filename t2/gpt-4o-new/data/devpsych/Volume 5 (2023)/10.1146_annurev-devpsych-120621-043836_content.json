{"Abstract": "This study explores the dynamics of emotion regulation within couples across different stages of adulthood, emphasizing the impact of aging on emotional processes. Utilizing a longitudinal design, we examined how couples navigate emotional challenges and the strategies they employ to maintain relational harmony. The research draws on a diverse sample of couples, ranging from early adulthood to late adulthood, to assess variations in emotion regulation strategies and their effectiveness over time. Findings suggest that older couples tend to employ more adaptive emotion regulation strategies, such as cognitive reappraisal and mutual support, compared to younger couples who may rely more on suppression. These adaptive strategies are linked to higher relationship satisfaction and emotional well-being. The study highlights the importance of understanding age-related changes in emotion regulation within intimate relationships, offering insights into how couples can foster resilience and emotional intimacy throughout the aging process. Implications for therapeutic interventions aimed at enhancing relationship quality are discussed."}
