{"Abstract": "This study explores the representation of third-party helping interactions in infancy, focusing on the cognitive mechanisms that underpin infants' understanding of social interactions involving assistance. The research investigates how infants perceive and interpret helping behaviors, particularly in scenarios where they are not directly involved but are observers of such interactions. By examining infants' responses to various helping situations, the study aims to shed light on the early development of social cognition and goal attribution. The methodology involves a series of controlled experiments where infants are presented with animated or live-action scenarios depicting helping behaviors between third parties. The infants' gaze patterns, emotional responses, and subsequent actions are analyzed to infer their understanding of the goals and intentions behind the helping interactions. Results indicate that even at a young age, infants are capable of recognizing and attributing goals to helping behaviors, suggesting that the foundations of social cognition and the ability to interpret others' actions are present early in life. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of how social cognitive skills develop and the role of observational learning in infancy. The study highlights the importance of early social experiences in shaping infants' understanding of complex social interactions, with implications for developmental psychology and early childhood education."}
