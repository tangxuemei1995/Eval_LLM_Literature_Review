{"Abstract": "The intricate interplay between the immune system and epithelial tissues is pivotal in orchestrating effective regeneration and repair processes. This review delves into the dynamic cross talk between immune cells and epithelial stem cells, highlighting their collaborative roles in maintaining tissue homeostasis and responding to injury. The immune system, through its diverse cell types and signaling molecules, not only orchestrates the initial inflammatory response but also modulates the subsequent phases of tissue repair and regeneration. Epithelial stem cells, in turn, respond to immune-derived signals to proliferate and differentiate, ensuring the restoration of tissue integrity. Dysregulation in this cross talk can lead to chronic inflammatory diseases and impaired healing. Recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying immune-epithelial interactions offer promising therapeutic avenues for enhancing tissue repair and treating inflammatory disorders. This review underscores the importance of a balanced immune response in epithelial regeneration and the potential of targeting immune-epithelial pathways to improve clinical outcomes in regenerative medicine."}
