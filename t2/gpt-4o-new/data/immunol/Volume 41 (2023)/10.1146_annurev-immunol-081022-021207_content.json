{"Abstract": "The NLRP3 inflammasome is a critical component of the innate immune system, playing a pivotal role in the host defense against pathogens and in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases. This study elucidates the structural mechanisms underlying the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Utilizing advanced cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, we reveal the conformational changes in NLRP3 that facilitate its oligomerization and interaction with the adaptor protein ASC. Our findings demonstrate that ASC forms filamentous structures that serve as a scaffold for the recruitment and activation of pro-caspase-1. The subsequent cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into its active form initiates a cascade of inflammatory responses. These insights into the molecular architecture of the NLRP3 inflammasome provide a comprehensive understanding of its activation mechanism, offering potential targets for therapeutic intervention in diseases characterized by excessive inflammation. This research advances our knowledge of inflammasome biology and its implications in immune regulation."}
