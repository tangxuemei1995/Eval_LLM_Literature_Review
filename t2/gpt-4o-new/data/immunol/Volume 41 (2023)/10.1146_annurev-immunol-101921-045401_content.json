{"Abstract": "RNA modifications, particularly N6-methyladenosine (m6A), play crucial roles in regulating immune responses. This review explores the epitranscriptomic landscape, highlighting how m6A modifications influence antiviral and antitumor immunity. By modulating mRNA stability, translation, and splicing, m6A impacts immune cell differentiation and function. In the tumor microenvironment, m6A modifications can either promote or inhibit tumor progression, affecting immune surveillance and response. Understanding these mechanisms offers potential therapeutic avenues for enhancing immune responses against infections and cancer, underscoring the significance of RNA modifications in immune regulation."}
