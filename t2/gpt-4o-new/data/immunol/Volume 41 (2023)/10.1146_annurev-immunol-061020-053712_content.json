{"Abstract": "Immunoglobulin E (IgE) plays a pivotal role in allergic responses, interacting with high-affinity FcεRI and low-affinity CD23 receptors. This study delves into the structural intricacies of IgE and its receptors, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underpinning their interactions. Recent advances in crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy have unveiled detailed conformations of IgE-FcεRI and IgE-CD23 complexes, highlighting key allosteric sites that modulate receptor binding and signaling. These insights have propelled the development of anti-IgE biologics, such as omalizumab, which disrupt IgE-receptor interactions, offering therapeutic potential for allergic diseases. The review synthesizes current knowledge on the structural dynamics of IgE and its receptors, emphasizing the allosteric modulation mechanisms that inform the design of next-generation biologics. Understanding these protein structures and their functional mechanisms is crucial for advancing targeted therapies in allergy management, potentially transforming clinical approaches to allergic disorders."}
