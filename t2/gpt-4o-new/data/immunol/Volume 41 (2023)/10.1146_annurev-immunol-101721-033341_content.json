{"Abstract": "Endogenous retroelements, including endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), represent a significant portion of the mammalian genome and play complex roles in host immunity. This study explores the immunological paradox posed by these elements, which can both trigger and evade immune responses. ERVs are known to activate the interferon response, a critical component of the innate immune system, through the recognition of viral-like sequences. However, they also contribute to immune regulation and the development of adaptive immunity by influencing gene expression and genomic stability. The dual nature of ERVs in modulating immune responses presents a conundrum, as they can act as both pathogens and symbionts. Understanding the balance between these roles is crucial for elucidating their impact on immune homeostasis and disease. This review synthesizes current research on the mechanisms by which endogenous retroelements interact with the immune system, highlighting their potential as targets for therapeutic intervention in autoimmune and infectious diseases."}
