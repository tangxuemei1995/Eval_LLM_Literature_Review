{"Abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells, a critical component of the innate immune system, play a pivotal role in the human uterine mucosa, particularly during early pregnancy. This study explores the unique characteristics and functions of uterine NK (uNK) cells within the decidua, the specialized endometrial tissue that forms during pregnancy. Unlike peripheral NK cells, uNK cells exhibit a distinct phenotype and are involved in the regulation of trophoblast invasion and vascular remodeling, essential processes for successful implantation and placental development. The interaction between uNK cells and trophoblasts is crucial for maintaining a balance between immune tolerance and defense, ensuring fetal-maternal harmony. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms governing uNK cell activity, their role in reproductive success, and potential implications for pregnancy-related disorders. Understanding the dynamics of uNK cells in the decidua could lead to novel therapeutic strategies for conditions such as recurrent miscarriage and preeclampsia, highlighting their significance in reproductive immunology."}
