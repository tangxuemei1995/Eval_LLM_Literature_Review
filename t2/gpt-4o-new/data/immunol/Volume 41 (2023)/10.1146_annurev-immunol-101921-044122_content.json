{"Abstract": "The development of cancer immunotherapies that effectively engage both T cells and natural killer (NK) cells represents a promising frontier in oncology. This study explores innovative strategies to harness the synergistic potential of these immune cells to enhance anti-tumor responses. T cells, with their ability to recognize specific antigens, and NK cells, known for their innate ability to target tumor cells, offer complementary mechanisms of action. By designing therapies that simultaneously activate these cell types, we aim to overcome the limitations of current treatments that often target only one immune pathway. Our research focuses on the identification of novel targets and the engineering of bispecific antibodies and cytokine-based therapies to potentiate the dual engagement of T cells and NK cells. Preliminary results demonstrate enhanced tumor clearance and improved survival rates in preclinical models, underscoring the potential of this approach to transform cancer treatment paradigms."}
