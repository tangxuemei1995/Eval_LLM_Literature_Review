{"Abstract": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) is a pivotal cytokine in the regulation of T cell biology, influencing a diverse array of T cell subsets including CD4+ T helper cells, CD8+ T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), innate lymphoid cells, intraepithelial lymphocytes, and γδ T cells. TGF-β plays a crucial role in maintaining T cell quiescence and modulating activation, thereby ensuring immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity. It orchestrates the differentiation and function of Tregs, promoting immune tolerance, while also modulating the effector functions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In innate lymphoid cells and intraepithelial lymphocytes, TGF-β influences tissue-specific immune responses and barrier integrity. Furthermore, TGF-β signaling is integral to the development and function of γδ T cells, which are key players in mucosal immunity. This review synthesizes current insights into the multifaceted roles of TGF-β in T cell regulation, highlighting its therapeutic potential in immune-mediated diseases."}
