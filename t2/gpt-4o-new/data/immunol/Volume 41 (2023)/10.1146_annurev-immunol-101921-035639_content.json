{"Abstract": "The complement system, traditionally recognized for its role in immune defense, has emerged as a critical player in the central nervous system (CNS), influencing neuroprotection, neuronal plasticity, and neuroinflammation. This review explores the multifaceted contributions of complement proteins, particularly C1q, in the brain. C1q, a key initiator of the classical complement pathway, is implicated in synaptic pruning, a process essential for neuronal plasticity and cognitive function. Dysregulation of complement activity, however, can lead to excessive synaptic loss and neuroinflammation, contributing to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the CNS, interact with complement components to mediate these processes, highlighting their dual role in maintaining homeostasis and driving pathology. Understanding the balance of complement activity in the brain may offer novel therapeutic targets for modulating neuroinflammation and preserving cognitive function in neurodegenerative disorders."}
