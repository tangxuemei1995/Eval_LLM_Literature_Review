{"Abstract": "The origin and heterogeneity of tissue myeloid cells, particularly those derived from granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs), are critical for understanding immune responses and tissue homeostasis. This study delves into the differentiation pathways of GMP-derived monocytes and neutrophils, employing advanced fate-mapping techniques to trace their lineage and functional diversification. We explore the influence of microenvironmental niches on the reprogramming of these cells, highlighting the dynamic interplay between intrinsic genetic programs and extrinsic signals. Our findings reveal distinct transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes that govern the fate decisions of GMP-derived cells, contributing to the functional heterogeneity observed in tissue-resident macrophages and neutrophils. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying myeloid cell differentiation and adaptation, this research provides insights into potential therapeutic strategies for modulating immune responses in various pathological conditions, including inflammation and cancer. The study underscores the importance of the tissue microenvironment in shaping the identity and function of myeloid cells."}
