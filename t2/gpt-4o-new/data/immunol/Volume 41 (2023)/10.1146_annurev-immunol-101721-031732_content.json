{"Abstract": "Effector-triggered immunity (ETI) represents a crucial component of the plant immune system, acting as a second line of defense following the initial recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). This study explores the intricate mechanisms underlying ETI, which is activated upon the detection of specific pathogen-derived virulence factors, known as effectors, by intracellular immune receptors. These receptors, often nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat proteins (NLRs), play a pivotal role in recognizing and responding to effector molecules, thereby triggering robust immune responses. The research delves into the interplay between innate immunity and ETI, highlighting the concept of guard immunity, where NLRs monitor the integrity of host proteins targeted by effectors. By examining the molecular interactions and signaling pathways involved, this study enhances our understanding of how plants effectively counteract pathogen attacks. The findings underscore the potential for leveraging ETI in developing disease-resistant crops, offering promising avenues for sustainable agricultural practices."}
