{"Abstract": "T cell fate determination is a critical process in the adaptive immune response, influencing the development of various T cell subsets with distinct functions. This study presents a comprehensive mathematical model to elucidate the mechanisms governing T cell fate decisions. By integrating signaling pathways, gene expression profiles, and environmental cues, the model predicts T cell differentiation outcomes under various conditions. The model's predictions were validated against experimental data, demonstrating its potential to enhance our understanding of T cell biology. This approach provides a valuable framework for exploring therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating T cell responses in diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders."}
