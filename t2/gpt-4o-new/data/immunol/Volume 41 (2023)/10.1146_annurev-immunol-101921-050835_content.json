{"Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has highlighted the critical role of the immune response in disease severity, particularly in cases of severe pneumonia. This study investigates the mechanisms by which type I interferons (IFNs) are disrupted in critical COVID-19 cases. We explore the genetic predispositions and the presence of anticytokine autoantibodies that interfere with IFN signaling pathways. Our findings suggest that genetic mutations affecting IFN production and function, along with autoantibodies targeting IFNs, contribute significantly to the impaired antiviral response observed in severe cases. This disruption leads to uncontrolled viral replication and exacerbated inflammatory responses, culminating in critical pneumonia. Understanding these mechanisms provides insights into potential therapeutic targets and strategies to enhance IFN responses, offering hope for improved management of severe COVID-19. This research underscores the importance of personalized medicine approaches in treating viral infections with complex immune interactions."}
