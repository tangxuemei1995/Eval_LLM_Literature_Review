{"Abstract": "The study investigates T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2, focusing on the impact of viral variants, infection, and vaccination on immune dynamics. T cells play a crucial role in mediating immune protection against COVID-19, influencing disease severity and recovery. We analyzed T cell epitopes across different SARS-CoV-2 variants to assess their immunogenicity and potential escape from immune surveillance. Our findings reveal that while some variants exhibit altered epitope presentation, T cell responses remain robust, suggesting a degree of cross-protection. Furthermore, vaccination enhances T cell reactivity, contributing to reduced disease severity upon breakthrough infections. The study underscores the importance of T cell immunity in the context of evolving viral variants and highlights the need for vaccines that elicit broad and durable T cell responses. These insights are critical for guiding future vaccine design and public health strategies to combat COVID-19 effectively."}
