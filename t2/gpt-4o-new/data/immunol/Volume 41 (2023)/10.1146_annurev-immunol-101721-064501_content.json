{"Abstract": "Aging is associated with significant alterations in the immune system, a phenomenon known as immunosenescence, characterized by the accumulation of extremely differentiated T cell subsets. This study explores the impact of these subsets on tissue deterioration during aging. Thymus involution, a hallmark of aging, leads to reduced T cell output, contributing to an imbalance in lymphocyte populations. The accumulation of senescent T cells, which exhibit pro-inflammatory phenotypes, exacerbates chronic inflammation, further accelerating tissue damage. Our findings suggest that these differentiated T cell subsets play a critical role in the aging process by promoting a pro-inflammatory environment and impairing tissue homeostasis. Understanding the mechanisms underlying T cell-driven tissue deterioration could inform therapeutic strategies to mitigate age-related diseases and improve healthspan."}
