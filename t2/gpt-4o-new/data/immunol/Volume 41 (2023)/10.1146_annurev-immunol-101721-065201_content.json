{"Abstract": "The study of immunology has long relied on murine models to elucidate the mechanisms underlying immune responses and susceptibility to infectious diseases. However, the translational gap between mouse and human immunology remains a significant challenge, particularly in understanding genetic susceptibility and inborn errors of immunity. This review explores the intersection of mouse and human genetics in the context of immunodeficiency and infectious diseases, highlighting recent advances that bridge this gap. By examining genetic parallels and divergences, we aim to reconcile differences in immune function and disease susceptibility across species. Key insights from human genetics, including the identification of novel inborn errors of immunity, are juxtaposed with murine models to enhance our understanding of genetic predispositions to infectious diseases. The integration of genomic technologies and cross-species genetic analyses offers a promising avenue for uncovering the genetic underpinnings of immune responses. Ultimately, this synthesis of mouse and human immunology at the genetic level holds the potential to inform the development of targeted therapies and improve clinical outcomes for individuals with immunodeficiencies."}
