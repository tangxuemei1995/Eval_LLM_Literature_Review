{"Abstract": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies and widespread inflammation. Recent advances in understanding SLE pathogenesis have highlighted the pivotal role of type I interferons (IFNs) in disease progression. IFNs contribute to the dysregulation of immune responses, promoting the survival and activation of autoreactive B cells and the production of autoantibodies. Beyond IFNs, emerging evidence suggests that aberrant cell death pathways, particularly involving mitochondria, play a crucial role in SLE. Mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which further stimulate the immune system and perpetuate inflammation. Additionally, the extrafollicular response, a process where B cells rapidly differentiate into plasma cells outside of germinal centers, has been implicated in the production of pathogenic autoantibodies in SLE. This extrafollicular pathway may bypass traditional tolerance checkpoints, contributing to the persistence of autoreactive B cells. Understanding the interplay between these mechanisms is essential for developing targeted therapies. Current research is focused on identifying novel therapeutic targets that can modulate these pathways, offering hope for more effective treatments for SLE patients. This review synthesizes recent findings on the multifaceted pathogenesis of SLE, emphasizing the roles of IFNs, mitochondrial dysfunction, and extrafollicular B cell responses."}
