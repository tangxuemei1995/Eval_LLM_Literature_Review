{"Abstract": "Inflammatory anemia is a complex condition characterized by the interplay between immune responses and erythropoiesis. This review explores the underlying immune mechanisms contributing to anemia in inflammatory states, focusing on conditions such as malaria, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), and sickle cell anemia. Inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, play pivotal roles in disrupting iron homeostasis and inhibiting erythropoietin production, leading to reduced red blood cell synthesis. Hemophagocytes, activated during HLH, further exacerbate anemia by engulfing erythrocytes and their precursors. In malaria, the immune response to Plasmodium infection results in hemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis. Sickle cell anemia presents a unique inflammatory profile where chronic inflammation and vaso-occlusive crises contribute to anemia. Understanding these immune mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted therapies to mitigate anemia in inflammatory diseases, improving patient outcomes and quality of life."}
