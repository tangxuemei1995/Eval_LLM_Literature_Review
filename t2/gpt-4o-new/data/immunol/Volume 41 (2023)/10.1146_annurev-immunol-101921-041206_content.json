{"Abstract": "Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and Interleukin-13 (IL-13) are pivotal cytokines in the regulation and execution of wound repair processes, particularly within the context of type 2 immunity. These cytokines are integral to the modulation of inflammation and the remodeling of the extracellular matrix, which are crucial for effective tissue repair following injury. IL-4 and IL-13 orchestrate a complex network of cellular responses that facilitate the resolution of inflammation and promote tissue regeneration. Their roles extend to the modulation of macrophage activation states, influencing the transition from a pro-inflammatory to a reparative phenotype. Additionally, these cytokines are involved in the response to helminth infections, where they contribute to the repair of tissue damage caused by parasitic invasion. Understanding the dual roles of IL-4 and IL-13 as both regulators and effectors in wound healing provides insights into therapeutic strategies for enhancing tissue repair and managing chronic inflammatory conditions."}
